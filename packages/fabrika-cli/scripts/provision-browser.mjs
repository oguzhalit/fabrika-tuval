/**
 * Provision the headless browser `fabrika ui render` needs, **as part of installing the package**.
 *
 * The founder preference this encodes: default-available beats install-a-thing. No operator and no
 * agent ever runs a separate browser-install step by hand, so it rides `postinstall` — which is the
 * only moment that is guaranteed to happen once per install, for a workspace member and for an
 * adopter's `pnpm add -g @kampus/fabrika-cli` alike.
 *
 * It is **best-effort by design and never fails the install.** A hard failure here would break
 * `pnpm install` for everyone over a capability only one verb needs, and the run-time story is
 * already fail-closed and actionable: `ui render` exits `11` naming the exact remediation command.
 *
 * Three skips, each a real provisioning state rather than a convenience:
 *   - `FABRIKA_SKIP_BROWSER_PROVISION=1` — the explicit opt-out.
 *   - `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` set — a managed/prebaked install already owns the browsers.
 *   - `CI` set with no prebaked path — CI images bake their own browsers, and a ~130MB download in
 *     every job of every workflow is a cost no job asked for. The run-time `11` covers the case
 *     where a CI job really did need it.
