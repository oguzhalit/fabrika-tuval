# @kampus/fabrika-cli

## What it is

The deterministic verb package the [fabrika](../../claude-plugins/fabrika/) skills call.
`fabrika <group> <verb> …` dispatches to a registered verb group. fabrika is a two-layer split:
deterministic work is pushed into CLI verbs, and each skill is a thin wrapper carrying only the
judgment that cannot be mechanized. This package is the deterministic layer.

It is internal tooling for the kamp.us agent pipeline, not a general-purpose CLI. It ships on the
public npm registry so a consumer repo can pin a version of it. For what fabrika as a whole is, read
[the guide](../../claude-plugins/fabrika/guide/README.md).

## Why it exists

- Which copy of the binary answers an invocation, and why a copy from another repository is refused
  rather than delegated to: ADR
  [0287](../../.decisions/0287-delegation-stays-inside-one-repository.md).
- The GitHub credential order, and why `gh` is a convenience rather than a prerequisite: ADR
  [0315](../../.decisions/0315-fabrika-cli-github-token-resolution-and-the-three-non-rest-carves.md).
- Why this package re-implements v1's work and never calls into it: ADR
  [0238](../../.decisions/0238-fabrika-reimplements-v1-never-calls-it.md). v1 is deleted, so that is
  history rather than a live constraint.

## How to use it

```bash
pnpm add --global @kampus/fabrika-cli
fabrika --help
```

Inside a phoenix checkout you can skip the install and run the working tree:
`node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts --help`.

Every verb that touches GitHub needs a credential in the environment — `GITHUB_TOKEN`, else
`GH_TOKEN`. With neither set and `gh` on `PATH`, the credential is resolved once from an existing
login before any request. A credential that resolves nowhere is a refusal naming both variables,
never an anonymous call. There is no `gh` prerequisite: the package reaches api.github.com over HTTP
([`src/io/gh-api.ts`](./src/io/gh-api.ts)), and `guard no-gh check` keeps it that way on every push.

This package installs into repositories that are not the one it is developed in, so neither its
source nor the plugin's skills may carry a reference that only resolves here. `guard
portability-guard check` holds that on every push: it walks `claude-plugins/fabrika/` and
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/` and reds a ticket number, a decision-record number in either spelling, a
`.decisions/` path, a hosted issue or pull-request URL, and any name the repo declares under the
`portability` key of `.fabrika.jsonc`. A markdown heading, a hex colour and a ticket number that is
test data are not references. Neither is an `@ruling <issue url>` citation under
`packages/fabrika-cli/`: a docblock here cites the ruling issue that governs it rather than a
decision record, because a decision-record number means something else in the next repository
([ADR 0394](../../.decisions/0394-a-fabrika-cli-docblock-cites-its-ruling-issue.md)). Only the tag's
own span is admitted, so prose sharing the line is scanned as usual, and the tag must name a URL.
The bounded allow-list in `portability-guard.config.json` has two
buckets, each entry carrying a mandatory `why`: `exempt` is a permanent per-file cap for text that
is not a portability defect, and `unmigrated` is the sweep floor — one row per sweep unit, and it
only shrinks, so a ceiling left above the count reds exactly as loudly as a new reference does.

Ordered recipes — installing, credentialing, finding a group and a verb, reading a refusal, running
from a consumer repo — are in
[`docs/running-fabrika-in-a-repo.md`](./docs/running-fabrika-in-a-repo.md).

A board-only chore runs through a verb, never through raw `gh`. `fabrika triage sweep-homes` is the
apply side of `guard homing-guard check`: a dry run by default (`--dry-run` says so explicitly), and
`--apply` clears the milestone on each double-marked triaged issue, keeps its standing lane, and
posts one trail comment whose citation is read from stdin. It lists un-homed issues and leaves them
alone, exiting `27`; an empty or unreadable backlog is `7` or `11`, never a clean sweep. Its full
exit table is in `fabrika triage sweep-homes --help` and the
[triage contract](../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/triage/contract.md#triage-sweep-homes).

## Reference

- [`docs/usage-recording.md`](./docs/usage-recording.md) describes the shared host recording API,
  versioned usage envelopes, issue/run model and token summaries, native counter meanings and
  recovery. Claude and Codex totals report their coverage; Pi observation remains unavailable.
- [`docs/verb-reference.md`](./docs/verb-reference.md) orients readers to command groups, retained
  contracts and the `capture` library. Group help lists verbs; each verb's `--help` owns its inputs,
  answer and exit meanings. The help index comes from [`src/registry.ts`](./src/registry.ts).
  [The interface convention](../../claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/interface-convention.md) defines
  the shared calling rules and documentation owners.
- [`docs/packaging.md`](./docs/packaging.md) — which copy of the binary serves an invocation, the
  delegation-outcome table, the environment variables, the two Node floors and the `publishConfig`
  rewrite.
- [`.patterns/fabrika-verb-shape.md`](../../.patterns/fabrika-verb-shape.md) — how a verb module is
  put together and which services it takes.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm --filter @kampus/fabrika-cli test        # vitest
pnpm --filter @kampus/fabrika-cli typecheck   # tsc
pnpm --filter @kampus/fabrika-cli build       # tsc -> dist/, for the published tarball only
```

The development loop has no build step: `bin` points at `./src/bin.ts` and Node ≥ 24 strips the types
natively, so an edit to `src/` is live on the next invocation. `build` emits `dist/` for the
published tarball and nothing else reads it — see
[`docs/packaging.md`](./docs/packaging.md) for the two floors and the `publishConfig` rewrite.
