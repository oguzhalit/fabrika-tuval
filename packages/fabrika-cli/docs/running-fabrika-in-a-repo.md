# Running fabrika in a repo

Recipes for getting `fabrika` installed, credentialed and answering in the repo you are standing in.
Each recipe below is independent — start at the one whose result you want.

Facts about individual verbs — what a group does, what each exit code means — live in the
[verb reference](./verb-reference.md). How the package is published and which copy of the binary
answers is in [packaging](./packaging.md).

## Install the CLI and confirm it runs

1. Install it globally:

   ```bash
   pnpm add --global @kampus/fabrika-cli
   ```

   pnpm 10 skips the package's `postinstall`, which downloads the headless browser `ui render`
   needs, until you approve it. Run `pnpm approve-builds --global` and pick `@kampus/fabrika-cli`.

2. Confirm the binary starts:

   ```bash
   fabrika --version
   ```

   It prints `fabrika v<version>` on stdout and exits `0`. Exit `127` with no `fabrika` line means
   the shell found no binary — the install did not land.

Inside a phoenix checkout you can skip the install and run the working tree directly:

```bash
node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts --version
```

A source run names the commit it runs, so it is never mistaken for the last release:
`fabrika v0.7.1+2b61b57 (source)`, with `-dirty` after the commit when tracked files have
uncommitted changes. The commit is read from the checkout holding the CLI, not from your working
directory. If git is missing or does not answer, it prints the plain `fabrika v<version>`.

## Give it a GitHub credential and confirm a GitHub-touching verb works

1. Put a token in the environment, as `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN`:

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your token>
   ```

   On a developer machine with `gh` already logged in you can skip this step — the credential is
   resolved from that login once at startup. The resolution order and why `gh` is a convenience
   rather than a prerequisite are in
   [ADR 0315](../../../.decisions/0315-fabrika-cli-github-token-resolution-and-the-three-non-rest-carves.md).

2. Run a verb that reads GitHub:

   ```bash
   fabrika status board
   ```

   A working credential prints a scope line on stderr and one `board` row plus one `bucket` row per
   counted bucket on stdout:

   ```text
   status board: scanned 594 items; counted 6 buckets over kamp-us/phoenix, 0 unknown (-).
   board	counted	6
   bucket	needs-triage	3	labels=status:needs-triage	-	2026-08-29T21:41:07Z
   ```

   With no credential anywhere it refuses instead, naming both variables:

   ```text
   no GitHub token — set GITHUB_TOKEN or GH_TOKEN (on a developer machine, `gh auth login` also resolves one)
   ```

## Confirm which copy of the CLI served the invocation

1. From the checkout or worktree in question, re-run any invocation with `FABRIKA_DEBUG=1`:

   ```bash
   FABRIKA_DEBUG=1 fabrika --version
   ```

2. Read the one extra stderr line. It names the copy that served the run — from a phoenix worktree:

   ```text
   fabrika: global at /…/phoenix/packages/fabrika-cli — delegating to the repo-local install at /…/phoenix/.claude/worktrees/agent-1234/packages/fabrika-cli (…/src/bin.ts, v0.5.0)
   ```

   A `running here` line instead means the copy you invoked is the one answering, with no delegation.
   A `refusing` line means the copy lives in a different repository from your working directory, and
   the run exits `126`; pass `--skip-infer` to make that copy serve it anyway. The boundary these
   three lines report is [ADR 0287](../../../.decisions/0287-delegation-stays-inside-one-repository.md).

## Run from a consumer repo that pinned a version

1. Add the CLI to that repo and install it:

   ```bash
   pnpm add --save-dev @kampus/fabrika-cli
   ```

   pnpm 10 skips the package's `postinstall`, which downloads the headless browser `ui render`
   needs, until you approve it. Run `pnpm approve-builds` and pick `@kampus/fabrika-cli`, or add it
   to `onlyBuiltDependencies` and run `pnpm rebuild @kampus/fabrika-cli`.

   From then on `fabrika` inside that repo runs the pinned copy, not the global.

2. If you meant to run the global — the repo has no install yet, or you are deliberately on a newer
   copy — the run warns on stderr and names both versions:

   ```text
   fabrika: running the GLOBAL install (v0.5.0) — /…/consumer has no local install.
     /…/consumer/package.json declares @kampus/fabrika-cli ^0.4.0; install it to run the version this repo pins.
     Silence this with FABRIKA_GLOBAL_WARNING_DISABLED=1.
   ```

3. When running the global is what you want, silence the warning for that invocation:

   ```bash
   FABRIKA_GLOBAL_WARNING_DISABLED=1 fabrika status board
   ```

## Find a group and a verb without reading source

1. List the registered groups:

   ```bash
   fabrika --help
   ```

2. List one group's verbs, each with a one-line description:

   ```bash
   fabrika adr --help
   ```

3. Read one verb's flags, its exit codes and a worked example:

   ```bash
   fabrika adr next --help
   ```

   Its `DESCRIPTION` block carries the exit codes that verb can produce and an `Example:` line you
   can run as written.

## Read a refusal

1. Check the exit status before reading any output:

   ```bash
   fabrika adr next --dir .decisions-nope
   echo $?
   ```

   ```text
   adr next: cannot read .decisions-nope at origin/main: fatal: Not a valid object name … — the merged set is UNKNOWN, never "0 records".
   11
   ```

2. Look `11` up in the [verb reference](./verb-reference.md) — its shared exit table covers `3`–`11`, and
   each group's own section lists the codes that group adds on top.

3. Take the non-zero exit as UNKNOWN and re-run or stop. Do not read the empty stdout as "nothing
   found": a verb that found nothing prints a token for it, as `absent` at exit `0`.
