# The fabrika verb reference

This page orients readers to each command group. The complete verb list comes from runtime help,
which reads the same registry that dispatches commands.

```bash
node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts --help
node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts ship --help
node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts ship checks --help
```

Use group help to choose a verb, then that verb's help for invocation, inputs, answer bytes and exit
meanings. Prefix the short commands below with `node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts`, as above.
The group sections below link to implementation contracts where one exists. Read a
contract by heading:

```bash
node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts wire doc-section --heading 'ship checks' < claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/ship/contract.md
```

The package front door is [the README](../README.md). For what Fabrika is and how to run it, read
[the guide](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/guide/README.md).

## The interface every verb meets

The [interface convention](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/interface-convention.md) owns the
shared calling rules.
[Command documentation ownership](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/interface-convention.md#command-documentation-ownership)
defines what belongs in help, contracts, skills and this reference.

## The shared exit table

Read the command's own `--help` for the codes it can return. The
[exit-status convention](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/interface-convention.md#3-the-exit-status-is-the-answer-empty-stdout-never-is)
explains reserved codes and how groups allocate their own meanings.

## The `adr` group

Record an architecture decision, from allocating its number to resolving citations and updating
older records' status. Use `adr --help` for the verbs and the
[ADR contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/adr/contract.md) for implementation requirements.

## The `build` group

Construct one issue or repair an existing PR. This group owns claims, worktree proofs, branches,
validation and guarded publication. Use `build --help` and the
[build contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/build/contract.md).

For cleanup, `build retire` addresses one issue's held worktree, `build reap` scans finished agent
worktrees, and `build retire-branch` handles an epic child's superseded branches. Read each verb's
help before selecting which work to retire.

## The `campaign` group

Read and change the roadmap's campaign table. Use `campaign --help` and the
[campaign contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/campaign/contract.md).

## The `ci` group

Release and build workflow plumbing: changelog derivation, release-PR bodies and typecheck
annotations. Use `ci --help`.

`ci annotate` is a streaming filter, so its implementation writes its own streams. The
[ci-required entrypoint](../src/ci/required-bin.ts) is a separate dependency-free binary used by the
workflow aggregator. It does not run through the Effect command tree.

## The `config` group

Keep the editor's JSON Schemas for `.fabrika.jsonc` and `.fabrika.local.jsonc` aligned with the
[config-key registry](../src/config/registry.ts). Use `config --help`.

**The config surface is two layers.** The tracked `.fabrika.jsonc` at the repository root is what
the repository declares. Beside it, the gitignored `.fabrika.local.jsonc` is what one machine
declares, and it wins **per key** — the winning value replaces the losing one whole, with no deep
merge and no array concatenation. A key absent from the local file falls to the tracked one, and a
key absent from both falls to its shipped default.

Only an **allow-listed** key may be declared locally, and the allow-list lives in code as the
`machineLocal` field a key group declares beside its own default and decoder. It is
`laneConcurrencyCap` and nothing else: a seat count is a property of the laptop holding the seats,
where a key naming who may act, a key naming a gate's scope or its exemptions, and a key naming a
command fabrika spawns are permanently barred. A local file naming any other key **refuses the whole
load**, naming the key — it is never ignored, because an operator left believing a value is in force
that is not is the failure the refusal exists for. An unreadable local file, or one that is not a
JSON object, resolves every key UNKNOWN rather than falling through to the tracked value. The local
layer is read from the **working tree only**: `build clearances` and every other `readFileAtRef`
caller sees the tracked file alone, so no gate's verdict is reachable from a file no reviewer sees.
A driver declaring a machine cap writes `laneConcurrencyCap` into `.fabrika.local.jsonc`, never
into the tracked file; `status settings` names which file each value came from
(ADR [0398](../../../.decisions/0398-machine-local-config-layer.md)).

## The `decision` group

Record a ruling on a decision issue and read whether it still applies to the issue's text.
Use `decision --help`. The
[approval formats](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/wire-formats.md) describe the stored agreement.

## The `glossary` group

Maintain a repository's domain and architecture vocabulary registers. Use `glossary --help` and
the [glossary contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/glossary/contract.md).

## The `governance` group

Read decision records and changed guard instructions for a PR or commit range, then record the
reviewer's judgment. Use `governance --help` and the
[governance contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/governance/contract.md).

## The `graduate` group

Turn a cleared decision trail into one buildable issue. Use `graduate --help` and the
[graduate contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/graduate/contract.md).

## The `grill` group

Keep questions, answers and founder rulings in a session issue's comments. Use `grill --help` and
the [grilling contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/grilling/contract.md).

## The `guard` group

Repository checks used by CI. This group nests each check under its own command, so discovery has
one more level:

```bash
node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts guard --help
node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts guard readme-guard --help
node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts guard readme-guard check --help
```

What each guard judges, how it scopes itself and why it exists is the
[guard contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/guard-contract.md).
Shared implementations resolve [workspace members](../src/guard/members.ts),
[changed files](../src/guard/changed-files.ts) and [verdicts](../src/guard/verdict.ts).

## The `handoff` group

Record work so another session can resume it. The caller writes the explanation; the command
captures the Git and board state. Use `handoff --help` and the
[handoff contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/handoff/contract.md).

## The `heal-ci` group

Diagnose stalled PRs, read failed-job logs and apply the supported retry. Use `heal-ci --help`
and the [heal-ci contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/heal-ci/contract.md).

## The `hook` group

Read Claude Code hook envelopes and provision worktrees. Use `hook --help` and the
[hook convention](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/hook-surface.md).

Captured envelopes and their capture methods live under
[hook fixtures](../src/hook/__fixtures__/). Repository-specific worktree provisioning is declared
by the consuming repository; the plugin's [hook declarations](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/hooks.json)
are a separate installation concern.

Model-selection history is recorded in the
[retirement decision](../../../.decisions/0374-retire-unused-model-vocabulary.md).

## The `lane` group

Drive a workflow from its local event log. Each command replays the log; lane state stays local and
uncommitted. Use `lane --help` for command details and the
[operator skill](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/operate/SKILL.md) for the driving loop.
[The lane contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/operate/contract.md) holds the
derivation behind each verb whose help points to it.
[Codex dispatch](./codex-dispatch.md) documents running a task in its dedicated worktree.
The close/reopen deployment failure behind `lane retrigger` is recorded in
[the incident report](https://github.com/kamp-us/phoenix/issues/8881).

A template can also be inspected without opening a live issue lane:

```bash
mkdir -p .fabrika/lanes/5673
cp packages/fabrika-cli/src/lane/templates/coder.workflow.json .fabrika/lanes/5673/workflow.json
node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts lane transition 5673 WIP
node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts lane status 5673
```

The [coder template](../src/lane/templates/coder.workflow.json) declares the workflow.
Use `lane print --help` to inspect its compiled transitions.

## The `ledger` group

Write an epic's plan, children and dependency edges. Use `ledger --help` and the
[plan-epic contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/plan-epic/contract.md).
The `plan` group handles the plan's checks.

## The `map` group

Track an undecided destination through a map issue, its question tickets and their native
dependency edges. Use `map --help` and the
[wayfinding contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/wayfinding/contract.md).

## The `pattern` group

Read and update the repository's pattern library. Use `pattern --help` and the
[write-pattern contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/write-pattern/contract.md).
The read verbs inspect a fetched base; the authoring verbs write the current working tree.

## The `plan` group

Check an epic plan and admit its children for construction. Use `plan --help` and the
[plan-gate contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/check-epic-plan/contract.md).

## The `recipe` group

Apply the supported driver repairs and map their results to workflow events. Use `recipe --help`
for command details and the [operator skill](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/operate/SKILL.md)
for when to apply a recipe.

## The `report` group

File an observation for later triage, check for an existing report, or append to one. Use
`report --help` and the [report contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/report/contract.md).

## The `review` group

Read a text change and its acceptance criteria, then post a judgment tied to that version.
Use `review --help` and the [review contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/review/contract.md).

## The `review-ui` group

Capture rendered pages and record a visual judgment tied to the PR's version. Use `review-ui --help`
and the [review-ui contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/review-ui/contract.md).

## The `ship` group

Read merge requirements and drive an approved PR through landing. Use `ship --help` and the
[ship contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/ship/contract.md).

For CI results, start with `ship checks --help`. Its contract section explains workflow coverage,
count derivation and waiting behavior; the
[ship skill](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/ship/SKILL.md) owns what to do with the answer.

## The `spend` group

Record and inspect model usage, token counters and coverage. Use `spend --help` and
[usage recording](./usage-recording.md) for host support, recovery and summary fields.
Historical spend remains separately identified in the same commands.

## The `spike` group

Run throwaway code to answer one empirical question and preserve the result before disposing of
the workspace. Use `spike --help` and the
[prototyping contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/prototyping/contract.md).

## The `status` group

Read the board, settings and installed skill roster for a new session. Use `status --help` and the
[front-door contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/front-door/contract.md).

## The `table` group

Set up the repository's weekly betting table on GitHub Projects (v2), fill its columns from lane
records, read the flags that bring work back to it, and prepare each table's agenda, including the
checks that bring shipped bets back with their evidence. A `boards` block adds an on-call board,
which setup creates, route fills and flags reads. A `digest` block lets `table digest` post the
issues past their response target to a Slack or Discord webhook from a scheduled run. Use
`table --help`, `table setup --help`, `table sync --help`, `table flags --help`,
`table prep --help`, `table route --help`, `table migrate-week --help` and `table digest --help`.
The token needs the `project` scope, except for `table digest` reporting the triage queue alone; the
[adopter guide](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/guide/adopt-fabrika-in-a-new-repo.md#11-set-up-the-betting-table)
covers the scope and the three manual steps setup prints.

## The `triage` group

Turn an intake issue into work with a clear scope, home and audience. Use `triage --help` and the
[triage contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/triage/contract.md).

For an existing acceptance-criteria block with a damaged heading or list shape, see
`triage repair-criteria --help`. Content changes belong to the triage authoring flow.

To fix what `guard homing-guard check` reports, see `triage sweep-homes --help`. It clears a
double-marked issue's milestone and leaves un-homed issues to triage.

## The `ui` group

Read design rules, capture a local build and compare it with a golden image. Use `ui --help` and
the [build-ui contract](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/build-ui/contract.md).
Construction claims and branches remain the `build` group's responsibility.

The [browser provisioner](../scripts/provision-browser.mjs) runs during installation.
For a managed browser installation or a skipped install step, `ui render --help` is the caller's
starting point; an unavailable browser is diagnosed by the capture command.

## The `wire` group

Compose and read the stored text formats commands share. Use `wire --help` and the
[format reference](../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/wire-formats.md).
The [registry](../src/wire/registry.ts) owns the format list; each format module owns its parsing
and serialization rules.

The acceptance-criteria writer can feed its checker directly:

```bash
printf 'the read is total\n[x] the registry is the seam\n' \
  | node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts wire emit --format acceptance-criteria \
  | node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts wire check --format acceptance-criteria
```

## The capture machinery

A library subpath, `@kampus/fabrika-cli/capture`, used by `ui` and `review-ui` for screenshots,
golden images and image comparisons. Its [own README](../src/capture/README.md) documents the library.

```ts
import {captureAndUpload, diffRasters, loadGoldenPointer} from "@kampus/fabrika-cli/capture";
```

Golden images and their storage credentials belong to the consuming repository.
Storage is injected through `StoreLeg`; the package ships the capture code.
Installing the package also installs `@playwright/test`; browser provisioning is described under
[the ui group](#the-ui-group).
