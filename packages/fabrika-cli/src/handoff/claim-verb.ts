/**
 * `handoff claim` — claim the latest sealed pack, keyed on the run nonce.
 *
 * A compare-and-set on a marker; *whether to take up the work* is the caller's. Re-running with the
 * nonce that already holds the pack is `resumed`, not an error, and posts no second comment: a
 * stateless re-dispatch of the same run must be able to prove it still owns the pack.
 *
 * **This verb does not re-derive the ground state and does not report drift.** That is `read`'s, and
 * duplicating it here would be a second answer to one question.
