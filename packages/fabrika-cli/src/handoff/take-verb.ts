/**
 * `handoff take` — compose the pack by value, leak-scan it, post it as one comment, read it back.
 *
 * The compose, the scan, the reachability guard, the post and the read-back are mechanical; *what to
 * say in the four sections* is irreducibly the model's. The caller supplies only the asserted half,
 * on stdin: a caller-supplied ground state would be exactly the premise-inheritance the two-half
 * split exists to prevent, and a body passed as a file reference is how a machine-local path reaches
 * a posted artifact, so there is no `--body` and no `--body-file`.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: UNREACHABLE-WORK-IS-REFUSED --> **Unreachability refuses rather than warns.** A
 * successor is a fresh session in a different checkout: an unpushed commit and a modified tracked file
 * are both literally invisible to it, so a pack whose `## Next act` points at work in that state is
 * confidently wrong. The remedy is the caller's, outside this group, which commits and pushes
 * nothing; the refusal names it. `--declare-unreachable` does not silence the fact — the proven half
 * records `reachable` and the counts verbatim, so the successor reads a **stated** loss.
 *
 * A pack is posted as one comment. See `handoff take --help` for write and read-back refusals.
