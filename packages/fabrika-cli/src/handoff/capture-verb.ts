/**
 * `handoff capture` — derive the ground state as one JSON object, and write nothing.
 *
 * Every field is a total function of the git repository and the board; *what any of it means for the
 * work* is the caller's. That is what makes it safe for a successor to re-run against a pack it has
 * not yet decided to trust.
 *
 * **There is no empty answer.** A repository always has a git state and an issue always has a state,
 * so this verb either produces the object or refuses. `board.pull` being `null` is a **fact** (no
 * pull request has this head ref), not an absence, and so is `git.upstream` being `null`.
