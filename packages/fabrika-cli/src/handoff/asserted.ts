/**
 * The asserted half a caller supplies on stdin: exactly four sections, in order, each non-empty.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: THE-SECTION-SET-IS-CLOSED --> **Content outside those headings is refused, not
 * ignored.** A fifth heading or prose before the first one is the injection this format defends
 * against: an open section set lets an author append a paragraph a successor reads as part of the
 * format, and the successor has no way to tell the format's own words from someone else's.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: UNSURE-IS-NEVER-SILENT --> **An empty section is a refusal.** A section skipped and a
 * section with nothing to say are the same bytes and opposite facts, so the format refuses to
 * represent the ambiguity; `## Unsure` is the row this exists for — a successor reads an empty
 * `Unsure` as certainty.
 *
 * The caller supplies only these four. The proven half is appended by the verb from its own fresh
 * capture, because a caller-supplied ground state would be exactly the premise-inheritance the
 * two-half split exists to prevent: a brief written on what the dispatcher said rather than on what
 * the ground says.
