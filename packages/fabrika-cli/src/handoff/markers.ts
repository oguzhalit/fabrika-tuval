/**
 * The claim marker this group writes, and the pack marker it re-exports.
 *
 * The pack's marker is a **registered wire format**, so its grammar lives in
 * `../wire/handoff-pack.ts` and is only re-exported here. The claim is internal to this group —
 * nothing outside it reads one — and a format nobody meets through is not a wire format.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: CLAIM-KEY-IS-THE-RUN-NONCE --> The claim key is the caller's run nonce, never a
 * session id and never a pid: the session id is pane-constant rather than per-run, and sibling
 * subagents of one parent share it, so two successors booted from one parent would key onto one
 * namespace and each would classify the other's claim as its own. Nothing here reads the
 * environment — the nonce arrives as an argument.
 *
 * **These are the group's own grammar, not `../build/claim.ts`'s.** That module's `composeMarker`
 * hardcodes the `build-claim:` prefix, its `MARKER_RE` matches only that, and its `resolveOwnership`
 * compares a **session** token, so `markersIn` would find zero markers on a pack and every claim
 * would read as unclaimed.
