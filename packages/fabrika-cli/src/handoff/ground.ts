/**
 * The ground state a pack embeds: nineteen digested fields derived from the git repository and the
 * board, plus the two undigested ones (`capturedAt`, `groundDigest`).
 *
 * <!-- anchor: A-FAILED-READ-IS-NEVER-A-VALUE --> **No field carries `unknown` to mean "the read
 * failed".** A git or board read that fails is a refusal for the whole verb — the ground is UNKNOWN
 * and no object is emitted. The one `unknown` in the set, `git.reachable`, is a **fact** about a
 * repository with no configured upstream, and `aheadBy` / `behindBy` are `null` in the same case for
 * the same reason. Conflating the two is how a guard vouches for a tree it never read.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: THE-GROUND-EXCLUDES-WHAT-THIS-GROUP-WRITES --> The digested set excludes exactly the
 * fields this group's own writes move, and nothing more: the pack and the claim are comments, so
 * what a write of ours could move is the issue's `updated_at`, its comment count and its comment
 * ids — none of which is one of the nineteen. `capturedAt` is excluded for a different reason: it
 * differs on every derivation by construction, so digesting it would make drift permanently `moved`.
 *
 * The compared set is **sixteen** of the nineteen. Rows 11-13, the `git.tree.*` fields, are a
 * property of the working copy that took the pack rather than of the work, and no successor can
 * observe them — so they are digested (the pack attests the tree it was taken from) and not
 * compared.
