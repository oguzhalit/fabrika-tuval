/**
 * `handoff read` — resolve the latest sealed pack, parse it into its two halves, re-derive the
 * ground now, and report the drift field by field.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: DRIFT-IS-NEVER-OPTIONAL --> **There is no way to read a pack without its drift.** The
 * two were one verb from the start, because a caller who could skip the second call would sometimes
 * skip it, and a pack read as current while stale is the failure this whole group is built against.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: WHY-NO-PACK-IS-0-ON-READ-AND-13-ON-CLAIM --> Zero packs on an issue is a **fact** —
 * most issues have none — so it is the `none` token at exit `0`, and a successor branches on the
 * token. `claim` refuses `13` on the same fact because it *acts*: asking to claim a pack that does
 * not exist is a request that cannot be honoured. Seating this answer on `13` would hand a booting
 * successor empty stdout on the ordinary case.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: ONE-SUMMARY-NOT-TWO --> `ground` carries only `packed`, the digest the pack attested
 * at seal time, and there is deliberately no `live` counterpart: a live digest over the nineteen
 * would fold in the successor's own working copy, and over the sixteen it is not comparable to
 * `packed` at all. Two top-level summaries that can disagree, with nothing saying which wins, is
 * worse than one.
