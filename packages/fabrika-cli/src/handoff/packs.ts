/**
 * How an issue's comments resolve to **the latest sealed pack**, and to whoever holds its claim.
 *
 * One reader, shared by `handoff read` and `handoff claim`, because the two must not disagree: were
 * only `read` to apply the ACL, an unauthorized newest pack would have `read` honour one comment and
 * `claim` target another — in the very sequence the skill mandates.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: A-MALFORMED-LATEST-PACK-REFUSES --> **A malformed pack is a refusal and never
 * `none`, and never a `disregarded` row.** Reporting `none` over a pack that exists tells a
 * successor nobody handed off, and it starts the work over. The scope is the **latest**
 * marker-bearing pack specifically — falling back to an older one would hand a successor a stale
 * pack believing it current.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: THE-DIGEST-IS-RECHECKED-ON-READ --> The packed digest is **recomputed** from the
 * nineteen fields parsed out of the proven half and compared against both printed copies, the
 * marker's and the JSON's. Without it the digest is decorative on the read path: a pack comment is
 * editable by its author and by anyone with write access, so two copies of a number nobody
 * recomputes can drift with nothing marking it.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: THE-AUTHOR-IS-RESOLVED-NOT-TRUSTED --> A pack's author is resolved against repository
 * permissions before the pack is honoured. A comment carrying a well-formed marker is still a
 * comment anyone with a GitHub account can post, and its `## Next act` is a sentence a successor
 * reads and then acts on. A permission read that **fails** is UNKNOWN for the whole call, never a
 * grant.
 *
 * **Zero packs is a fact; a comment read that could not complete is not.** Most issues carry no
 * pack, and that is the ordinary state — but a page that could not be fetched leaves the answer
 * UNKNOWN, never `none`.
