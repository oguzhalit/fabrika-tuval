/**
 * How another group's verb outcome is re-seated on this group's table.
 *
 * A recipe verb relays: it reads a lane through `lane status`, records the clear through
 * `lane transition`, and asks `ship cp-approval` whether a §CP park's cause is gone (the verb
 * answers, the caller relays, neither derives a decision it does not own). Those verbs answer
 * on **their** tables, and two of `lane`'s private codes sit on numbers this group spells
 * differently, so passing an exit through unchanged would report a refused event as a novel park.
 *
 * The mapping therefore imports both tables and is a pure function, so a re-seat on either side is a
 * type-level fact rather than a number two files agree about by luck.
