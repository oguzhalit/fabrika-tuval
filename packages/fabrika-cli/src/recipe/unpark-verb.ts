/**
 * `recipe unpark` — clear one parked lane when the park's cause is a known recipe, and refuse
 * without touching anything when it is not.
 *
 * The order is the contract, and every step is somebody else's answer relayed:
 *
 *   1. `lane status` folds the ledger — this verb never re-folds a log.
 *   2. {@link classifyPark} seats the leaf, and the cause the parking event named, against the
 *      recipe table — a `blocked` carrying no cause keys on nothing. **A founder-routed novel park
 *      refuses here**, before any read that could write and long before the append, which is what
 *      makes the novel exit a proven no-op rather than a claim about one.
 *   3. The recipe's clearance is read from the verb that owns it — `ship cp-approval`'s own
 *      discharge table, never a second reading of §CP in this file; `ship checks`, `ship scope` and
 *      `ship gate` for the shipper's red-CI row, which is the shipper's own floor taken again rather
 *      than a rival reading of it, and the first two alone for the reviewer's. A driver-routed park
 *      with no
 *      recipe has no such read, and clears on the driver's rationale instead.
 *   4. `lane transition … UNBLOCKED` records the clear, carrying that rationale where there is one.
 *      The one exception is a red head `heal-ci` classes a defect: no wait clears that, so it is
 *      recorded as the park's `FAIL` into repair instead.
 *   5. `lane status` is folded **again**, and the answer is emitted only once that re-fold shows the
 *      task out of the park: no recipe reports a mutation it did not read back.
 *
 * **Whose park it is comes off the cause, never off a judgment made here.** Every park cause carries
 * a route (`lane/report.ts`), and `driver` means the park is machinery a driver session may work
 * itself. Under `.fabrika.jsonc`'s `parkCause.driverRouted: "clear"` that is what happens, and the
 * price is a `--rationale` on the recorded line — a clearance nothing records is one nobody can
 * review, so the verb refuses rather than take it silently. A `founder` route reaches none of this:
 * it behaves exactly as it did before the flag existed.
 *
 * Respawning whatever the lane parked out of is the operator's, not this verb's.

 * Read whether the spawn-dead park's cause is gone: the shell the provider killed left nothing

 * It proves a dispatch is possible, never that the provider is back — no verb can spawn an agent, so
 * the operator's next dispatch is that test and a still-down provider re-parks the lane. The two
 * halves are residue the driver session owns: a build claim the dead shell stranded, and a working
 * tree still holding its lane branch, which the row's `build retire` remedy takes back where a
 * license reaches it.
 *
 * **The stranded claim is retracted here, on proof rather than on absence** — and this row is the
 * only place the claim protocol allows a claim to *end* on its age. The park it ends inside no longer
 * has to be a driver's: `lane recover --spawns` may record the same park on a strict residue
 * conjunction, and it retracts nothing, so the age read now reaches two callers while the retraction
 * still reaches one. There is no heartbeat,
 * so what proves the shell dead is its claim outliving the budget for the kind of work it took
 * (`../lane/shell-budget.ts`), and {@link reclaimDeadClaim} retracts it and re-reads the board to
 * prove it gone. A claim still inside its budget is a shell that may be working, so the park holds;
 * a retraction the re-read does not confirm is a read-back mismatch, never a clear. That is what
 * ends the hand `build adopt` + `build release` this row used to require of a person for a failure
 * nobody chose.
 *
 * A lane carrying no branch for the issue clears on the claim read alone, and that holds for all
 * three shell roles rather than only the two that cut nothing. A dead reviewer or shipper never cut
 * a branch, so "no branch here" is their ordinary case rather than `branch-free`'s wrong clone. A
 * dead builder did cut one, and never pushed it — but it was cut in a worktree of this clone, whose
 * branch refs live in the shared common git dir, so {@link localBranches} lists it here
 * (`.patterns/worktree-agent-constraints.md`; the same sharing `build branch --resume-lane` reads a
 * missing branch as gone rather than elsewhere on). That containment holds only while the unpark runs
 * in the clone that spawned the shell — which is the clone the lane ledger lives in, and nothing
 * enforces it: run this from another clone and a dead builder's zero reads as free, where

 * Decide whether a red head is a defect this lane repairs, or a red the park keeps waiting out.

 * arm, the same guarded pair `ship` walks, so an exhausted budget falls to its park.
 *
 * Everything short of a `logic` context holds the park exactly as the red did before this arm
 * existed: an all-`transient` or `unclassified` red, and a log that could not be read or classified,
 * which is a red nobody has classified yet. So does a `logic` red on a PR the pipeline does not own,
 * because that repair is its author's (`heal-ci` §2's ownership rule, read through the same gate
 * `build claim` puts in front of a repair). And so does every red on a lane whose own machine gives
 * the park no `FAIL` arm, read before any log: a coder lane booted on a template older than the arm,
 * or an epic lane emitted before its tail's park carried one — a generated machine is never
