/**
 * `--help` is the recipe adapter's public contract. `unpark` is the one verb here that takes a lanes
 * root, and it must tell the same derivation story `lane`'s flag tells — a flag advertising a bare
 * cwd-relative default is how an operator learns the wrong resolution rule.
 *
 * The derivation behind each exit lives in the operate skill's `contract.md`, which help points at;
 * the assertions on that derivation read it there.
