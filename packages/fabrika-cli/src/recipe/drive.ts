/**
 * The chore drive's two closed tables: which recipe verb a chore state applies, and which one of the
 * machine's operator events a run's exit records.
 *
 * This is `relay.ts`'s sibling one level up. `relay.ts` re-seats another *verb's* exit on this
 * group's table; this module re-seats this group's exit on the *machine's* event vocabulary — the
 * same discipline, because the operator that routes a chore lane holds no recipe knowledge and must
 * not compose one. Both halves are data with a pure reader, so `operate`'s chore drive relays an
 * answer it does not derive, rather than restating a table in prose that drifts from the exits it
 * describes.
 *
 * **Every exit lands on exactly one event.** A code with no row is `BLOCKED` and says so — the same
 * refusal-shaped default `relay.ts` takes, for the same reason: an exit this table has no reading
 * for has proven nothing, and the permissive reading of a code nobody seated is how a chore comes to
 * report a fix it never applied. `PARK_NOVEL` is the seat the known/novel split sits on: it folds to
 * `BLOCKED`, which every chore machine routes to a `human:` park, so novel reaches a human by the
 * machine's own cell rather than by an operator deciding to escalate.
