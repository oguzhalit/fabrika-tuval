/**
 * `recipe rerun` — rerun a driver PR's failed workflow runs, and only behind a `governance` PASS at
 * the PR's live head.
 *
 * The gate is read first and the rerun is the only write, in that order: a verdict that is absent,
 * bound to another head, or FAIL refuses before anything is posted, so a refusal here is a proven
 * no-op. The three refusals stay three codes because their remedies are opposite — form a verdict,
 * re-form it at this head, or repair the PR — and folding any two is how a stale PASS comes to
 * authorise a rerun at a head nobody judged.
 *
 * Each rerun is proven by re-reading its own run record, never by the POST's status
 * ([`github.ts`](./github.ts)). A run whose re-read shows no new attempt is a mismatch, not a
 * success with a caveat.
