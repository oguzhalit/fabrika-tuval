/**
 * `recipe route` — what a chore drive does at one chore-lane state, before and after the run.
 *
 * One question asked twice. Without `--exit` the answer is which recipe verb the state applies and
 * what that verb is pointed at; with `--exit` it is the single machine event that run's outcome
 * records. Both halves come off [`drive.ts`](./drive.ts)'s tables, so `operate`'s chore drive relays
 * an answer this package owns instead of carrying a routing table in prose — a prose copy
 * of an exit table is a copy that drifts from the exits the moment either verb grows a code.
