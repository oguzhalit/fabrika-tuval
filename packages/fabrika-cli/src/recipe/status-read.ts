/**
 * Reading one task's leaf state out of `lane status`'s answer.
 *
 * The recipe verb relays the lane's own fold rather than re-folding the log itself, so
 * what it holds is the status verb's stdout — a `stateValue` that is either a bare terminal name or
 * `{phase: {task: leaf}}` with future phases as the string `"waiting"`. Turning that back into one
 * task's leaf is the only derivation this file does, and it is pure so the ambiguity cases are
 * testable without a lane on disk.
 *
 * A finished workflow answers {@link Finished} rather than a leaf: a terminal is not a park, and
 * inventing a leaf for it is how a completed lane would read as clearable.
