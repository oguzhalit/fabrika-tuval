/**
 * The known-park recipe table — which parks a recipe verb may clear on its own, as data.
 *
 * Every entry names a park's leaf state, the one read that proves the park's cause is gone, and the
 * sentence a refusal quotes. Nothing here is derived at run time: a verb relays a decision already
 * written down rather than computing one, so the set of parks that clear autonomously is a literal
 * in this file and the known/novel split — known clears, novel routes to a human — is the shape of
 * {@link classifyPark}'s result rather than a sentence in an operator's prompt.
 *
 * The parks themselves come from the lane machine, not from here: `blocked` and every `human:*`
 * state is a park (`lane/templates/coder.workflow.json`, and `operate` §4's routing table). A park
 * with no row below is **novel** — which is a decision this table records, not one a verb makes.
 *
 * A row keys on the leaf **and** the park cause the parking event named
 * ([`lane/report.ts`](../lane/report.ts)'s closed set). The leaf alone was never enough for
 * `blocked`, which thirteen distinct shell terminals fold into: it says a park happened and not why,
 * so every `blocked` was novel by construction and no row for one could be written at all.
 *
 * The pairing binds one direction: every row keys on a real cause, and a cause is free to stand with
 * no row here. A row is what buys a park an autonomous clear; it is not the price of naming why the
 * lane parked. This table is priced at a proving read; naming a park is not.

/**
 * The parks with a fixed fix today: one keyed by its leaf, twelve by their cause.
 *
 * `human:cp-approval` + `awaiting-cp-approval`'s clearance is `ship cp-approval`'s own discharge
 * table, relayed rather than re-derived — the §CP cardinality question has exactly one answer in this
 * package, and a second reading of it here would drift from that one. `blocked` + `worktree-holds-branch`'s clearance is
 * the inverse of the very read that refuses the build: `build branch --resume-lane` refuses while a
 * working tree holds the child's lane branch, so the park is clear exactly when no working tree holds
 * it — and the clearance first runs `build retire`, which takes that checkout back where a license
 * reaches it: a written positive board state, or, on the lane no claim marker holds any more, proof
 * the tree carries nothing. Without the remedy the row read the pin and could never remove it, so
 * every lane parked on this cause sat at exit 13 until a human ran `git worktree remove` by hand.
 *
 * `blocked` + `campaign-paused` is a park nothing records any more — no campaign state gates a lane —
 * kept so a lane parked on it earlier still clears. Its clearance reads the lane milestone's
 * `## Campaigns` `State` cell at the trunk and clears on `active`. It names no remedy because
 * resuming a campaign is a human's judgment recorded through `campaign state`.
 *
 * `blocked` + `spawn-dead` is the one row whose clearance reads the lane rather than the cause
 * itself: no verb can spawn an agent to find out whether the provider is back, so the operator's next
 * dispatch is that test and this row proves only that the dispatch can happen — no claim of the dead
 * shell's is standing, and no working tree still holds its lane branch. Both are residue the driver
 * session owns, so a park whose obligations were discharged clears on the first pass and one whose
 * stranded claim still needs a successor's `build adopt` marker holds at exit 13.
 *
 * `blocked` + `tree-hijacked` asks what `spawn-clear` asks — no claim standing and no tree holding
 * this lane's branch — through `tree-released`, which never ends a claim. The age-proved
 * retraction is `spawn-dead`'s alone (`../build/dead-claim.ts`), and a builder that stopped on a
 * hijacked tree released its own claim before it reported, so a claim still standing is some live
 * shell's and holds the park.
 *
 * `blocked` + `claim-stranded` is the claim half of that read on its own: `claim-released` clears
 * only when no build claim stands on the issue or on any open PR linking it — a repair claim sits on
 * the PR — and it retracts nothing on any arm, age included. The claimant is a shell of the driver's
 * own session, which `build adopt` refuses, so releasing it under its token is the driver's act.
 *
 * `human:queue-stall` is the one row keyed by its leaf alone: a `WIP` carries no park cause and
 * `lane report` refuses one on any non-`BLOCKED` event, so the leaf is all there is to key on. Its clearance
 * is `ship reconcile`'s answer relayed — no verb in this tree can read the queue's own position, so
 * the row turns on the two outcomes that already exist, `landed` and `ejected`. It names no remedy
 * for the same reason `campaign-active` does not: a recipe that "removed" this cause would be merging
 * the PR. What it does instead is grant: the recipe is the grantor, so the clear and the wait it buys
 * ride one recorded event and there is no bare `UNBLOCKED` into a spent budget for the fold to refuse.
 *
 * `blocked` + `no-rendered-delta` is the row a repaired terminal does not make redundant, and that
 * is the whole reason it exists. `lane report` now advances the terminal when the proof holds
 * ([`lane/report.ts`](../lane/report.ts)'s `PROOF_CONDITIONAL_TERMINALS`), so no *new* lane parks on
 * a complete route — but a lane already sitting on this cause parked before that reading existed,
 * and nothing in the ledger clears itself. Its clearance is the shipper's own floor minus CI, which
 * is the exact read the park's meaning is false about: `ship gate`'s conjunction over `ship scope`'s
 * required set at the live head, with the routed namespace still reading `routed` there. Requiring
 * that last part is what keeps the clear the inverse of *this* cause rather than a generic
 * "everything passed" — a park whose route was withdrawn or re-judged is a different park, and it
 * holds. It names no remedy for `campaign-active`'s reason: dispatching the other gate is the
 * driver's own act, and a recipe that "removed" this cause would be taking it.
 *
 * `human:cp-approval` + `head-ci-red` is the second row on that leaf, and the cause key is what makes
 * two rows there legal: `ship`'s `BLOCKED` folds to `human:cp-approval` whatever the block was, so a
 * shipper that routed to `heal-ci` and one that stopped on a §CP approval land on the same state. The
 * §CP row keys on `awaiting-cp-approval` and this one on `head-ci-red`, so neither can match the
 * other's park, and a `ship` park naming neither — a `REFUSED`, an `UNKNOWN`, a bare `BLOCKED` —
 * matches no row on this leaf at all. Its clearance is the shipper's own step-4 read taken again —
 * `ship checks`'s rollup at the live head — conjoined with the reads that step ran before it, so the
 * clear proves the whole floor the shipper was standing on rather than the one condition that
 * failed. It names no remedy because turning a red head green is repair work, and a recipe that
 * "removed" this cause would be doing it. What its read does instead, on a red `heal-ci` classes a
 * defect, is route that repair: the verb records the park's `FAIL` into `build` rather than holding
 * a park that no wait would ever clear.
 *
 * `blocked` + `head-ci-red` is the same cause met one stage earlier: a reviewer that read the head
 * red and parked rather than judge it. `review`'s `BLOCKED` folds to `blocked`, so the leaf keeps it
 * apart from the shipper's row and the cause keeps it apart from every other `blocked` row. Its
 * clearance, `head-green`, proves less than `ci-green` does, because the reviewer stood on less:
 * `ship scope` for the PR still being open and not a draft, and `ship checks`'s rollup reading
 * `green` at the live head. Those are `ci-green`'s first two reads without its third. `ci-green`
 * also asks `ship gate` for a binding verdict in every derived namespace, and those verdicts are the
 * reviewer's own unfinished work, so asking for them here would hold the park until the very review
 * it stopped. A red holds and never routes to repair: `blocked` carries no `FAIL` arm. It names no
 * remedy for `ci-green`'s reason.
 *
 * `blocked` + `render-axis-missing` is the one row whose read is another issue: the park line names
 * the open issue tracking the render axis the rendered review could not reach (`axisIssue`), and
 * `axis-closed` clears once that issue reads closed. A retry before then re-dispatches `review:ui`
 * into the same gap, which is why this park does not clear on a driver's rationale. It names no
 * remedy: building the axis is that issue's own work.
 *
 * `blocked` + `ruling-owed` reads another issue too, and reads it differently: the park line names
 * the issue a ruling is owed on (`rulingIssue`), and `ruling-made` relays `decision ruling` on it.
 * It clears on a ruling marker dated after the park, in `current` or `stale` — an issue can carry an
 * older ruling when the lane parks, so a marker alone would clear the park the moment it is
 * recorded. It names no remedy: a recipe that "removed" this cause would be making the ruling.
 *
 * `founder-act-owed` has no row, and that is the decision rather than a gap: no read proves a
 * person took a step by hand, so that park leaves on a person's `UNBLOCKED` and nothing else.
