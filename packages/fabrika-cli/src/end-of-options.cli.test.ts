/**
 * The documented `--` separator binds its trailing argv to the leaf verb's declared argument.
 *
 * The vendored parser reset the lexer's post-`--` operands when it recursed into a subcommand, so
 * every token after `--` was bound two levels up and dropped before the leaf's params saw it — a
 * verb following its own help-text example failed with `"0 values"` for an argument the caller did
 * supply, and a verb with optional variadic positionals silently bound zero. The fix lives in
 * Effect rc.112 (`parseArgs` threading `trailingOperands` through the
 * recursion); this file is its behavior pin, in the same register as `excess-operand.cli.test.ts`:
 * only a subprocess proves what a shell caller reads, and each case asserts the **exit code and
 * stderr**, never stdout content that could pass against the bug.
 *
 * Every spawn is offline and deterministic: the verbs are driven to their first post-parse refusal,
 * which is exactly the boundary the fix moves — "the tokens arrived" is proven by which refusal
 * answers.
