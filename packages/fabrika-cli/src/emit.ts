/**
 * Write a verb's outcome to the process streams and exit on its code — stdout is the answer,
 * everything else is stderr.
 *
 * **The exit hangs off the write callbacks, not off the write call returning.** When stdout is a
 * pipe — including the `x=$(fabrika …)` a caller writes without thinking of it as one — the write is
 * asynchronous, and `process.exit` tears the process down without draining what is still queued. So
 * exiting on the line after the write discarded every byte past the pipe buffer, silently and on
 * exit 0, exactly when the answer was long enough for a reader to need all of it.
 *
 * The exit is explicit on every code, 0 included, so the code a verb computed is the code the
 * process returns rather than whatever the runtime would have inferred. `process.exitCode` is set
 * ahead of the writes so a stream that never reports a flush still lands on that same code.
