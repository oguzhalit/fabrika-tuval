/**
 * The two GitHub reads this gate needs that no shipped module already makes, plus the repo-file probe
 * `MISSING_CONTAINMENT` rests on. Everything else is imported (`io/issues.ts`, `build/target.ts`).
 *
 * Both reads keep the package's two standing disciplines, which is why they are here rather than
 * inline in a verb:
 *
 * - **A shape that is not what was asked for is a failure, never an empty result.** A sub-issue list
 *   that decodes to something else fails; it never reads back as "this epic has no children", which
 *   would turn a broken read into a clean zero-scope refusal about a real ledger.
 * - **Absence is decided by HTTP status, never by matching text against an error string.** v1 used
 *   `/404|not found/i.test(stderr)`, which reads an auth-hidden repo as a proven-absent issue. Since
 *   the port off `gh` onto the REST client the status is a number the response carried.
 *
 * The credential is an argument to every leg of the client, so each read resolves one from the `env`
 * its caller hands down — never from `process`, which is what keeps a test's environment scripted.
 *
 * **Why the child read is not `getIssue`.** `IssueRecord` drops the payload's `assignees` key
 * entirely, and the distinction `UNVERIFIABLE_ASSIGNEE` rests on is exactly *the key was not there* —
 * a fact no shape that omits the field can carry. {@link ChildPayload} is that shape: a sibling of
 * `io/issues.ts`'s readers, decoded from the same endpoint, one fetch per child.
