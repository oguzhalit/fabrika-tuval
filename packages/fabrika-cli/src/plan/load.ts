/**
 * The read all four verbs share: the epic precondition, the ledger fetch, and the floor's one probe.
 *
 * `plan check`, `plan flip` and `plan verdict` each re-run this fetch rather than taking a ledger on
 * stdin or trusting an earlier verb's output — a floor that graded a caller-supplied document would
 * grade a document the caller could edit.
 *
 * Every refusal is worded by the calling verb, because the same fact reads differently at each seam:
 * an unreadable child is "the ledger is UNKNOWN" to `plan read` and "nothing was written" to
 * `plan flip`. The codes are identical; only the sentence moves.
