/**
 * The scope digest: the first 12 lowercase hex of the SHA-256 of a canonical serialization of the
 * inputs the floor read.
 *
 * **The flip is digest-neutral by construction, and this file is where that invariant lives.** The
 * only two labels `plan flip` writes — the board's planned and triaged statuses, `status:planned`
 * and `status:triaged` unless the repo renamed them — are excluded from the child serialization, so
 * a digest taken at check time still binds after the flip and a verdict posted afterwards attests
 * the scope the floor actually scanned. Without the exclusion the digest would be invalidated by the
 * very write it guards, and every clean verdict would bind a scope no floor had checked. Neither
 * label is a floor trigger while it sits under `status:`: `MISSING_LABEL` tests that literal prefix,
 * so a pair renamed outside it reds the floor on every child, and `NEEDS_TRIAGE_LABEL` names
 * `status:needs-triage`, which the flip never writes.
 *
 * The digest is threaded explicitly and never remembered: `plan check` prints it, and the two
 * mutating verbs require it as `--digest` and recompute from a fresh read. That is the TOCTOU answer
 * — the gap between deciding and writing is closed by re-deciding, not by trusting a cached decision.
