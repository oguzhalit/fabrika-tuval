/**
 * The floor: a total function from the ledger to a sorted defect list over a closed fifteen-type
 * enum. `plan check` is this function plus a fetch; nothing above it can change the answer.
 *
 * **Two defects are about the *board* rather than the document, and they face opposite ways across
 * the same seam.**
 *
 * `UNENFORCED_DEP` asks whether the graph carries what the prose declares. The native `blocked_by`
 * graph is the only carrier of blockedness, so a plan whose dependency lives in `## Dependencies`
 * alone is a plan whose gates are blind: an epic once admitted a child gated behind an open, unruled
 * decision, because the prose said so and the graph did not. It is what makes "floor clean" mean the
 * graph agrees with the prose; `ledger edges` is the write that clears it.
 *
 * `DROPPED_EPIC_BLOCKER` asks whether the prose declares what the **epic's own** graph carries, and
 * it is why that edge reaches the children at all. An epic takes a `gate` claim while its own
 * blockers are open — the purpose matrix admits it — `plan flip` then makes every child pickable, and
 * a child's build claim reads that child's edges alone, so an external prerequisite recorded only at
 * epic level fences nothing. The corpus's carry-down ruling has the planner write each open target
 * onto every child's refs; this defect is the check half of that ruling, and `plan-epic`'s contract
 * clause is the write half.
 *
 * **Sixteen names, fifteen defects.** `ZERO_SCOPE` is the sixteenth and is seated as exit `7`
 * rather than as defect zero: v1 made a childless epic defect #1 and early-returned, so the ledger
 * was never validated and the verdict reported exactly one thing wrong about a plan it had not read.
 * A refused scope is not a defect list of length one.
 *
 * **A class that cannot be derived is named, never dropped.** `MISSING_CONTAINMENT` rests on a
 * three-valued probe: `present` derives the class, `absent` derives it and evaluates it false, and
 * only `unknown` puts it in {@link Floor.skipped}. v1 fused `absent` and `unknown` through a stderr
 * substring match, so a transient probe failure silently switched the whole class off for a run.
 *
 * The priority set is exactly `{p0, p1, p2}` — `p3` was ruled *retired*, not widened.
