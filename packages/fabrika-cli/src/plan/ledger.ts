/**
 * The ledger grammar this gate reads — the epic's sections and the two per-child field lines.
 *
 * Three defect types and the scope digest all rest on it, and v1's equivalents were silently
 * permissive in ways that changed a plan's meaning without saying so. Three refusals answer three
 * scars, and each is a refusal rather than a first-match win because the alternative is a plan whose
 * meaning depends on ordering nobody stated:
 *
 * - **A section that appears twice is undecidable**, not "read the first one".
 * - **A field line that appears twice is undecidable**, likewise.
 * - **Story ids are the list items' own leading integers**, never their positions, and a non-empty
 *   list must run from 1 with no gaps or repeats — v1 read positions, so a mis-numbered list
 *   silently renumbered every story and the coverage defects then pointed at the wrong ones.
 *
 * **Fenced code blocks are scanned by nothing here.** v1 had no fence awareness anywhere, so a
 * documentation example inside a fence set a real child's data.
 *
 * `## Dependencies` is deliberately absent from this module: it is read through the imported
 * `../build/dependencies.ts` parser, and this spec adds no second grammar for it. The **section
 * boundary** is imported from there for the same reason — a section ends at the next heading of
 * equal or shallower depth, or at the first thematic break, and the two readers would silently
 * disagree about where a ledger's last section ends if each spelled that rule itself.
