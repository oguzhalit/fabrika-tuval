/**
 * `plan read` — fetch the epic and its children, parse the ledger, print it as one object.
 *
 * The fetch and the registered parses, and no judgment: *what the plan is worth* stays in the skill,
 * and *whether it clears the floor* is `plan check`'s. Zero children is a `7` refusal rather than an
 * empty answer — an empty child set is not a clean read of an epic with nothing in it, it is a scope
 * nobody can grade.
