/**
 * `plan verdict` — post the gate's verdict comment, bound to the scope digest, and read it back.
 *
 * **This verb derives its own polarity by re-running the floor.** `--polarity` exists only as a
 * cross-check for an operator driving the verb by hand: when it disagrees with the derived floor the
 * verb refuses on `10` rather than posting either, so the caller's opinion never becomes the posted
 * verdict. A defective floor is not a refusal here — it posts the `FAIL`, which is the deliverable.
 *
 * The verb is the **only** emit path, and it re-reads what it posted: v1 hand-posted a gate verdict at
 * least once and it read as genuine for weeks.
 *
 * **The approval is re-read inside that same re-derive** and refuses on `25` — an
 * unapproved plan gets no verdict at all, not even a `FAIL`, because a posted verdict is the gate
 * saying it ran, and on an unapproved plan the gate is exactly what did not run.
