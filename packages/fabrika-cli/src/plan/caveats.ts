/**
 * The advisory caveats `plan verdict` records beside the verdict — a closed set of kinds, and a
 * model-authored tail.
 *
 * **Caveats annotate; they never block.** There is no code path from a caveat to a polarity, and **no
 * verb reads a caveat back as input** — it is a note for a human, never a signal a lane consumes.
 * That is what makes the free-prose tail a bounded exception to the closed-vocabulary rule rather
 * than a hole in it: the *kind* is closed and checked, the tail is inert.
