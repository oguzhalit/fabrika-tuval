/**
 * `plan flip` — flip every `status:planned` child to `status:triaged` and the epic itself to
 * `ready-for:agent`, re-gating first, and report the **observed** result for each.
 *
 * **The epic's audience flip has exactly one owner, and this verb is it.** Under the single-PR model
 * the operator picks the epic up, so the epic's own audience label is load-bearing; the planner must
 * not write it (an ungated plan would become pickable) and the operator must not write it (it would
 * admit itself). The gate is the only place a clean floor has already been proven. It is written
 * last, after every child is *observed* pickable, so the epic never becomes pickable over a
 * half-flipped ledger.
 *
 * Four guards, each designed against a named v1 failure:
 *
 * 1. **Re-gate.** The founder approval is re-read, the floor re-derived and the digest recomputed
 *    here, not read off a prior verb's exit code. The gap between deciding and writing is closed by
 *    re-deciding — including the human decision, so a lane cannot carry a `plan check` that passed
 *    before a re-plan past this write (`25`).
 * 2. **Vocabulary precondition.** `POST .../labels` *creates* an unknown label rather than rejecting
 *    it, so an absent label would be silently minted. With nothing to write the check is
 *    skipped — a `nothing-to-flip` success must not refuse over a label it was never going to touch.
 * 3. **Add before remove, always.** That order is load-bearing, not stylistic: a child caught between
 *    the two calls carries **both** labels, which still satisfies `MISSING_LABEL`'s "a `status:`
 *    prefix" and neither of which is in the digest. Under the reverse order a child between the calls
 *    carries **no** `status:` label, `MISSING_LABEL` flips true, and `plan verdict` would then
 *    re-derive a defective floor on a run the gate believes clean. A failing child never aborts its
 *    siblings.
 * 4. **Re-read every child.** v1 asserted the flip from its pre-mutation intent list and re-read
 *    nothing, so a child left carrying both labels — the ADD landing and the DELETE failing — was
 *    reported as pickable.
