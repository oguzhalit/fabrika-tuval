/**
 * `plan approve` — record a control-plane human's approval of one epic's plan.
 *
 * **The digest is derived here and taken from nowhere.** There is no `--digest` flag, and adding one
 * would be the defect: an approval whose scope its caller supplies attests whatever the caller
 * pleased, which is precisely the binding the marker exists to be. The verb loads the ledger through
 * the same `loadLedger` path `plan check` runs and takes `scopeDigest`'s answer over it.
 *
 * The roster is resolved at write time through `./approval.ts`, and a roster that could not be read
 * is `11` — never "not approved" and never "approved". That is the collapse `ship cp-approval`
 * already refuses to make, and it is worth more here: this verb's whole output is an authority claim.
