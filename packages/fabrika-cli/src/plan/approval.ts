/**
 * What approval already stands on an epic, and the one gate the three re-deriving verbs enforce it
 * through. Who *may* approve is `../ship/roster.ts` — one ACL read, shared with `decision rule`.
 *
 * **Both sides resolve the roster, because a marker is bytes.** The write resolves it to decide
 * whether this invocation may post, and the read resolves it again to decide whose posted bytes
 * count: posting a `plan-approved:` line takes nothing but the ability to comment on the epic, and
 * the digest it must carry is printed on `plan check`'s stdout. A read honouring the format alone
 * would let any agent token in this pipeline approve a plan, which the approval rule forbids in as
 * many words and which the sibling `../build/clearances.ts` refuses under its clause 2: a committed
 * list with no author gate is exactly the shape an authority check exists to forbid.
