/**
 * The guard over **authored** text — the bytes the caller just wrote — for `review post` and
 * `review append-criterion`.
 *
 * An unread pipe cannot prove empty input. A body that is a path cannot be repaired by
 * rewriting a leaked path inside it, so the two refusals must stay distinct.
 *
 * **The predicates are the shipped `report/leaks.ts` ones, imported.** Only the message text is this
 * group's, because each refusal names one correctable thing in this verb's own words — a verdict body
 * that must *cite* a leak found in the diff cites it by class root or repo-relative form, while an
 * appended criterion is simply rewritten. A second leak predicate that drifts from the first
 * is worse than either alone.
