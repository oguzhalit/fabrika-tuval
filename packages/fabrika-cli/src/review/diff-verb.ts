/**
 * `review diff` — the PR's diff bytes, read out of one commit, with a short read refused rather than
 * silently passed through.
 *
 * This verb is not a relay, and two proofs are why. **Completeness:** a diff carrying fewer files
 * than git lists for the same range is refused, because a gate that judged the visible prefix as the
 * whole PR is the blind-PASS class one layer down; v1's `pr-diff.sh` was the relay, and
 * nothing checked what it served. This is not a guard against a truncating platform: the diff media type refuses an
 * over-limit diff rather than serving a short one, and these bytes never come from it — see
 * `diff.ts` for what the proof does and does not cover. **Provenance:** the bytes come from
 * the object database at the bound commit via `diffRange`, never from an endpoint that takes a PR
 * number and no commit — see `head.ts` for why a SHA on the verdict is not the same thing as bytes
 * from that SHA.
