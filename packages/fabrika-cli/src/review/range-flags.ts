/**
 * The range subject a verb takes instead of a pull request — the flag pair, and the commit it implies.
 *
 * An epic child runs on one shared branch with a single PR at the tail, so mid-run there
 * is no pull request for a verb to resolve. `--base`/`--tip` is the subject that stands in its place,
 * and this module is the one place its shape is read, so `governance post`'s range form and
 * the read verbs that run before it cannot drift apart on what a well-formed range is.
 *
 * **The range's merge base is `git merge-base <base> <tip>`, and that is not a second meaning for the
 * word.** Every range reader already in the tree takes its diff under git's three-dot form —
 * `../io/git.ts`'s `rawDiffArgs` builds `<base>...<tip>` for the `diffRangeRaw` that
 * `./content-binding.ts`'s `rangeContentAt` digests, which is the read `./range-post.ts` delegates a
 * range's content binding to, and `../lane/prove-verb.ts` folds a child's verdict over that same pair
 * — and `<a>...<b>` is by git's definition the diff from
 * `merge-base(a, b)` to `b`. So the commit a PR-scoped read resolves through `./head.ts` and the
 * commit a range implies are the same commit reached two ways. {@link rangeMergeBase} names it
 * explicitly only because reading *bytes* out of a commit needs a name, where diffing a range does not.
