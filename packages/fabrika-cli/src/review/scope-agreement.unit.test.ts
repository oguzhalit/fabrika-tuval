/**
 * `review scope` and `ship scope` over one file list, compared row for row.
 *
 * The two verbs live in different groups, read the changed files off different seams (git for
 * review, the pulls API for ship) and print different surrounding fields, so nothing but a test that
 * runs *both* catches them drifting. While only the ship side derived `ui`, a reviewer on a rendered
 * diff was told `review-code` was the whole bar, PASSed, and `ship gate` then refused a `review-ui`
 * namespace nobody had routed — one wasted ship dispatch and a park per PR.
 *
 * Both read the class config at the PR's head and merge base — review out of git, ship off the
 * platform — so each side is handed the same config at the same two commits here, and neither reads
 * the tree the test stands up.
