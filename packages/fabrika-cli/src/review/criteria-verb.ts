/**
 * `review criteria` — the set a review grades: the linked issue's acceptance-criteria block read
 * through the registered `acceptance-criteria` wire format, **plus** every standing ruling on that
 * issue read through the registered `decision-ruling` one.
 *
 * The verb fetches the body and hands it to the format's own `read`; there is **no second parser**
 * (`../wire/acceptance-criteria.ts`, imported). A drifted heading therefore reds as `Malformed`
 * rather than reading as "there were none" — the wire module's discrimination carried to the fetch
 * seam.
 *
 * **The rulings half is why this verb is the gate's whole contract read**, and the defect it closes
 * is told once, in `./graded-set.ts`. The comments are scanned through `../decision/standing-rulings.ts` — the same
 * roster-gated read `decision ruling` answers from, so an off-roster marker is not a ruling here
 * either — and folded with the body in `./graded-set.ts`, which is the only place the two meet.
 *
 * **An unread ruling scan is `11`, never an empty one.** Reporting "no ruling stands" off a roster
 * that did not resolve is exactly the silent-pass this verb exists to close, one layer down.
 *
 * An issue's open/closed state is deliberately not a precondition, asymmetric with
 * `review append-criterion`: reading the contract off a closed issue is a legitimate re-review case,
 * while writing to one buries the row where nobody looks.
 *
 * **A criterion's outside-diff evidence marker rides the same read.** It is the format's own field,
 * so it arrives here parsed rather than as a tail the caller has to recognise in prose, and it is
 * printed beside the criterion it belongs to — the row's last column on stdout, an `evidence` field
 * under `--json`, and a stderr line counting the marked rows so a reviewer scanning diagnostics
 * cannot miss that this contract has any. Those rows are graded on the evidence they name, never on
 * the diff alone (`./outside-diff-evidence.ts`).
