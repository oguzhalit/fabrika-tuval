/**
 * `review verdicts` reads every verdict marker and its binding against the live head.
 * See ./command.ts help for output fields and binding tokens.
 *
 * **It resolves the same binding `ship gate` does, and that is the point of the coupling.** This verb
 * is what routes an agent to re-review, so a row reading `stale` where the merge gate would read
 * `pass` re-imposes the very tax the content binding removed — through a second opinion nobody
 * would think to suspect. Both call `bindToContent`, so they cannot disagree.
 *
 * An unresolved head cannot support a binding comparison, but the markers were still seen and
 * remain reportable facts.
 *
 * Malformed markers stay in the sweep. Dropping one could make a failed PR read as unreviewed.
 *
 * Superseded verdicts stay visible too. `review post` preserves them below ./supersede.ts's fence;
 * reporting only the surviving verdict would hide the history the append preserves.
