/**
 * The unified-diff walk: how many files the served diff actually carries, and where each added or
 * removed line sits.
 *
 * **The completeness proof is the file count, and only the file count.** The bytes are local
 * `git diff <base>...<head>` at the bound commit (`diff-verb.ts`), and the denominator is a
 * second read of that same range — `git diff --name-only -z`, which emits one path per `diff --git`
 * entry — so both counts come from git over one range under one set of flags, and rename pairing and
 * merge-base choice cancel instead of being compared across systems. GitHub's declared
 * `changed_files` is still read and reported beside them, and never refused on: it is a third
 * party's answer over its own merge base and its own rename detection.
 *
 * What that proves is narrow, and worth stating at its real precision: the scanned bytes carry **at
 * least as many** entries as the `--name-only` read lists. It is a cardinality test, never an
 * entry-identity one — it does not establish that the two reads name the same files, and it does not
 * establish that the range is the right range, so a fault that shortens both reads alike stays
 * invisible to it. A short count is refused because serving a prefix as the whole PR is the
 * blind-PASS class one layer down.
 *
 * No truncation marker is matched, because there is nothing to match. `application/vnd.github.diff`
 * does not truncate — over its limits it refuses with HTTP 406 and `errors[].code = "too_large"`,
 * under them it serves whole (verified against the live endpoint) — and these bytes do not come from
 * that endpoint anyway. The earlier claim that GitHub truncates at the API tier was asserted from
 * intuition and is false (CLAUDE.md's grounding rule).
 *
 * The count sees whole files only: a diff cut inside the last file's hunks still carries every
 * header and passes. That is a stated bound of the proof, not a failure mode defended against — no
 * producer for that shape is known.

/**
 * Both header forms git emits, per side. A path holding a non-ASCII byte (`core.quotePath`, on by
 * default), a backslash, or a double quote is written `"a/…"` with C-style escapes, and the two
 * sides quote independently — a rename to a Turkish name gives `diff --git a/plain.ts "b/ünlü.ts"`.
 * Matching only the bare form made a quoted file invisible: it undercounted the completeness proof
 * AND handed that file's hunk lines to the previous file.
