 * the composed body is checked twice before it is sent, and the two checks read it through
 * *different* eyes on purpose: one compares lines against the old bytes, the other re-parses the
 * composed body through the **registered wire format** and asserts the block grew by exactly one row.
 * A composition that inserted the row somewhere the parser does not see it passes the first and reds
 * on the second, which is the whole reason both exist.
