/**
 * `review preview` — the read-only path extraction behind review diff filtering: matched paths,
 * exclusions, and the active class partition at the requested filter placement, with the filtered
 * diff available on the same answer. No LLM, no write. Three subjects, mutually exclusive, in
 * parity with the group's other read verbs: `--diff-file <path>` reads a unified diff on disk (no
 * PR, no network); a pull-request number, with optional `--sha`/`--repo`, binds a head
 * (`./head.ts`) and reads the PR's three-dot diff out of the object database exactly as
 * `review diff` does; `--base`/`--tip` names a range (`./range-flags.ts`), whose diff is taken
 * from the range's own merge base — the same commit `./content-binding.ts` digests.
 *
 * **A short read never reaches the filter.** The PR and range subjects prove completeness the
 * same way before the filter runs: `./diff.ts`'s `filesInDiff` against `diffRangePaths` over ONE
 * range, both operands from git, so a diff carrying fewer files than git lists for the same range
 * refuses `INCOMPLETE_SCAN` before the exclusion set is applied — there a deliberate exclusion
 * can never masquerade as a truncation. The `--diff-file` subject reads its bytes exactly as
 * given — there is no range to prove a census against — yet its exclusions are still enumerated,
 * and the `x-fabrika-filter`, `x-fabrika-excluded-path` and `x-fabrika-unexcluded-path` headers
 * still name only what was left out on purpose. The set itself is the effective one: the shipped
 * defaults, minus what `.fabrika.jsonc`'s `reviewFilterUnexclude` removes, plus what its
 * `reviewFilterExclusions` and `--exclude` add — a removed default nothing re-added is enumerated
 * (`un-excluded` rows, the `unexcluded` JSON field, the diff header) so a narrowed filter is
 * stated, never silent.
 *
 * Refusal mapping: a placement other than `after`, two subjects at once, or a PR-subject
 * modifier beside a subject that binds no head seats on `OFF_VOCABULARY` — a modifier that would
 * be silently ignored is refused instead; an exclusion pattern matching a governed root seats on
 * `GOVERNED_FILTER` (the hard invariant); an unreadable diff file, an unreadable git read, or a
 * subject that cannot be bound is `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN` — never a permissive empty read.
