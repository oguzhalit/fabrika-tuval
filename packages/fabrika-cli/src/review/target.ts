/**
 * The precondition every `review` verb runs before it judges anything: resolve the repo, resolve the
 * PR, and split *proven absent* from *unreadable*.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in each verb because the split is the group's whole fail-closed posture
 * and six copies of it are six chances to fold the two outcomes together — a 404 is a fact about the
 * repository, an unreachable GitHub is not a fact about anything.
 *
 * The scanned-count line is here for the same reason: this group's convention is that every list
 * read reports what it saw on stderr, and a verdict driven by a silently truncated read is a verdict
 * over unknown scope.
