/**
 * The content digest's own tier: the `--raw` walk, the serialization, and the two legs the
 * digest is ruled to cover.
 *
 * The assertions that carry the design are the two `changes the digest` cases. A digest that moved
 * only when the destination blob moved would miss a head that drops its own edit onto a base that
 * already made it; a digest that moved only when the diff moved would miss the merge that leaves
 * the three-dot diff identical and the merged file different. Both are what the ruling is about, so
 * both are asserted from a fixture rather than argued in a comment.
