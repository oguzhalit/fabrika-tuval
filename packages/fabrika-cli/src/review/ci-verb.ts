/**
 * `review ci` — the live check-run rollup at a head, fail-closed on incomplete enumeration.
 *
 * The rollup judges only the runs the base branch's declared required set names
 * (`./blocking.ts`, the authority `ship checks` judges by too). A red outside that set is named on the
 * notes channel and never settles `--wait`, so a repository-wide red cannot end the wait while the
 * required checks are still queued behind it.
 *
 * v1's CI-at-head read was dispatch-prompt-dependent: a gate ruled on a live RED check as a prose
 * question because one sentence was omitted. This verb is that read made structural, and its
 * refusals are what keep it honest — zero declared runs is a vacuous green, an enumeration short
 * of `total_count` is never read as "no red checks", and a complete enumeration that no gate of
 * this repo produced is not green either (`gate-coverage.ts`). That last read is over each run's own
 * provenance — the head it carries and the event that made it — because a workflow path says which
 * file ran and never which bytes it opened: a repo-authored `pull_request_target` run sits at the
 * head and checks out the base.
 *
 * `checks` is a status tally, not a row per run: it is an evidence-array — the review
 * skill acts on `rollup` and no skill iterates the rows — and a repo with 34 workflows paid ~20 rows
 * of it on every read. What the rows were *for*, naming the red and still-running checks, moves to
 * the notes channel below, the same split `ship checks` landed on.
 *
 * `--wait` is the bounded in-verb wait a reviewer spawned minutes after a push needs: a `pending`
 * there is the ordinary state of a healthy PR, and a caller that cannot wait for it has only a park
 * on a human to offer for a condition that clears itself. The verb owns the loop so no skill
 * ever sleeps — `claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/skill-conventions.md` §14 — and it loops on `pending`
 * alone: every refusal and the `no-producer` answer are states no amount of waiting changes, so they
 * return on the first read rather than burning the budget. The governance floor is such a state on
 * both of its rollups — `governance-owed` on the `pending` one, `governance-stale` on the `red`
 * (`./governance-owed.ts`).
