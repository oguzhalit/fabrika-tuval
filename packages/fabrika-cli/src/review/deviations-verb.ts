/**
 * `review deviations` — the PR body's `## Deviations` state, its entries, and the Tier-M token scan
 * over the head diff.
 *
 * The verb reports states and facts, never the §DEV verdict row: whether the PR *owes* the section,
 * and whether an entry's substance covers a finding, are Tier R — the judgment layer's. What this
 * makes mechanical is the one thing a grep can hold an author to: a `None.` printed beside a
 * non-empty Tier-M list is a falsified disclosure the caller sees in one read.
 *
 * The scan inherits `review diff`'s completeness proof, so a truncated diff reds here too — an
 * under-reported hit list beside a `None.` reads as a checked-clean disclosure that was never
 * checked. It inherits the same commit binding for the same reason (`head.ts`): a hit list
 * read from a head nobody scoped is under- or over-reported against the disclosure it is printed
 * beside, and the falsified-`None.` read this verb exists to make possible is only as good as the
 * tree the tokens came from.
