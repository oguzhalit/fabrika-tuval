/**
 * `review post` — the single sanctioned verdict emit.
 *
 * Six steps, each gating the next: re-resolve the live head, recompute the class set at the commit
 * the verdict binds, compose the first line through the wire format's `emit` (stamping the
 * write-recency line under it), leak-scan the assembled comment, upsert **one comment per
 * namespace**, and read it back unconditionally from live PR state.
 *
 * Every one of those is a scar. A hand-rolled `gh api` emit posted a literal path and
 * self-reported a false PASS, which is why the read-back re-fetches instead of trusting a carried
 * variable. The namespace set is recomputed rather than trusted because v1 got "a gate never emits
 * another gate's marker" free from one-skill-per-namespace and this owner does not. The `12` refusal
 * is `bindToHead`'s `Stale` arm applied at the write seam, where its absence costs the most. And the
 * marker is the comment's **literal first line** — a second marker stacked on line 2 is un-anchored,
 * resolves its namespace empty, and fail-closes a substantively-passing PR.
 *
 * The head re-resolve runs **before** the recompute, and the recompute reads at the bound commit
 * (`head.ts`). `12` labels the tree; only the binding makes the derived set provably that
 * tree's — the two are separate reads, and a force-push that rewinds back onto `--sha` passes `12`
 * clean while the PR-number file endpoint serves some other head's list.
 *
 * The upsert **appends**: a matched comment keeps its prior verdict verbatim below
 * `./supersede.ts`'s fence and the fresh verdict takes the first line, because GitHub keeps no
 * comment-body history and a PATCH over a verdict is that verdict gone. A post that would
 * retire a standing verdict of the opposite polarity is `17` until `--supersede` says so out loud.
 *
 * With `--base`/`--tip` the verb runs the range-scoped path instead (`./range-post.ts`): the
 * positional is the child issue, the marker is `../wire/range-verdict-marker.ts`'s, and the same
 * namespace rule is asked of the range's own changed paths.
 *
 * **A `PASS` carries one obligation the six steps do not: `--round`, and the `18` fence under it.**
 * A reviewer that routes an in-scope finding appends it as an acceptance criterion, and that row
 * binds the *next* cycle — so a `PASS` on the round that appended it is the one terminal it cannot
 * survive: the lane folds to `ship`, the PR merges, the issue auto-closes, and the finding is gone
 * with an artifact behind it that reads as correct. `./appended-this-round.ts` is that read, and it
 * runs on both subjects — a PR here, a child's range on the ranged arm — because a child's reviewer
 * routes findings the same way.

 *
 * The **advisory** carrier cannot go through the format: its first line deliberately withholds the
 * SHA, so `read` calls it `Malformed` by design. It is verified through its own two
 * anchors instead — the advisory first line and the canonical `Reviewed-head:` body line — and then
