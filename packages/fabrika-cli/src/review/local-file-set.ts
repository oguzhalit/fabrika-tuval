/**
 * The file set a PR-scoped verb derives over, and GitHub's declared `changed_files` reported beside
 * it — never obeyed as a floor.
 *
 * {@link readLocalFileSet} is the local three-dot read behind `review scope`, `governance scope`,
 * `governance guards` and `governance sweep`. {@link platformFileSet} is the same report for a
 * caller whose enumeration is GitHub's own `pulls/<n>/files` list: `ship scope`, `ship cp-approval`,
 * `ship gate`, `ship floor`, `ship release`, `heal-ci diagnose` and `review-ui route`. Two readers,
 * one result type and one place the two wordings live, so no caller hand-writes a third sentence
 * about the same disagreement.
 *
 * **The enumeration IS the file set, and GitHub's `changed_files` is a second opinion reported beside
 * it.** The two counts disagree for reasons that have nothing to do with a truncated read: git pairs
 * a rename into one `--name-only` path where GitHub counts two, and GitHub's count is computed
 * against a base it cached when the PR was last pushed, which a merge commit from an earlier review
 * round can leave behind the current trunk indefinitely. Nothing on the reviewer's side re-reads
 * or invalidates that cache, so a verb that refuses on the disagreement strands the round with no
 * act available to clear it.
 *
 * So the disagreement leaves as a diagnostic line and never as a refusal. What is still refused is
 * what git alone establishes: an unreadable range is UNKNOWN, and an empty one is each caller's own
 * zero-scope refusal — this function reports the read and leaves those codes where they are, because
 * the three callers seat them at three different exits.
 *
 * A second enumeration of the *same range* is a different proof and stays with its caller: comparing
 * `--name-status` against `--name-only`, or a served diff body against the status list, is git
 * against git, and a shortfall there really is a truncated read.
 *
 * The first ruling named the two governance verbs. The second carried the identical retirement to
 * the three verbs on the enqueue and unstick paths, where the strand had moved rather than closed:
 * `ship gate`, `ship floor` and `heal-ci diagnose`, plus `governance sweep`'s fourth copy of the
 * same arm. Its third application reached the last three copies the `ship` group held: `ship scope`,
 * the first verb a `ship` run makes, `ship cp-approval`, which gates the §CP discharge, and
 * `ship release`, off the merge path. The sweep behind that one declared the job finished while
 * `review-ui route` still carried the arm, and a fourth application retired that copy too — so no
 * verb in this package refuses on the declared count any more.

/**
 * The file set of a caller that enumerates through `pulls/<n>/files` rather than a git range.
 *
 * Every `ship` verb that enumerates changed files reads that list, as do `heal-ci diagnose` and
 * `review-ui route`, and each has a reason not to bind a head: the `ship` verbs are the merge
 * authority and the CI job relaying it, and `ship gate`'s common path is asserted to touch git not
 * at all — a merge gate that needs a fetch to answer is a merge gate a checkout-less caller cannot
 * run. `heal-ci sweep` loops this chain over every open PR and ends the board on one refusal, so a
 * fetch per PR would trade this strand for a heavier one. `review-ui route` runs from wherever the
 * reviewer posts from and has already refused unless the live head is the `--sha` its record binds,
 * so the platform's list enumerates the tree it attests without fetching it.
 *
 * `listPullFiles` already proves its own pagination exhausted, so what is left to compare is the
 * enumeration against the pull-request record's `changed_files` — one platform read against another,
 * and the record's is the stale side. That disagreement is reported. An **empty** list is each
 * caller's own zero-scope refusal, seated where that caller seats it.
 *
 * That exhaustion proof stops at {@link PULL_FILES_CAP}: the endpoint serves at most that many
 * files and ends its Link chain normally there, so a truncated list reads as a complete one. It is
 * the one real truncation the retired count comparison used to catch by accident, and `capped` is
 * what catches it on purpose — each caller refuses on it, because a floor or a diagnosis derived
 * from a list the platform cut short — or a ui class, which such a list can only shrink — is derived
 * over scope nobody read.
