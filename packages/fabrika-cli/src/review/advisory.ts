/**
 * The §CP advisory carrier: a first line that withholds the SHA, and a canonical body line that

 * an auto-mergeable `PASS @ <sha>` marker, while `Reviewed-head: @ <sha>` in the
 * body records the head that was actually inspected. The carrier is PASS-only — a §CP
 * FAIL posts the ordinary FAIL marker — which `review post` enforces on `10`.
