/**
 * `review deviations`' view of the PR body's `## Deviations` section: which of four states it is in,
 * and what it discloses.
 *
 * The grammar is not here. It lives in `../wire/deviations.ts`, the registered format both this
 * reader and `build pr`'s body-shape check resolve against — one writer and one reader cannot
 * disagree about a shape neither of them owns. This module is the projection from the wire's
 * three answers onto the four states the review verdict vocabulary needs, and nothing else.
 *
 * The fourth state is why a projection is needed at all: `None.` is a *checked* claim, and
 * collapsing it into `absent` is how "never considered it" comes to read as "nothing to disclose".
 * The wire carries it as a `Found` of its own tag; this reader names it `none-declared`.
