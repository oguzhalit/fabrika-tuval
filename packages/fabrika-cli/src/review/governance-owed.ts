/**
 * The two rollups a `review ci` caller must not read as someone else's problem: the governance floor
 * waiting on the very shell that is reading it.
 *
 * One floor splits across two rollups. `absent` leaves the check-run `in_progress`, so the
 * head is `pending` and a `--wait` would sit out its whole budget ({@link governanceOwed}).
 * `stale` concludes `failure`, so the head is `red` and the verb returns at once
 * ({@link governanceStale}). Both are the same shape underneath — the reviewer shell that
 * runs `review ci` is the shell that owes the verdict, so nothing external will ever move the floor
 * — and both need the workflow run beside the check-run to be sure the row came from this repo's own
 * floor job rather than somewhere this read cannot vouch for.
