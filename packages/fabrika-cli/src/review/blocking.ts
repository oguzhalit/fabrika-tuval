/**
 * The blocking authority: which check contexts at a head may stop a pull request.
 *
 * One module because four verbs answer the same question — `ship checks`, `heal-ci diagnose`,
 * `heal-ci logs` and `review ci` — and three derivations of one predicate are three answers to one
 * question. Each of them used to decide it locally off the name denylist in `./rollup.ts`, or, in
 * `review ci`'s case, not at all.
 *
 * **The base branch's declared required set is the authority.** A red outside it is reported and
 * never blocks. The denylist survives here as the fallback for a branch that declares nothing, and
 * as nothing else.
 *
 * The two zero-signal reads are kept apart because they route differently:
 *
 * - `unprobeable` — the required set could not be read at this token's permission. **No verb may
 *   answer a colour over it.** The read failure itself is the named cause, so a lane waits or parks
 *   on that rather than on a check's conclusion.
 * - `no-requirements` — the read succeeded and the branch declares nothing required. That is a
 *   branch nobody has said what gates, not a branch that gates nothing, so the denylist definition
 *   holds and every non-informational red blocks as it did before. A branch whose repository plan
 *   offers neither rulesets nor branch protection lands here too: it cannot declare a required
 *   check, and GitHub's plan-gate 403 says so to every token, so it is no permission finding.
 *
 * Contexts are matched as the platform names them, against the branch the pull request targets —
 * never `main` by name, because the authority belongs to the base a merge would land on.
