/**
 * The range digest's durability, driven against **real git** in a throwaway repository.
 *
 * The claim under test is not one about hashing — it is one about what git leaves behind when a
 * child's range is merged into an epic branch. "A clean merge preserves the destination blobs" and
 * "a conflict resolution moves them" are statements about a program's behaviour, so they are run
 * rather than reasoned about (CLAUDE.md: ground platform claims in source or in a real run).
 *
 * What is exercised here is the derivation the shipped code performs: the argv from
 * {@link rawDiffArgs}, the walk in {@link parseRaw}, the serialization in {@link contentDigest} and
 * the pathspec from {@link judgedPaths}. The Effect wrappers around them (`rangeContentAt`,
 * `rangeDigestOnto`) fold the same pieces over a scripted shell in `content-binding.unit.test.ts` —
 * that split is deliberate: `execCapture` runs in the process's own working directory, so pointing
 * it at a fixture repository would mean mutating the test runner's cwd.
