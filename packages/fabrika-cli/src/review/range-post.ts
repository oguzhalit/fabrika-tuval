/**
 * The range-scoped write path `review post --base/--tip` and `governance post --base/--tip` share —
 * one composer for the marker `lane prove`'s epic-child arm reads.
 *
 * A child's verdict lands on the **child issue**, not a PR: the epic run opens one tail PR,
 * so mid-run there is no PR surface to bind a head-scoped marker to, and the two SHAs
 * the range names stop being history the moment the range merges into the epic branch. What binds
 * is the content digest, which is why this path composes through
 * `../wire/range-verdict-marker.ts` — the exact reader `proveRangeVerdicts` folds — and never the
 * head-bound format.
 *
 * One module rather than a per-verb copy because the two verbs differ in exactly one decision —
 * which namespace the range's own paths admit — and that decision arrives as {@link RangeGate.admit},
 * each verb's fail-closed rule intact: `review post` refuses a namespace the range did not derive,
 * `governance post` refuses a range touching no governance root. Everything else — target proof,
 * digest, leak scan, upsert, read-back — is the same six-step contract as the PR-scoped path, asked
 * of an issue and a range instead of a PR and a head.
 *
 * **A re-post appends; it never replaces.** The prior verdict is retired verbatim below
 * `./supersede.ts`'s fence and the fresh one takes the first line, because GitHub keeps no
 * comment-body history and this path's verdict has no second copy anywhere — a child opens no PR, so
 * the comment *is* the record of that child's review, and `lane prove` derives a refusal from it.
 * Retiring a standing verdict of the opposite polarity is {@link SUPERSEDES_VERDICT} until
 * `--supersede` says so out loud, and that refusal keys on the **range** rather than a head: the
 * range dimension plays the head dimension's role here, and it is already
 * {@link carriesNamespaceOver}'s upsert key, so the refusal and the upsert cannot disagree about
 * which slot is at stake.
