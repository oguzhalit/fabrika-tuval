/**
 * The guard-probe half of the ocr-port filter spike's refusal union.
 *
 * The union is **derived, not declared**: every probe path is composed out of a guard module's own
 * exported corpus constant, cited by source file, and `guard-trees.sync.unit.test.ts` re-reads each
 * cited source to assert the constant is still exported there — so a guard that moves or renames
 * its corpus reds this table instead of silently shrinking what the filter refuses to blind. The
 * governed roots are read from `.fabrika.jsonc` at runtime by the calling verb and handed in as
 * probes (`governedRootProbes`), never hardcoded here.
 *
 * Probes, not pattern algebra: a guard is represented by one or two paths it actually reads, and a
 * pattern is refused when it could match one of those. An algebraic intersection test against a
 * universe-wide surface (leak-guard's `*.md` doc sweep) would refuse every directory exclusion,
 * including the spike's own defaults — probe granularity is the reading under which the mission's
 * default exclusion set and its refusal invariant are both satisfiable. Beside the probe arm,
 * `refusalFor` also refuses a pattern that forcibly aligns onto a governed root segment-wise, by
 * literal name — including when the pinning sits behind a leading double-star segment, where a
 * prefix-string check would miss it — and `previewOf`'s runtime backstop refuses the moment the
 * filter actually excludes a path under a governed root, so a pattern too generic to refuse at
 * the pattern level cannot silently carve governed content out of the read either.
