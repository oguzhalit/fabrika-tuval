/**
 * `review scope` — the head SHA, the linked issue, the artifact-class partition of the PR's changed
 * files, the namespaces they require, the `self` / `harness` flags, and the `governance`
 * requirement.
 *
 * **The class rows and the namespace rows are `ship scope`'s own derivation, printed here too** —
 * `partitionWithUi` + `shipNamespacesOf`, the same objects the merge gate enforces. The two verbs
 * cannot answer differently about one file list, because there is one answer. While this side
 * partitioned without `ui`, a reviewer on a rendered diff derived `review-code` alone, PASSed, and
 * `ship gate` refused the `review-ui` namespace nobody had routed.
 *
 * The wider set does **not** widen what this gate emits. `review post`'s fence is `namespacesOf` over
 * the three text classes and is untouched, and every derived namespace this skill cannot emit is
 * re-printed on its own `routed` row — the reviewer's trigger to hand the round to `review-ui` under
 * that skill's `routed elsewhere` terminal.
 *
 * The `governance` line reads {@link touchesGovernanceRoot} over this repo's own `governedRoots` —
 * the same derivation `governance scope` prints, over the same declared list, imported rather than
 * recomputed. `harness` is three compiled-in roots and answers a different question, so a reviewer
 * who read it as the governance requirement missed one on every decision-corpus-only diff.
 *
 * The `subsystem` rows are a third derivation, additive where the classes partition: a repo may
 * declare `reviewSubsystems` globs whose matched files each carry a constraint a reviewer applies on
 * top of the class rubric, and a path matching several globs counts under each. The rows sit between
 * the class rows and the namespace rows, sorted by subsystem name; an absent or empty key leaves the
 * output byte-identical to what it was before the key existed.
 *
 * The refusals are the point: the partition is total over **what was read**, so the verb exists to
 * make sure it is never run over less than everything. A PR GitHub reports as having zero changed
 * files reds on `7` (v1's `class-probe` read 0 files and classified `has-code` exit 0), and
 * a git read that comes back empty reds on `13` — either way there is nothing to partition.
 *
 * Empty is the whole of it. This path list IS the scope, so no second count of the same range exists
 * to call it short against, and GitHub's `changed_files` is not one: a disagreement with it is
 * reported and never refused on. That read is {@link readLocalFileSet}, shared with
 * `governance scope` and `governance guards` so the three cannot state different facts about one
 * disagreement; its docblock carries why.
 *
 * The file list is read at the **bound commit** (`head.ts`), and the head this verb prints is that
 * same commit. The namespace set is documented as both floor and ceiling, so a list drawn from a
 * different commit than the printed head derives a namespace nobody judged — or drops one. The
 * config the classes derive over is read at that same commit and its merge base
 * (`./class-config.ts`), for the same reason.
