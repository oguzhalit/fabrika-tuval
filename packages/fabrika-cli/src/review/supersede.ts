/**
 * The superseding envelope — the bytes a verdict re-post puts between the fresh verdict and the one
 * it replaces.
 *
 * GitHub keeps no comment-body history, so a verdict PATCHed over is a verdict gone. A standing
 * FAIL became a PASS at an unchanged head and nothing anywhere recorded that a gate had ever
 * blocked. Every re-post is therefore an append, which is the ruling `../report/amend.ts`
 * already carries for issue bodies.
 *
 * The fresh verdict goes **on top**, not at the bottom. The marker is the comment's first non-blank
 * line (`../wire/marker-line.ts`), so putting the newest verdict there is what makes every reader —
 * `ship gate`, `review verdicts`, `lane prove` — resolve the newest one without knowing this
 * envelope exists. Below {@link FENCE} sits the prior verdict's own bytes, verbatim, its marker line
 * included; a marker quoted further down is not one.
 *
 * The fence is an HTML comment so it renders as nothing, and it is what {@link split} keys on: a
 * reader that must see only the live verdict — `../review/write-recency.ts`'s stamp read — slices
 * there rather than pattern-matching the heading a human could retype.
