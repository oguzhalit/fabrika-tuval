/**
 * `review scratch` — the per-lane scratch path a reviewer stages verb output under.
 *
 * `<temp root>/fabrika-review/<session-id>/<pr>-<lane-nonce>/<slug>`, the shape `build scratch` and
 * `triage scratch` already print. The review lane was the one staging lane that never got it: a
 * reviewer whose diff exceeded one read picked a generic filename in the session scratchpad, a
 * concurrent lane writing the same name replaced the bytes between two offset reads, and the verdict
 * graded one PR's criteria against another PR's diff while carrying the correct head — which nothing
 * downstream, `ship`'s re-derivation included, can detect.
 *
 * **The nonce is derived, because this group has no claim to take it from.** `build scratch` and
 * `triage scratch` key on the nonce of a claim token their lane holds; `review` ships no claim verb,
 * so there is no token to copy that derivation from. The key is instead the two facts a review lane
 * already carries and a second lane cannot both repeat:
 *
 *  - **`--lane`**, the lane key out of the spawn brief. Two reviewers running at once are two lanes,
 *    so this is what separates two lanes of one session — the axis the incident turned on.
 *  - **`--sha`**, the head `review scope` bound and every later verb is passed. Two review rounds of
 *    one lane are two reviews of two trees, and without the head in the key round 2 reads round 1's
 *    staged diff under the same slug — the same wrong-tree read, one round later.
 *
 * Both are required: a default for either would hand back a path shared with whatever the missing
 * axis was supposed to separate, which is the failure this verb exists to make unconstructible. When
 * no lane can be named the verb refuses (`1`) rather than degrading to a session-wide directory.
 *
 * The printed path is machine-local. `review post` and `review append-criterion` red on it through
 * the shared `report/leaks.ts` predicate (`5`), the same refusal `build pr` and `build note` make.
