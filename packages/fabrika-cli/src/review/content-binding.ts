/**
 * The content digest a verdict binds: the first 12 lowercase hex of the SHA-256 of a canonical
 * serialization of `git diff --raw base...head`.
 *
 * **What it covers, in terms a reader can falsify.** One raw record per changed path names the
 * path, the change letter, both modes and **both blob object names** — the source blob in the merge
 * base and the destination blob at the head. So a digest over those records binds two things at
 * once, which is exactly the pair this binding is ruled to cover: the **three-dot diff**, because a
 * unified diff is a function of the endpoint blobs and the pinned flags and of nothing else, and
 * the **resulting content of every changed file**, because the destination blob *is* that content.
 * Nothing here reads a blob's bytes — the object names are the content, and comparing them is what
 * keeps this cheap enough to run at every gate.
 *
 * **The one thing it deliberately does not cover, and why that is the ruled trade.** A path the
 * head does not touch has no raw record, so a change to it on the base branch leaves this digest
 * equal. That is the residual this design accepts out loud: a verdict survives base movement that
 * misses every reviewed path, and dies on base movement that reaches one. It is not free — the
 * decision record that rules it carries the residual-risk argument, and it lives only there.
 *
 * **A digest that could not be computed is never a digest.** Every failure below resolves to a
 * reason, never to an empty serialization, because an empty one hashes to a perfectly well-formed
 * value that two unrelated heads would share.
 *
 * **Two scopes, one serialization.** The PR scope binds a head; the range scope binds what
 * a child's `<base>...<tip>` changed, and survives that range being merged into an epic branch
 * where those SHAs are no longer the history. Both hash the same records the same way — the range
 * half adds only the judged paths, which is what lets a later state be asked the same question.
