/**
 * `review append-criterion` — append one reviewer-authored acceptance criterion under
 * four fences.
 *
 * The fences run in this order and each is a refusal, never a warning:
 *
 * 1. **ACL-gated, fail-closed** — below `write`, or *any* ACL lookup failure, refuses on
 *    `14`. Authority comes from the ACL check, never from the text being plausible.
 * 2. **Append-only** — the new body is the old plus exactly one row, proven by a diff guard before
 *    the PATCH is sent (`./append.ts`).
 * 3. **Frozen at round K**, read from `../retry-budget.ts`'s `CAP_ROUND` — at or past
 *    the freeze the verb posts the escalation comment and appends nothing. Append-rate stays
 *    bounded by fix-rate: the finding never becomes a graded criterion. It is not thereby lost —
 *    the comment carries `./append.ts`'s escalation tag, and `build verdicts` folds it into the
 *    next repair round's findings, so the round reads it without a driver hand-writing a pointer
 *    into a spawn prompt. A human is reached only where the round budget is spent, which is
 *    the repair loop's own escalation and not this fence's.
 * 4. **In-scope-only is the caller's** — the trace-to-stated-goal test is judgment. What this verb
 *    contributes is the provenance tag, which is what makes a routed row auditable afterwards.
 *
 * v1's `reviewer-append-ac.sh` was mandated at four call sites and called at none — a first-class
 * verb is the difference between a fence and a fence description.
 *
 * **The subject is a PR or a commit range, and the fences do not move between them.** An epic child
 * has no pull request mid-run, so `--base`/`--tip` name what the round was judged over exactly as
 * they do for `review post`; all four fences run on that form unchanged, and the only
 * thing that differs is what the provenance tag can name (`./append.ts`).
 *
