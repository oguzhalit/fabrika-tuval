/**
 * The write-recency stamp: when a verdict was **written**, as distinct from when the comment slot
 * carrying it was opened.
 *
 * `review post` upserts in place — one comment per namespace — so a corrected verdict is PATCHed
 * into the slot the first one opened. A PATCH does not move `created_at`, so slot-creation time
 * says nothing about which of two live-head verdicts is the current one: a FAIL corrected into an
 * old slot reads as OLDER than an advisory merely created later, and the reader that takes the
 * latest consumes the superseded artifact. That reader is the enqueue gate, and the direction it
 * fails in is fail-OPEN.
 *
 * The stamp is the only field that moves with the verdict, so it is the ordering key and
 * `created_at` is only its floor ({@link writeRecencyOf}). Deliberately a body-carried line rather
 * than the REST `updated_at`: `updated_at` moves on any byte edit — a typo fix, a leak redaction —
 * so a cosmetic touch of the older verdict would silently re-crown it, and invisibly, since
 * `updated_at` is not rendered anywhere a human reads.
 *
 * The bytes are v1's `Verdict-written:` line, reimplemented here and never called — the same
 * relationship `./advisory.ts` has to the advisory carrier. They must stay
 * byte-identical, because v1's `verdict-match.ts` is the
 * consumer that resolves which verdict a gate acts on; `./write-recency.unit.test.ts` pins the
 * emitted line against that consumer's own matcher so the interop cannot drift unnoticed.
