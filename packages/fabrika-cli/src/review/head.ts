/**
 * The step every read verb runs before it reads anything: tie the artifact it is about to serve to
 * one commit, or refuse.
 *
 * **A SHA on a verdict is a label; bytes provably read out of that commit are the immunity.** The
 * platform's PR endpoints take a pull-request number and no commit at all, so a push landing between
 * scoping and reading serves the *new* head's bytes under the *old* head's SHA — a well-formed,
 * confident verdict over code nobody judged. The post-time
 * re-resolve cannot close it: it fires after the judging, and a rewind that lands back on the
 * recorded SHA passes it clean.
 *
 * **This is the READ binding, and it is not what a verdict survives on.** The distinction is easy
 * to lose and the content binding turns on it: what is resolved here is which commit this run's
 * bytes come out of, which is unchanged. Whether a verdict formed over those bytes is still in
 * force *after the head moves* is a separate question, answered by the content digest taken over
 * this same range
 * (`./content-binding.ts`) — a head move alone no longer settles it.
 *
 * The binding is therefore taken **here, before the read**, and every read downstream of it goes
 * through the object database at the resolved commit (`../io/git.ts`). Nothing is checked out —
 * `contract.md`'s "Considered and deliberately not derived" rules out a head worktree, and that
 * decision stands: a head that is never checked out is a head whose instructions are never loaded.
 * A fetch writes objects, not a working tree, so the two properties are not in tension.

 * exactly what an unbound read already is.
 *
 * 1. An explicit `--sha` must be **the PR's head**. A caller reading at a head the PR has moved past
 *    is judging a tree the platform no longer offers, and `review post` would refuse the verdict
 *    anyway — refusing here means it refuses *before* a human spends a review on it.
 * 2. This checkout must serve the target repository, or nothing local can witness the commit.
 * 3. The commit must be **present in the object database after fetching `pull/<pr>/head`**, and
 *    `git rev-parse` must resolve it to itself. That second half is not ceremony: a local ref or tag
 *    spelled as hex resolves to a different object, which is how a "verified" name still names the
 *    wrong tree.
 * 4. The base must resolve too, since a diff is a range and an unresolvable end makes it UNKNOWN —
 *    and so must the merge base of that tip and this head, because *that* is the end every caller
 *    downstream means by "base".
