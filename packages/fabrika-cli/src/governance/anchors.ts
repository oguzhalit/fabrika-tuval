/**
 * The anchored-invariant scan: a per-anchor **block** comparison of two commits' bytes, plus the
 * older same-line walk over a unified diff.
 *
 * An anchor is the `<!-- anchor: NAME -->` HTML comment fabrika skills already carry. The inventory
 * therefore lives **in the guarded file**, which is the whole design difference from v1's gate check:
 * that one kept a hardcoded prose list of what each gate promises, inside the reviewing skill, so the
 * copy drifted from the guards silently and nothing checked it. Anchors cannot rot while the guards
 * move, because they move with them.
 *
 * **Why a block comparison exists at all.** The diff walk below can only see an anchor whose
 * *own line* is in the diff, and it compares only the text trailing the tag on that line. Anchors in
 * this corpus are inline — `<!-- anchor: NAME --> **Claim.** …` — and the claim wraps over several
 * more lines, so a rewrite of those continuation lines left the anchor line byte-identical, produced
 * no sighting at all, and the verb answered `no-anchor-change` over a guarantee that had in fact been
 * reworded. {@link scanAnchorBlocks} compares each anchor's whole paragraph at both
 * commits, so what it sees does not depend on the shape of the diff.
 *
 * What the scan still cannot see is stated rather than implied: a guard weakened in prose carrying no
 * anchor is invisible here **by construction**. That is why the verb's third outcome is
 * `no-anchors-in-reach` — the mechanical floor reporting its own silence — and never a clearance.

 * The blanking is length-preserving on purpose: every index into the masked text is an index into the
