/**
 * The gate's own assertion of the governance floor at the head it just posted to.
 *
 * `governance-floor.yml` triggers on `pull_request` alone, so it always runs *before* the verdict it
 * looks for can exist — a governance verdict is written by an agent that has to read the diff first.
 * The job reads comment state at its own start, finds no verdict at the head, exits 18, and no
 * comment write can re-fire a `pull_request`-triggered job. Every governance-root PR therefore reds
 * at least once and only a re-run clears it.
 *
 * The founder ruled the fix direction on 2026-08-16: the gate's own post asserts the floor at its own
 * head. The gate is the one actor with no ordering problem — it knows it just wrote the verdict — and
 * the fix stays inside this package rather than editing `.github/workflows/`, which CODEOWNERS assigns
 * to the control plane.
 *
 * **Asserting is re-deriving, never claiming.** Nothing here writes a check-run or a status: it
 * re-fires the floor job, which re-runs `ship floor` against live comment state and reaches its own
 * verdict. A fabricated green is the one outcome this module must never be able to produce. The job
 * publishes that verdict as a check-run and succeeds whenever it published one, so what a re-fire
 * is owed to is the check-run's state and not the job's conclusion.
 *
 * The run IO is imported from the two homes that already serve it — `../ship/github.ts` for the runs
 * at a head, `../heal-ci/github.ts` for one run and the rerun request. A third copy of either is how
 * two groups come to disagree about what the platform returns.
