/**
 * `governance post` — the single sanctioned emit of the `governance` namespace verdict.
 *
 * Six steps, each gating the next: re-resolve the live head, re-derive the namespace requirement at
 * the bound commit, compose the first line through the `verdict-marker` wire format, leak-scan the
 * assembled comment, upsert one comment per head, and read it back unconditionally from live PR state.
 *
 * **The namespace is fixed.** There is no `--namespace` flag: this verb emits exactly one namespace,
 * so it cannot be aimed anywhere else even by a confused caller. That is the disjointness guarantee
 * made structural from the opposite direction to `review post`, which refuses a namespace outside its
 * derived set.
 *
 * **There is no advisory carrier.** §CP is not this namespace's question, the governance verdict is
 * never the §CP approval, and a carrier flag here would be a second §CP answer wearing an input's
 * clothes.
 *
 * The `14` refusal is the fail-closed condition's write-seam half: absence of a verdict on a required
 * diff is a refusal downstream, presence of one on a non-required diff is a refusal here. Both
 * directions exist so the namespace means exactly one thing.
 *
 * **A re-post appends; it never replaces.** The prior verdict survives verbatim below
 * `../review/supersede.ts`'s fence and the fresh one takes the first line, because GitHub keeps no
 * comment-body history: a FAIL PATCHed over by a PASS at one head leaves nothing showing a gate ever
 * blocked. Retiring a standing verdict of the opposite polarity is
 * {@link SUPERSEDES_VERDICT} until `--supersede` says so out loud.
 *
 * With `--base`/`--tip` the verb runs the range-scoped path instead (`../review/range-post.ts`):
 * the positional is the child issue, the marker is `../wire/range-verdict-marker.ts`'s, and
 * the same harness-touching rule is asked of the range's own changed paths. That path appends and
 * refuses the same way, keyed on the range rather than a head it does not have.
