/**
 * `governance sweep` — the uncited live-`accepted` records whose decision domain a subject touches,
 * ranked, for a subject read out of a bound commit (`--record`) or out of the corpus (`--landed`).
 *
 * **The ranking core is imported, never restated.** `decisionBearingText`, `tokenize`, the idf scoring,
 * `RARITY_FLOOR` and `DEFAULT_LIMIT` all come from `../adr/sweep.ts`. A second lexical sweep would be a
 * rival answer to a solved question, and two runs of the two verbs over the same bytes would stop
 * agreeing by construction. What this verb owns is the **subject acquisition**: `adr sweep` can only
 * read a local draft, and a review-time or digest-time subject lives in a commit.
 *
 * Lexical overlap cannot find a disagreement that shares no distinctive vocabulary, so this scan
 * cannot grant clearance. See ./command.ts help for its result states.
 * The local three-dot file set is authoritative; GitHub caches its count at the last push.
 * @ruling https://github.com/kamp-us/phoenix/issues/9322#issuecomment-5703498377
