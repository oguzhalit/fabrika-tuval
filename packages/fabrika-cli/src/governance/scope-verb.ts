/**
 * `governance scope` — whether a diff derives the governance namespace, over which harness roots,
 * with the bound head, the `self` flag, and the decision records the diff touches.
 *
 * **This is not the §CP answer, and the verb says so on stderr on every run.** fabrika's §CP model is
 * CODEOWNERS-only with no semantic detection; a second answer here could contradict a merge-gating
 * verdict. What this derives is a *separate* namespace whose verdict is the skill's judgment.
 *
 * Zero changed files is a refusal, never `not-required`: the whole value of a `not-required` answer is
 * that it was computed over everything (v1's `class-probe` read 0 files and classified `has-code` at
 * exit 0). The file list is read at the **bound commit** and the head printed is that same
 * commit, because the list is the derivation's only input.
 *
 * **On the pull-request path that list is the local three-dot read, and GitHub's `changed_files` is
 * reported beside it rather than refused on.** The read is {@link readLocalFileSet}, shared with
 * `review scope` and `governance guards`; its docblock carries why a count GitHub computes against a
 * cached base is not a floor. Zero is the one shortfall git alone establishes, and it still refuses.
 *
 * **With `--base`/`--tip` the subject is a range instead of a pull request.** An epic child
 * has no PR mid-run, so without that form §1 of the skill is unrunnable on the range form that is
 * the normal path for every `claude-plugins/**` child — and `self`, which only this verb
 * derives, is the self fence's own precondition. Both modes read the same three-dot range: unreadable
 * is UNKNOWN and empty is a refusal on either path, and neither is ever `not-required`. The
 * provably-short refusal survives on the range path alone, because there the second count is another
 * read of the same git range rather than GitHub's answer about it.
