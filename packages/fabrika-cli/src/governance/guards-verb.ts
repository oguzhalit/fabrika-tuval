/**
 * `governance guards` — the anchored invariants the bound diff removes or modifies, and the
 * guard-bearing files it touches.
 *
 * A guard weakened in prose with no anchor is invisible to this scan. The skill must still judge
 * it. See ./command.ts help for the result states; none grants clearance.
 *
 * A truncated diff is refused rather than scanned, and what proves it truncated is git against git:
 * the served diff body against the status enumeration of the same range. GitHub's `changed_files` is
 * not that proof and no longer refuses here — the file set is {@link readLocalFileSet}'s local read,
 * shared with `review scope` and `governance scope`, and the count disagreement leaves as a
 * diagnostic line. An under-reported hit list reads as a
 * checked-clean answer that was never checked. A local read of **zero** files is refused at the
 * group's zero-scope seat for that same reason: `inReach` is a denominator only over files that were
 * read, so an empty set renders `no-anchors-in-reach` at exit 0 — a scan of nothing printing clean.
 * For the same reason each changed
 * file is read at the merge base as well as at the head, so an anchor's paragraph is compared whole
 * instead of only where the diff happens to touch it — see `anchors.ts`. That "before" read
 * is a point read at one commit, not a range, so nothing recomputes a merge base for it the way a
 * three-dot diff would: reading it at the base *branch tip* compares this PR's anchors against
 * main's newest bytes and invents a move nobody made.
