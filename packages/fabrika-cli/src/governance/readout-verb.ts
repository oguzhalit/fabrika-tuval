/**
 * `governance readout` — compose the ranked rows through the `governance-digest` wire format, upsert
 * them into the durable artifact, and read them back.
 *
 * **Non-blocking by construction.** This verb writes a comment and nothing else. It sets no label,
 * touches no PR, and has no exit code meaning "the corpus is in a bad state" — a digest that could red
 * would be the retired human gate wearing a new name. Every outcome here is either
 * "the readout landed" or "the readout did not land".
 *
 * **The artifact issue is resolved, never a constant.** `$FABRIKA_GOVERNANCE_READOUT_ISSUE`, else the
 * single open issue titled exactly `Governance readout`, else a refusal naming both lookups — a
 * guessed number would publish the digest onto somebody else's issue.
