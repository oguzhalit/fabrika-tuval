/**
 * `governance digest` — the decision records that landed in a window, each with its id, title,
 * status, landing commit and the anchor delta of that commit's own diff.
 *
 * An empty window still needs an explicit answer; silence is indistinguishable from a run that
 * never happened. See ./command.ts help for the digest output.
 *
 * **The `status` field is reported, never interpreted.** Nine records on `main` read `proposed` while
 * being enforced at a live gate, so a consumer that treats `proposed` as "not law" is reading
 * a claim as an observation. The verb prints what is there and the skill judges what it means.
 *
 * **This verb ranks nothing.** Tension and blast radius are the two ruled ranking dimensions and both
 * are judgment; a ranking verb would be a second judgement wearing a verb's clothes.
