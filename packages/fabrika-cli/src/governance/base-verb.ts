/**
 * `governance base` — this skill's own text at the merge base of the diff that edits it.
 *
 * **The verb exists so the self fence is a pasteable literal.** The rule it serves — judge a
 * self-editing diff by the merge-base revision of its own text — otherwise needs a merge-base SHA the
 * model would have to compute and interpolate, which the harness's isolation verifier refuses.
 * Resolving a merge base and reading named paths at it is mechanical; judging by them is not.
 *
 * **`--path` is fenced to this skill's own directory, and that directory is resolved, not hardcoded.**
 * The fence is deliberate: a general "read any file at the merge base" verb would be a second way to
 * load instructions out of a tree, which is what the whole no-checkout posture exists to prevent. And
 * nothing is checked out here either — the bytes come from the object database.
 *
 * The `11` refusal never falls back to the head. A self fence that degrades to the head's rules on a
 * failed read is a fence that opens exactly when it is being tested.
 *
 * **`--base`/`--tip` gives an epic child the same fence.** A child has no PR mid-run, so before this
 * form a child range editing this skill was judged by its own new rules —
 * the guard opening exactly on the diff that edits the guard. The merge base of a range is
 * `merge-base(base, tip)`, the same commit the range's own three-dot diff is taken from; see
 * `../review/range-flags.ts`, which owns that grounding.
