/**
 * The spec body this group writes: its four sections, the one it renders itself, and the footer that
 * binds a filing to the source it came from.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: DECISIONS-ARE-RENDERED-NOT-AUTHORED --> **`## Decisions` is rendered from the trail
 * and never authored.** The property the whole skill exists for is that a downstream reader can tell
 * the founder's decisions from the model's synthesis without the source transcript. A
 * convention telling the model to label them would be exactly the prose invariant that holds until
 * the run that forgets; here the provenance word and the ref come from resolver output the model
 * never touches, so a mislabelled decision is not something an agent can produce by being careless.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: THE-DECISIONS-LINE-IS-PARSEABLE-BACK --> The rendered line is written so `graduate
 * emit` can recover the ref from it, which is what says which subset a spec covers. Anchoring the
 * parse on the **bolded provenance token** — a closed two-member set — is what keeps it unambiguous
 * when the decision text itself carries an em dash or a `·`, and it lets a ref carry a space and a
 * `#` (`#<n> R1.2`) without quoting.
 *
 * `report`'s `REQUIRED_SECTIONS` is deliberately not widened to hold these four: that constant is the
 * *intake* floor, and widening it would change what every intake filing in the repo requires to serve
 * one caller that is not intake.
