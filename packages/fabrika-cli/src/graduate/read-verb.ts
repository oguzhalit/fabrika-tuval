/**
 * `graduate read` — the total three-valued read of a source's emission markers.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: READ-NEVER-REFUSES-ON-CONTENT --> **This verb never refuses on marker content.** A
 * malformed marker is data: a `disregarded` row at exit `0`, never a refusal. Refusing would suppress
 * the whole emission history over one bad comment, and would let anyone with write access disable the
 * verb by posting one. See `graduate read --help` for the refusal contract.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: MALFORMED-IS-NOT-UNGRADUATED --> A source whose only marker is malformed reads
 * `ungraduated` with a non-empty `disregarded`, and a caller must read both. That is knowingly
 * conservative in the unsafe direction — `graduate emit` treats a malformed marker as unparseable too,
 * so a mangled one can let a second spec be filed — and it is stated rather than hidden. The
 * alternative, refusing every emission whenever any comment is malformed, would let one bad comment
 * block a source forever.
 *
 * Coverage is derivable from `covers` and is deliberately **not** computed here: unioning the arrays
 * against a trail is the caller's arithmetic, and doing it here would cost this verb its split test.
