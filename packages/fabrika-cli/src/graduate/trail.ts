/**
 * The decision trail: what a resolved source normalizes into, and the digest taken over it.
 *
 * Both sibling artifacts — a `grilling` session and a `wayfinding` map — reduce to one shape here:
 * a decision carries a `ref`, a `provenance` word from a closed two-member set, and its `text`. The
 * mapping functions below take the **sibling resolver's own output** as their input; nothing in this
 * module parses a session comment or a map body, because whether a question is `ruled` is already
 * answered by a verb whose whole design is answering it fail-closed against the ACL. A second parser
 * here would be a second answer to that question, and the two could disagree — which on this question
 * means one of them licenses synthesizing over an unproven ruling.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: DIGEST-NEUTRALITY --> **Both digests are neutral to every write this group makes.**
 * The digested bytes are decision triples exactly as the resolver returned them — never a comment, a
 * marker, a label or any rendered issue text. It must be so: `graduate emit` binds its marker to a
 * digest the *next* run recomputes, so a digest covering the source's comments would be changed by
 * the marker comment that emission itself posts, and every re-run would read the trail as fresh and
 * file a second spec.
