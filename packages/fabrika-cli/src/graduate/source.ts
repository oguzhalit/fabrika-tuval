/**
 * The source dispatch, and the trail derived through the sibling that owns it.
 *
 * Two verbs need the identical answer — `graduate trail` prints it and `graduate emit` re-derives it
 * to bind a spec — so it is resolved once here rather than twice beside them.
 *
 * **The resolution runs through the siblings' own readers and parses neither artifact.** A session
 * goes through `../grill/read-verb.ts`, whose four ruling clauses and ACL resolution are what `ruled`
 * *means*; a map goes through `../map/frontier.ts` and `../map/body.ts`, the module rather than `map
 * read`'s stdout, because that verb's answer carries no `## Decisions` array and a design reading
 * decisions off it could not produce a `ruled` row at all. A second parser here would be a second
 * answer to a question already decided elsewhere, and the two could disagree.
