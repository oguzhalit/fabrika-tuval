/**
 * `graduate emit` — file the one spec issue, apply the single label, read it back, and record the
 * emission on the source.
 *
 * **One transaction**, checked local-first so a refusable spec costs no API call.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: WRITE-ORDERING-IS-AN-INVARIANT --> **The spec issue is created first and the marker
 * second.** An interrupted run that wrote the marker first would leave a source claiming an emission
 * that does not exist — a trail that can never be graduated again and a spec nobody can find. The
 * reverse leaves a filed spec with no marker, which is `8` naming the orphan and which a human
 * resolves by reading the source. A missing marker is a nuisance; a marker with no issue is a
 * silently dropped spec.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: THE-BODY-MUST-MATCH-THE-TRAIL-IT-BINDS --> **The trail is re-derived here rather than
 * trusted from `--spec`.** Without that, a caller could compose against trail A and emit against a
 * source that has since moved to trail B, so the marker would bind a digest computed from B while the
 * filed body stated A's decisions. The body supplies only the ref *list*; the provenance and text the
 * digest is taken over come from the resolver, which is why a forged body cannot forge a digest.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: EIGHTEEN-IS-PER-REF-NOT-WHOLE-SECTION --> `18` compares ref by ref. A whole-section
 * equality check against the re-derived trail would fail every deliberately split spec, which would
 * reinstate the stranded remainder through a different code.
