 * The package's library surface: the pure verb cores, so a consumer (or a test) can compute an
 * outcome without spawning the bin. The CLI itself is `bin.ts`.
 *
 * The verbs are exported as namespaces, not flattened: a name means one thing inside its group and
 * carries no cross-group uniqueness obligation, so flattening would collide two groups' tables.
 * Within a group the codes come from one `<group>/codes.ts`.
