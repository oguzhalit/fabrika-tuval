/**
 * The shared exit-code registry — the one table every aligning group reads from, this group
 * included.
 *
 * The seats below are the meanings more than one verb group proves the same way: an empty stdin,
 * a malformed document, a leaked path, a proven-absent target, an UNKNOWN write, a mismatched
 * read-back, an off-vocabulary value, an unreadable precondition. Each is defined here exactly
 * once; every `<group>/codes.ts` that speaks one of these facts imports the constant rather than
 * restating a numeral, so a drift is unrepresentable rather than merely detectable. Which groups
 * claim which of these seats, and what each may add privately, is classified in
 * {@link ./exit-code-alignment.ts} — the registry holds the numbers, the alignment module holds the
 * law about them.
 *
 * History: this table lived at `report/codes.ts` until it didn't. The writing verbs shipped first,
 * so every later group seated itself against *their* module — which made one group's file the de
 * facto constitution and left `report` importing its own law secondhand through everyone else.
 * The table moved here so no group owns it, not even the one that wrote it first. The numbers below
 * are dense from `3` because they were aligned under `report`'s private band, and `27`/`28` stay
 * spoken for by that group to this day.
 *
 * `0`, `1` and `127` are the interface convention's reserved codes (see `../verb.ts`) and are
 * deliberately **not** defined here — a registry of proven outcomes has nothing to say about a
 * failure to invoke, and `2` is allocated by nothing anywhere (`../hook/codes.ts` carries that
 * hard rule).
