/**
 * The `campaign` verb group — `fabrika campaign <list|open|state>`, the `campaign` skill's half of
 * the roadmap surface.
 *
 * The adapter and nothing else: it declares the flags, hands the verb the ambient cwd and env, and
 * emits the outcome. Every decision lives in the `*-verb.ts` modules beside it.
 *
 * `--state` and `--to` are declared as strings and checked in the verbs, so a refusal can name the
 * whole closed vocabulary in this group's own words rather than emit the parser's generic message.
