/**
 * `campaign open` — append a new `paused` row pinning a milestone, past the approval trace.
 *
 * **The state is always `paused` and there is no flag to change it.** Naming a campaign and saying it
 * is being worked are two separate acts. Flipping it is `campaign state`'s, and it demands its own
 * citation.
 *
 * Nothing here checks that the milestone exists, is open, or is in sync with the board:
 * `guard roadmap-guard check` owns I1-I5, and a second answer to a merge-gating question is worse
 * than no answer at all.
