/**
 * `campaign state` — rewrite one row's `State` cell, past the approval trace.
 *
 * Selection is exact, never fuzzy, and **two rows matching is `18` rather than a first-wins pick**: a
 * lifecycle flip aimed at the wrong campaign marks a theme nobody named.
 *
 * **`20` is a refusal and not a quiet `0`.** A caller who reads "done" over a cell nobody moved
 * cannot tell a flip they made from one somebody else made first. The cell groups work and refuses
 * no lane, whatever it reads.
 *
 * Whether the milestone should be closed alongside a flip to `done` is `roadmap-guard`'s I5 and is
 * not repeated here: a second answer to a merge-gating question is worse than no answer at all.
