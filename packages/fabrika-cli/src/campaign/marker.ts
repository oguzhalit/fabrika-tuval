/**
 * The `campaign-approve:` marker — the only thing `--cites` proves about a comment's text.
 *
 *     campaign-approve: #<milestone> active · 2026-08-20T04:11:09Z
 *
 * Anchored to the comment's **first line**, split off rather than matched whole. v1 required the
 * whole body to *be* the marker, so a founder who wrote their approval and then explained it read as
 * malformed; splitting closes the inverse at the same time, since a marker quoted mid-body inside
 * somebody else's comment is a quotation, never a grant.
 *
 * **The timestamp is compared to nothing** — no staleness window, no ordering, no binding against
 * the comment's own `created_at`. It is evidence a human reader dates the ruling by, and its only
 * mechanical job is to make the marker a deliberate line rather than a phrase typed in passing.
 * Stated because a validated input with no stated effect is where one implementer adds a freshness
 * rule and another does not.
