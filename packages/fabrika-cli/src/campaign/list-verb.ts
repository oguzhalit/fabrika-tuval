/**
 * `campaign list` — the `## Campaigns` rows, parsed, optionally narrowed to one state.
 *
 * **Zero rows is a fact at exit `0`, not the zero-scope red a judging verb owes.** An absent table
 * and an empty one are one well-formed default: nothing declared is a true answer, not a failed
 * read. A judging verb would refuse here; this one supplies an input, and its empty answer is true.
 *
 * **`none` means no row survived, never "nothing is active".** A table whose every row is `paused`
 * prints those rows — someone opened each one and the file says so. Asking which themes are being
 * worked is `--state active`, and only there does such a table answer `none`.
