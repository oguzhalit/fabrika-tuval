/**
 * What an epic run's assembly branch says has already landed.
 *
 * An epic run is one branch and one PR: a child's work is merged onto `epic/<N>` and its issue stays
 * open until the single tail PR merges. So inside a run in flight, "the predecessor's issue is
 * closed" answers a different question from "the predecessor's work landed", and only the second is
 * the one a dependency gate means.
 *
 * The evidence is the git graph, never the lane's own fold — a machine's self-report is not
 * evidence, which is why `lane prove` reads commits too.
 *
 * **A mention that is not a landing cannot discharge.** The rule is {@link landingRefsIn}, which
 * recognises only the three message shapes the pipeline writes onto an assembly branch — a subject's
 * trailing `(#<n>)`, a line-anchored closing trailer, and `lane integrate`'s
 * `Merge branch 'build/<n>-…'`. `issueRefsIn` matches a bare `#<n>` anywhere, so reading *it* as
 * evidence let `refactor(tracer): rework the helper; does not touch #<n>` discharge that number's
 * edge. Recognition runs one way only: a shape the rule does not know is no evidence, so the edge
 * keeps the board's state and the gate refuses.
 *
 * **The read is also the run's own commits, never everything reachable from the branch tip.** The
 * set is `<merge base with the trunk>..epic/<N>`, the two-dot shape `lane prove` locates a child's
 * range with. A one-dot walk sweeps in the whole trunk history the branch was cut from, where a
 * years-old commit closing its own `#<n>` would discharge an edge this run never built. The two
 * bounds are independent: the range says which commits may speak, the landing rule says what
 * counts as speaking.
