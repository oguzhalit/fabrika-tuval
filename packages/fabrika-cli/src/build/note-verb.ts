/**
 * `build note` — post a progress or handoff comment, head-stamped, leak-guarded, read back.
 *
 * **It runs only the posting guards — never the tree assertions.** A stop-report must stay postable
 * from a tree `build tree` just refused; a note that could only be written from a healthy lane is a
 * note that cannot report the lane being broken.
 *
 * When the target resolves to a pull request the note carries the PR's head SHA at post time, so a
 * reader can see at a glance that a note predates a later push. Without it a spot judgement carries no
 * freshness signal at all, which is the stale-repair-note class.
