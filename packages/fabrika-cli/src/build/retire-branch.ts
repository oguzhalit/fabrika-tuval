/**
 * Which of an epic child's lane branches is superseded, and what a retired branch is named.
 *
 * Pure, and split from the verb because the whole safety argument sits here: the survivor is a
 * branch the board **attests** to, never the one a heuristic prefers. A child's branch is never
 * pushed, so a wrong pick moves the only copy of somebody's work out from under the lane still
 * building on it — which is why an unattested set supersedes nothing and refuses instead.
 *
 * Retirement is a rename out of `build/`. Nothing here deletes: after it the branch still exists,
 * still carries every commit, and is still reachable by name; what changes is that
 * `childLaneBranches` (`./lane.ts`) no longer nominates it, so `traceRange` (`../lane/prove.ts`) is
 * left with one candidate and `lane prove` locates the range instead of refusing.
