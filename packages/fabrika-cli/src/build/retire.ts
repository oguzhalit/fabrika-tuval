/**
 * The release predicate `build retire` turns on: may this worktree's checkout be taken from it?
 *
 * Pure, and separated from the verb because the whole ruling lives here — the two licenses are
 * board-attested positive statements, and neither is an inference from a tree that looks idle, so
 * the ban on evicting a lane by inference is satisfied rather than widened.
 *
 * **Dirty is not an input to either board license.** The founder's ruling rejects it explicitly:
 * agents routinely leave a worktree dirty long after its ticket merged, so dirtiness is a false
 * negative for "work in progress" and reading it would keep the deadlock in the case that most needs
 * clearing.
 *
 * The third license covers the case the board says nothing about at all — no
 * authorized claim marker carries the branch's lane nonce, because the claim was released. Nothing
 * holds that lane, so there is no claim to evict; but with no board statement to lean on, the
 * evidence is `./reap.ts`'s rather than a board license's, and it is read the same way: a tree goes
 * only on positive proof that it carries nothing, and every other case holds.
 *
 * **What it counts as carried is what the removal would strand**, not what the branch is ahead by. A
 * removal takes the checkout and leaves the branch, so a commit the tree's own lane branch reaches
 * survives it by name and is nothing to lose; counting it held every salvaged tree forever, since
 * committing the work the uncommitted clause named was what tripped the commit clause. Only an
 * uncommitted path and a commit no ref of this clone reaches — a detached HEAD's orphans — die with
 * the checkout, and those are what hold. The ruling above is about *proof*, and proof of carrying
 * nothing is what this still demands.
