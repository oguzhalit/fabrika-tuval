/**
 * `build claim` / `build confirm` / `build release` — one protocol, three verbs, in one file because
 * splitting them across three is how two of them come to disagree about who holds a lane.
 *
 * The race is detect-then-tiebreak, not a lock: post the marker, **re-read**, and the earliest
 * authorized marker wins. Posting alone only detects a race; the checkpoint read is what resolves it,
 * and a claim that skipped it would let two staggered co-racers both proceed.
 *
 * A lost race must stay distinct from an unreadable marker set or a missing session identity.
 * See ./command.ts help for the refusal codes.
 *
 * A loser retracts its **own** marker and nothing else — never another lane's, which is the one write
 * this protocol must never make. Which marker is its own is decided by the whole token: `claim` races
 * under the one it just minted, and `confirm`/`release` under the `--token` that `claim` handed back,
 * so a sibling lane of the same session is a co-racer here rather than the same claimant.
 *
 * **One LANE leaves at most one marker on a thread** — the fixed point, keyed on the lane rather
 * than the session. `claim` takes an optional `--token`: handed the token it already holds, it reads
 * ownership before writing and answers `won` with that same marker, posting nothing; handed none, it
 * is a fresh lane and races. `release` sweeps every marker carrying THIS lane's token, not merely the
 * winning one, and `claim` answers with `ownership.marker.token` — the token `requireClaim` will read.
 * Without that, N claims left N markers, `claim` printed its own fresh nonce while every other verb
 * read the earliest, and each `release` peeled one off a stack — which is how
 * `build branch --resume` cut a branch off a nonce the caller was never shown. Session-scoped, those
 * same rules told a sibling lane it held its neighbour's claim, so the scope is the lane.
 *
 * The single exception to "a lane retracts only its own marker" is a succession the board attests:
 * `adopt` records that a named session is gone and this lane inherits its claim, and `release` then
 * retracts the claim and the adopt together. No TTL, no lease, no steal — the successor
 * writes a comment an ACL check reads, exactly like every other authority in this protocol, and the
 * adopt names the inheriting lane by its whole token so succession does not re-widen ownership back
 * to a session. **The `15` names that route**, under the same gate `release`'s foreign-claim refusal
 * names it: a claim lost to another session had no pointer to the one verb that resolves it, so an
 * agent following its skill to the letter stopped at a stranded lane it could have taken.
 *
 * **`claim` runs the admission test before it writes anything; `confirm` and `release` never run it.**
 * The fence decides what may *start*, so a label changed mid-lane must not strand a
 * running lane or block its release. Claiming is the one moment every path goes through — a number
 * handed straight to `claim` passes through no pool — which is why the refusal has teeth here and is
 * advice at the pool.
 *
 * Blockedness rides the same moment but not the same module: the native `blocked_by`
 * graph is the one carrier of "do not start this yet", and the gate reading it is composed AFTER the
 * pure axes, since those answer without IO and a number they refuse should refuse on the cheaper
 * fact. That gate carries the assembly-branch discharge of [`./discharge.ts`](./discharge.ts), the
 * same derivation `build eligible` answers from: without it the two seams disagreed on one edge, and
 * every sequential epic tracer after the first parked at a human.
 *
 * **That gate binds a build-purpose claim and no other.** Planning and plan-gating an epic write no
 * code, and they are precisely the work that should happen while the epic's blocker is still being
 * built — so `--purpose plan` and `--purpose gate` skip the graph read entirely and print
 * `purposeBlockednessLine` in its place.
 *
 * In repair the number is a **PR**, which carries no home and no audience of its own, so the test
 * runs over the issue that PR serves. The repair route passes that issue explicitly and the
 * plural linkage reader selects it without reference-order dependence — and when that issue is
 * `type:decision` the audience axis does not bind, because triage routes a decision to
 * `ready-for:human` by default and a repair lane would otherwise fail a fence it had no way to
 * satisfy. The default is not an exclusion — a decision issue carrying a founder ruling
 * comment is buildable as transcription — so the exemption is read off the target being
 * a PR, never off the pairing being impossible.

 * A fresh claim refuses on **any** standing verdict, not only a `FAIL`: a `PASS` says the child was
 * built and graded just as loudly, and it is the more finished of the two, so admitting it was the
