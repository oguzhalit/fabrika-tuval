/**
 * `build check` — this surface's validators, run **in this tree**.
 *
 * The tree binding is the design, not an option. A green borrowed from another checkout returned
 * another tree's answer three times in one session, and the same thing recurred on the review side.
 * Whether a validator reads a build cache is the repo's own declaration, not this verb's: a
 * content-addressed cache keyed on the inputs answers for this tree too, so a repo may stop paying
 * to re-derive what such a key already holds. And the command set is the repo's declaration
 * read by the verb, not the agent's memory: v1 mandated the exact CI commands in prose with nothing
 * enforcing it (`SKILL.md:895-935`).
 *
 * **This verb predicts; the gate decides.** The repo's CI gate owns redness, and where they disagree the
 * gate's answer supersedes this one (interface convention rule 6). Nothing here re-reads CI.
 *
 * **Every lane run also sweeps the shipped local-tree guards, whatever the surface.** A guard that only
 * needs the checked-out tree runs here so it reds on the builder's machine before it reds in CI, and
 * each member is named in the answer — `guard <name> <leaf>` in `ran`, or `skipped: <name>
 * (<reason>)` for one that refused, which is a disclosure and never a pass. Membership is declared
 * beside each guard's registration in `guard/command.ts` and nowhere else; see
 * {@link sweepLocalTreeGuards}.
 *
 * **The repo's declared config validators run on every surface of a lane run too**, each one only
 * when the diff touches a file it `reads` — see {@link runConfigValidators}. That is what lets a diff
 * of root config files, or of non-JS source such as Java, alone go green or red instead of refusing
 * as unvalidatable.
 *
 * **`--probe` is the one run that is not a lane run**, and it does neither: it starts the declared
 * code validators and nothing else — see {@link runProbe}.
 *
 * `--surface` is an **anchor, not a second classifier**: naming the surface is a judgement the skill
 * makes reading the issue, and a verb that guessed it from file extensions would be wrong exactly on
 * the mixed diffs where the answer matters. The verb takes the skill's answer and refuses one the diff
 * provably contradicts.
 *
 * **Green means "the validators ran and passed", never "I could not tell."** See {@link classifyDiff}
 * for the unvalidatable file class that keeps that distinction representable, and
 * {@link notCoveredBy} for the per-surface coverage the green's `unvalidated` list reports, and
 * {@link readMarkdown} for the file the verb could not open.
 *
 * **A prose red must be this diff's.** The leak scan is baselined against the merge base, so a file
 * that merely enters a diff no longer hands its author every defect line it already carried; the
 * shape and its deliberate limits live in `prose-baseline.ts`.

 * The `workflows` surface: `actionlint` over the changed workflow files, plus the repo's own

 *
 * `actionlint` is not a repo dependency anywhere — CI typically installs a pinned tarball at job
 * time — so a tree that lacks it is the ordinary case, not a broken one. It is therefore run when
 * present and **disclosed** when absent, which is the "degrade, stated" answer `SKILL.md`'s
 * missing-surface table gives for an absent superseding authority: the gate workflow's `actionlint` job still
 * decides. A declared validator is the other row of that table — it ships with the repo, so one that
 * cannot be spawned is fail-loud, UNKNOWN, never green.
 *
 * What holds both readings honest is per-file coverage, not a count of validators that ran. Only
 * `actionlint` is handed the changed paths; a declared guard reads the fixed set it names in `reads`.
 * So a changed workflow file counts as opened only when `actionlint` ran over it or a passing
 * declared validator names it; every other changed workflow is reported in `unvalidated`, and a run
 * that opened **none** of them refuses UNKNOWN — that green would be the unread-tree green the
