/**
 * The one door every externally-authorable byte a `build` verb returns passes through.
 *
 * Issue bodies, comment bodies, PR bodies, review findings — anything a party other than this process
 * wrote — is gated here before it reaches stdout. **Today the gate is provenance-stamping
 * pass-through: it changes no byte.** That is deliberate, not unfinished. The trust posture is an open
 * founder decision, and this module exists so that ruling lands as one module change covering
 * every verb at once, instead of an edit to five verbs that ships four of them.
 *
 * **TOCTOU is handled by construction, not by a cache invalidation rule.** No verb holds gated content
 * across invocations: every invocation re-fetches and re-gates, so a change to the posture below is in
 * force on the very next read. Nothing here memoizes, and nothing should.
 *
 * The provenance stamp is the part that is load-bearing *now*. A caller that has a {@link Gated} in
 * hand can say where the bytes came from without re-deriving it from the call site, which is what lets
 * a future posture refuse by origin rather than by pattern.
