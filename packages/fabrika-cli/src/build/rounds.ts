/**
 * How many repair rounds a PR has been through, counted by the heads its FAIL markers name.
 *
 * A round is one graded head, not one span of wall-clock time. Every gate writes the head SHA it
 * inspected into its marker, so every FAIL at one head is one round however far apart the gates
 * post, and the count moves only when a new head is pushed and graded.
 *
 * The rule used to be a 120-second cluster over `created_at`, which counted gate latency as repair
 * effort: two gates grading one head 8 minutes apart read as two rounds, so a PR burned its cap at
 * twice the real rate and escalated with rounds left. The inclusive-gap boundary belonged to that
 * rule and now governs only the head-less fallback below.
 *
 * Heads are matched the way a verdict is bound to one — `sameHead`'s prefix rule in
 * `../wire/marker-line.ts` — so an abbreviated SHA and the full SHA it abbreviates are one round.
 *
 * **A FAIL whose head is unreadable is counted, never dropped.** It cannot join a head's round, so
 * the head-less FAILs cluster among themselves by {@link ROUND_GAP_MS} and those clusters are added
 * to the head count. Under-counting here would hand a lane repair rounds nobody granted. A comment
 * whose marker does not parse at all is a different fact and stays out of the count: it is not a
 * proven FAIL, and the repair loop does not act on one either.
