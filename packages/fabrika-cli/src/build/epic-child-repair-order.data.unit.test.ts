/**
 * The epic-child standing-`FAIL` entry is executable data in the checked-in build skill: it must name
 * the mechanized `build resume-child`, and it must not spell the sequence back out beside it.
 *
 * This pin used to assert the six-command order the skill listed. That is exactly what it could not
 * enforce — a resumed builder read the corrected order, ran the armed proof first anyway, and parked
 * the epic while this test was green. The order now lives in `./resume-child-verb.ts`, under
 * executable coverage in `./resume-child-verb.unit.test.ts`; what is
 * left for a data test is the one claim a data test can make, that the skill routes to the verb
 * rather than back to the pieces.
