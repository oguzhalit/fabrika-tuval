/**
 * The GitHub reads and writes the `build` verbs need beyond what `io/issues.ts` and `io/pulls.ts`
 * already serve.
 *
 * The house disciplines hold unchanged across the move off `gh`: REST and **never GraphQL**,
 * **every list read pages**, *proven absent* split from *unreadable*, and a shape that is not what
 * was asked for treated as a failure rather than an empty result. The pagination is the one this
 * group most depends on — a truncated bucket is the un-paginated scar these verbs exist to close,
 * and a candidate pool that silently stops at 100 answers "no p0s".
 *
 * What the transport changed is where two of those facts come from, not what they mean. The 404 that
 * makes an answer `Absent` is now the response's own status rather than `(HTTP 404)` scraped out of
 * a `gh` error string, and a paged read's completeness is now the `Link` header's exhaustion rather
 * than a scan for unaccounted bytes on a killed `gh`'s stdout. Both are still values the caller
 * refuses on.
