/**
 * `build retire` — take back the checkout an orphaned build worktree is holding, where a license
 * reaches it: the board's two, or, on a lane no claim marker holds any more, proof the tree
 * carries nothing.
 *
 * The residue this clears: a session dies mid-round, its worktree stays registered holding
 * the lane branch, and `build branch --resume-lane` then refuses on `11` rather than rename the
 * branch out from under a live checkout. Nothing inside the loop could clear it, so every such round
 * ended as a human park on a cleanup carrying no judgment.
 *
 * The order is the contract:
 *
 *   1. `git worktree prune` drops registrations whose directory is already gone.
 *   2. The worktrees holding this number's lane branches are read (`./git.ts`), and the tree this
 *      process is standing in is excluded — a checkout cannot be pulled out from under its own run.
 *   3. The board is read once: the ticket's state, and the ACL-checked claim and adopt markers.
 *   4. {@link classify} seats each subject. **Nothing is removed on a `Hold`**, and a read that
 *      failed refuses on `11` rather than resolve to either verdict. A subject the board licenses
 *      nothing about and no live claim holds comes back `Unclaimed`, and {@link residue} then reads
 *      what that one tree carries for the no-claim arm — only that one, so the two board licenses
 *      still ask git nothing about the tree.
 *   5. Each released tree is **salvaged then removed**, in that order and never with `--force`:
 *      uncommitted work goes onto the tree's own branch first, so ignoring dirtiness
 *      costs nobody their only copy. A tree the harness locked is unlocked just before its plain
 *      remove, on the strength of that same `Release` verdict: the lock is a harness artifact, not
 *      content, and a plain remove still refuses a tree holding anything unaccounted for. A removal
 *      that still refuses is reported for a human.
 *   6. Every removal is read back off a second `worktree list` — a removal this verb reports is one
 *      it proved, never one `git` exited 0 on.
 *
 * It removes the tree and leaves the branch: the repair lane the pin refused needs exactly that ref.
 *
 * **A worktree-isolated caller may run this**, which is what moves the cleanup obligation off the
 * primary-checkout driver: the harness rule that refused a cross-worktree `git` reads the typed
 * command, so it binds a shell and not a verb's own child process.
