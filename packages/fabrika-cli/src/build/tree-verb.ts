/**
 * `build tree` — the ground, proven from git state and one whole lane relationship, and never repaired.
 *
 * Two assertions, each with its own code so a caller can act on which one failed: a clean tree at a
 * `--require-clean` open (`13`), and a checked-out branch carrying this claim's nonce (`14`). A fresh
 * proof binds one issue branch to that issue's claim. A repair proof additionally binds the resumed
 * branch to the named PR, that PR's winning claim, and the explicitly requested issue in its live
 * body's served-issue set.
 * Both are location-neutral — where the lane runs is the operator's call, not fabrika's. It
 * reads and never repairs: no clean, no create, no remove.
 *
 * The skill re-runs this before every git mutation because the shell's cwd resets between calls, so a
 * pass here is a fact about *this* invocation and nothing later.
