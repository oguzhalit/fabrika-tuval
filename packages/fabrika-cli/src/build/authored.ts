/**
 * The guard over **authored** text — the bytes the caller just wrote — for `build pr`, `build note`

 *
 * An unread pipe cannot prove empty input. A body that is a path cannot be repaired by
 * rewriting a leaked path inside it, so the two refusals must stay distinct.
 *
 * **The predicates are the shipped `report/leaks.ts` ones, imported** — a second leak predicate that
 * drifts from the first is worse than either alone. Only the message wording is this group's.
