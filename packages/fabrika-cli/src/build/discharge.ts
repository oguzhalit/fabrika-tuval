/**
 * The assembly-branch discharge, derived once for every seam that gates on `blocked_by`.
 *
 * [`./blockedness.ts`](./blockedness.ts) reads the board's answer and [`./landed.ts`](./landed.ts)
 * reads the epic run's own commits; this module is the one place the second is allowed to move the
 * first. In an epic run a child's issue stays open until the single tail PR merges, so inside a run
 * in flight "the blocker is closed" answers a different question from "the blocker's work landed",
 * and only the second is the one a dependency gate means.
 *
 * It exists because `build eligible` and the claim seam once each carried their own answer: eligible
 * discharged a landed edge and claim refused it on 16, so every sequential epic tracer after the
 * first parked at a human until someone deleted the graph edge by hand. `build pick` was the third
 * answer to the same edge — it counted the child `blocked` in its excluded histogram, so a buildable
 * child read as unavailable to anyone reading the pool.
 *
 * **Discharge moves an answer only toward admitting.** An unreadable branch, an unnameable trunk and
 * a standalone issue all leave every edge exactly as the board read it, so a gate can never admit on
 * evidence it failed to read.
