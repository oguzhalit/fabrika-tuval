/**
 * The exempt-lane ruling, enforced against the skills instead of only written down.
 *
 * The planning and gating lanes are exempt from the `ready-for:agent` audience fence, and the
 * sanctioned route is `--purpose`, never `--override`. Nothing types that: each lane's claim is a
 * shell line inside a markdown skill, so `plan-epic` shipped a bare `fabrika build claim` for a
 * whole release while `audienceAxisBinds` was already exempting `plan` — the CLI was right and the
 * instruction the agent actually executes was wrong. These are data tests over the real skill files,
 * so dropping the flag turns the suite red.
