/**
 * "This tree, on this branch, is my lane" — the precondition `tree --issue`, `check`, `push` and `pr`
 * share, guarded identically so a sibling verb cannot take the same ground on weaker evidence.
 *
 * Two facts in one order, each proven before the next is asked: a branch whose **name** parses as a
 * lane (`14`), and a claim on that lane's number held by *the lane the branch names* (`15` / `11`).
 *
 * The second is the one that makes the first worth having. A branch that merely *looks* like a lane
 * proves nothing; the branch's nonce is passed in as the asking lane's identity, so the branch name and
 * the live claim have to agree on the same UUID — which is what a second lane of the same session
 * cannot fake. When the winner is another lane of this same session the refusal is re-mapped to `14`:
 * inside one session that is a wrong tree to be standing in, not a wrong session.
