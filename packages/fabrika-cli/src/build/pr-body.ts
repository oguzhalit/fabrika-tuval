/**
 * The mechanical guards over an authored PR body. *Authoring* stays the skill's; these check shape.
 *
 * Four defects, each with a scar behind it:
 *
 * - **A `## Deviations` section the review gate cannot read**. The check blocks rather
 *   than warns, and "None." counts while silence does not — the verb can force the author to *write*,
 *   never to be honest, so the section's truth stays the skill's problem and its shape is this one's.
 *   The shape itself is not restated here: it is `../wire/deviations.ts`, the same registered format
 *   `review deviations` reads, so a body this verb accepts cannot fail that gate as malformed.
 * - **A `## Report` section the review gate cannot read**. Most bodies owe no report, so an absent
 *   section passes; one that reaches for the heading and misses is refused here, through
 *   `../wire/report.ts`, the same registered format `review report` reads.
 * - **A stray closing keyword**. One closing line, aimed at this PR's own issue; a second
 *   aimed anywhere else auto-closed an issue the PR did not fix.
 * - **A classification claim**. CODEOWNERS decides control-plane membership at the merge gate
 *   and triage decides type and priority; a body asserting either is a second answer to a gated
 *   question, and a false one shipped.
 *
 * **The classification pattern set is closed on purpose.** Two implementers must ship the same guard,
 * and "refuse any spelling of it" is two guards. Fences, block quotes and inline-code spans are
 * excluded before matching, so a body that *quotes* a classification to discuss it, or names a path or
 * handle that happens to contain one (`control-plane-paths/`, `@acme/control-plane`), is not
 * refused for the quotation. That reach is the same for all three patterns: a `type:` or `p0` inside
 * backticks escapes the guard too.
