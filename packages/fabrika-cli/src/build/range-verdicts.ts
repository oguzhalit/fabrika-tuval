/**
 * Whether an epic child already carries a reviewed build — the fact the claim path could not see.
 *
 * An epic child opens no pull request, so its review lands as range-bound comments on the child
 * issue itself — the one surface neither `build eligible` (which reads the `blocked_by` graph) nor
 * `build claim` (which reads claim markers) ever looked at. A child whose newest verdict was `FAIL`
 * therefore passed both gates and was handed to a fresh lane as ordinary work, which built a second,
 * independent implementation of a criterion the FAIL already named.
 *
 * The fold is `lane prove`'s, deliberately: newest write stamp wins per namespace, so a `FAIL`
 * upserted after a `PASS` still wins. What it does **not** do is ask whether the claim still binds.
 * That question needs the range's content digest, which needs the child's branch in this tree
 * (`../lane/range.ts`), and a claim has no tree yet — but more than that, staleness is the wrong
 * question here. "Does this verdict still bind" is what a repair lane asks before it re-reviews;
 * "has this child been built and reviewed at all" is what a *fresh* claim asks, and a stale `FAIL`
 * answers that one yes — so does a `PASS`, which is why the fresh claim refuses on either.
 *
 * A comment reaching for the range format and missing it is reported separately, never dropped and
 * never folded into `standing`: a verdict posted in a broken format is the one failure that would
 * otherwise present as "the reviewer never ran". Reporting it is all this module does — the claim
 * path refuses on it (`./claim-verb.ts`), because a gate that counted the break and then admitted
 * the claim anyway would resolve unreadable to "no prior build", which is that same failure wearing
 * a stderr line.
