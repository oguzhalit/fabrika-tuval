/**
 * `build branch` — cut, or resume, the lane's nonce branch off a **freshly fetched** base.
 *
 * The lane-identity rule lives in `lane.ts`; this verb is where a name that obeys it first comes into
 * existence. Create mode cuts `build/<number>-<slug>-<nonce>` off `FETCH_HEAD` — never a local
 * remote-tracking ref, which can predate the base the lane needs. **Which base that is, create mode
 * derives**: an epic child is cut off its run's assembly branch `epic/<parent>` and a standalone
 * issue off the trunk `resolveTrunk` names, with an explicit `--base` honoured verbatim over either — see
 * {@link resolveBase} for the silent wrong base that derivation removes. Resume mode checks the
 * PR's head branch out under the **local** name `build/pr-<pr>-<nonce>` with its upstream pointed at
 * the remote head, so `build push` updates the PR while the local name carries *this* repair claim's
 * nonce — which is what stops a dead earlier lane from pinning this one.
 *
 * `--resume-lane` is resume mode for the one artifact with no PR to resume — an epic child. It
 * re-keys the branch a prior lane built the child on to this claim's nonce rather than
 * cutting a second one off it, because two branches carrying one child's commits is the underivable
 * range `lane prove` refuses on, and that refusal cannot be cleared from inside a worktree.
 *
 * A re-run is idempotent, **and proves the base before it takes the shortcut**: the nonce is a
 * function of the claim, so the second run resolves the same name — and then reads that branch's
 * merge base with the base it just fetched, refusing on `36` unless the branch carries it. Switching
 * blind is what made the idempotent re-run unable to be the recovery for a wrong first cut. Either
 * way create mode names the base commit it ended on, so a builder proves the cut off this verb's own
 * output rather than off a `git merge-base` of their own.
 *
 * Every mode asks {@link assertMovable} before it fetches, switches, renames or creates anything:
 * a dirty tree it would carry work off refuses on `13`, a tree on another lane's branch on `14`.
