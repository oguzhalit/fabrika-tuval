/**
 * `build resume-child` — an epic child's standing-`FAIL` repair entry, as one operation.
 *
 * The five steps a child repair opens with are ordered, and until now the order lived in prose: claim
 * the repair lane, re-prove that claim, prove the generic checkout clean, re-key and check out the
 * branch the prior lane built, and only then arm the lane-identity proof. A resumed builder that ran
 * the armed `tree --issue` before `branch --resume-lane` had its own generic checkout refused on exit
 * `14` and parked the whole epic — the cost a documented order can always carry.
 *
 * It sequences and derives nothing. Every step is the verb a builder would have typed, called through
 * the same `run*` function the CLI calls, so each refusal keeps its own exit code, its own words and
 * its own fail-closed reading; this module adds only the line naming which step stopped. `--cites`
 * rides along on that same principle: the claim step's decision arm is the one admission a child
 * repair can need, so the value is carried to it unchanged and judged only there.
