/**
 * The admission test both `build` seams run — **three named axes composed, never one widened term**
 * (`claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/build/contract.md`, the admission test).
 *
 * No campaign state is an axis. A `## Campaigns` row groups work under a theme and a milestone, and
 * nothing here reads its `State` cell to refuse a lane. The table's parse still lives in this module
 * because `campaign`, `triage homes` and the writers bind to it.
 *
 * - **The audience axis** is who the work is for (`ready-for:agent`). This module *hosts* it; it
 *   does not redefine it. It refuses on {@link AUDIENCE_NOT_AGENT}.
 * - **The type axis** is whether the deliverable is a pull request at all. It refuses on
 *   {@link TYPE_NOT_BUILDABLE}, and it lives here rather than in the pool because the pool is the
 *   browse path: a number handed straight to `claim` passes through no pool, so a type rule fenced
 *   only there is no fence.
 * - **The criteria axis** is whether the body carries a contract to build against. It refuses on
 *   {@link NO_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA}, and it is here for exactly the reason the type axis is: the pool
 *   held it privately, so `build issue <n>` built a no-AC issue the pool would have refused and the
 *   review gate was the first thing to catch it.
 *
 * They are siblings with different remedies — re-label the audience, take the work to the skill whose
 * lane it is, or repair the issue body — so they stay separately named, separately seated and
 * separately reported everywhere. A single predicate answering all three questions at once is the
 * shape the contract's repair round removed; every outcome below therefore carries **every** axis
 * verdict, so a caller can never lose one behind another.
 *
 * A claim's {@link ClaimPurpose} rides **beside** those axes: it decides which of them *bind* this
 * claim, and it never enters any axis's own reading.
 *
 * The core is pure and total, and this module is **imported** by the pool and claim seams rather than
 * invoked through a relaying verb — the wrapper shape is banned; this module derives the verdict, it
 * does not relay one. Nothing here touches IO.
