/**
 * The **committed-file** leak scanner behind `build check`'s prose validators — the gated surface,
 * as distinct from `report/leaks.ts`, which guards runtime issue bodies nothing else covers.
 *
 * The two surfaces want different answers, and `build check` used to ask the body scanner about a
 * file in a diff. Three divergences followed, all of them live:
 *
 *  1. **Segment class.** The body scanner's path segment permits regex punctuation, so a bare home
 *     marker followed by an alternation bar inside a fenced code block parses as a path. Here a
 *     segment must be name-shaped, so a quoted regex literal is not a path.
 *  2. **Surface scoping.** Temp/scratch roots (`/tmp/…`, `/var/folders/…`) are a *comment*-surface
 *     rule: a public comment has no legitimate bare-`/tmp` example, a doc does. This scanner carries
 *     the home/absolute arm alone.
 *  3. **Self-exemption.** A doc whose subject IS path hygiene must spell the shapes out. That set is
 *     repo policy, so it is read from `.fabrika.jsonc`, not compiled in here (see `repo-config.ts`).
 *
 * **Why the shapes are re-declared, and what keeps them honest.** A host repo's own `leak-guard`
 * may own the authoritative gate, but a fabrika verb may never shell out to the host repo's CLI,
 * and fabrika installs into repos that ship no such CLI at all, so neither side can derive the
 * shapes from the other. What stands in for the import: the canonical bytes are
 * committed as the golden fixture `__fixtures__/doc-leak-patterns.golden.json`, and each side pins
 * it in a test of its own — `doc-leak-patterns.golden.test.ts` here, and
 * `fabrika-doc-leak-conformance.test.ts` on the gate's side, which reads this fixture. Drift on
 * either side reds. The fixture pins regex source and flags; the `reason` strings below are this
 * scanner's own report text and deliberately are not shared vocabulary.
 *
 * The scars carried across, each already paid for once upstream:
 *
 *  - The `(?<![A-Za-z]:)` drive-letter carve-out on the `/Users/` arm: a Windows file URL
 *    (`file:///C:/Users/ci/…`) is not a macOS home leak, and flagging it blocked legitimate PRs.
 *  - The `~/.claude` arm's two negative lookaheads: `~/.claude.json` and `~/.claude/settings.json`
 *    are the claude CLI's public, machine-agnostic config *files*, byte-identical everywhere, and
 *    every MCP-registration doc names them. Any deeper descent or longer name still flags. The
 *    carve-out is a property of the shape, never a membership list.
 *  - The generic sibling-clone arm matches `~/<root>/<host.tld>/<user>/<repo>` by **lookahead**, so
 *    the matched span is the home prefix only — the same span the `~/code/` arm reports.
 *
 * Every arm is a generic structural shape. None of them names an operator, a machine or a repo.
