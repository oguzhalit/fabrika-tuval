/**
 * `build pick` — the ranked candidate pool. A filter over a paged listing; the *choice* stays the
 * skill's.
 *
 * The filter is fail-closed on every axis, and two of them are negative tests rather than positive
 * ones:
 *
 * - **The admission test decides all three axes** — type, audience, criteria — imported from
 *   [`./scope-admission.ts`](./scope-admission.ts) and re-derived nowhere. An issue with no
 *   `ready-for:` label is excluded — absence is an unknown audience, never an agent audience. No
 *   campaign state excludes anything. Two of those axes used to be this file's private business,
 *   and both leaked the same way: the type set as a private constant, which is how a
 *   directly-handed `type:decision` reached `claim` with nothing to refuse it, and the criteria
 *   read as a private call, which is how `build issue <n>` built a no-AC issue this pool would have
 *   refused.
 * - **Any assignee excludes.** Assignment is the one attribute that keeps a human's live document out
 *   of an agent's pool.
 * - **A candidate with an open, undischarged `blocked_by` edge excludes**, on the same channel, read
 *   off the native graph and nothing else, minus what the parent epic's assembly branch already
 *   carries — one derivation in [`./discharge.ts`](./discharge.ts), shared with the claim seam so
 *   the pool and the claim cannot state different facts about one edge. It runs last
 *   because it is the only axis that costs a network call, and an unreadable graph excludes the
 *   candidate with its reason on stderr — the whole pool is not refused for one edge list, but a
 *   candidate whose blockedness is UNKNOWN is never offered. It runs in rank order and stops once
 *   `--limit` candidates survive, so a candidate ranked past that point is never graph-read: it is
 *   counted as `unread`, in neither the pool nor the `excluded` histogram.
 *
 * **Bets come first.** When the repository keeps a table project, the issues bet on at the table in
 * force lead the pool in agenda order (`../table/bets.ts`), and everything else follows in the
 * order below. It is an order and never a filter: a bet still passes every axis above, and an issue
 * nobody bet on is still offered. With no table project the pool is exactly the order below.
 *
 * **Either every bucket was read in full, or the answer is `11`.** v1's pool printed nothing for a
 * failed bucket and kept going, so a `gh` 5xx on the p0 bucket read as "no p0s"
 * (`step1-candidate-pool.sh:12-13`); a bucket whose paginated output stops mid-page is the same fact
 * and lands on the same code. A table project the repository adopted and that could not be read
 * refuses the whole pool too — a pool ranked as if nothing were bet on, when bets exist, is an order
 * nobody chose. A token without the `project` scope is the one exception: the bet order is a
 * preference, so the pool keeps its own order and one stderr line names the fix. An empty pool is
 * still a fact. No skill consumes individual excluded issues, so the evidence is bounded through
 * ../evidence.ts. See ./command.ts help for the pool answer.
