/**
 * The guarded writes over a PR body: `build pr` opens one, `build pr-body` rewrites an open one, and
 * `build push` runs `build pr`'s guards and create through {@link vetBody} and {@link openLanePull}
 * so a build round pushes and opens in one step.
 *
 * @ruling https://github.com/kamp-us/phoenix/issues/6933#issuecomment-5519864602
 *
 * *Authoring* stays the skill's; the guards here are mechanical and run **in order, all before any
 * write**: stdin non-empty (`3`), no machine-local path (`5` / `6`), body shape (`4`), no
 * classification claim (`10`), then the claim and the target issue (`15` / `11` / `7`). The ordering
 * is the point — a body that would be refused should be refused before a PR exists to carry it.
 *
 * An already-open PR for this head branch is an **answer**, not an error: a create whose outcome could
 * not be proven (`8`) is re-run, and the re-run must not open a second PR.
 *
 * Both verbs live in one module because they must guard identically. `build pr-body` exists so a FAIL
 * whose whole fix is a body edit — the recurring one is a `## Deviations` section the review gate reads
 * as malformed — has a route that runs the guards, instead of a raw `gh` call that runs none.
 * It reorders one step and nothing else: it cannot name the served issue until it has read the PR, so
 * the two issue-dependent guards (`4`, and the closing-keyword half of it) sit after that read — still
 * before any write, which is the invariant the ordering is for.
