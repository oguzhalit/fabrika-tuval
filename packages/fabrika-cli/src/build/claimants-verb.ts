/**
 * `build claimants` — who holds the claim on this number, asked by a caller holding none.
 *
 * The protocol's three ownership verbs all ask about the asking lane: `confirm` re-proves this
 * lane's claim and takes a token that must belong to this session, so a driver arriving after a
 * session limit killed its builders cannot use it to inspect the numbers those dead lanes left
 * claimed — and `claim` would answer only by racing a marker of its own, which is a write.
 * This asks the board and reports, and it is the whole of what it does.
 *
 * **It clears nothing.** No TTL, no lease, no steal, and no eviction inferred from absence: a
 * stranded claim passes to a successor through a written `build adopt` and leaves through
 * `build release`. So this verb's answer is a list a driver acts on, never an act.
 *
 * A closed issue is reported rather than refused, unlike the rest of the group's `openIssue` fold:
 * the question here is answerable on a closed thread, and a claim marker outliving the issue it was
 * taken on is precisely the strandedness this verb is for. Absent is still `7` — there is no thread
 * to read — and unreadable is still `11`.
