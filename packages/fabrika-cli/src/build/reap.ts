/**
 * The reclamation predicate `build reap` turns on: may this finished agent worktree be removed?
 *
 * Pure, and separated from the verb because the whole rule lives here. A removal takes the checkout
 * and leaves every ref, so what it can lose is exactly two things: a path nobody committed, and a
 * commit no branch, remote-tracking ref or tag reaches. The arms run in one order, and the first
 * that answers seats the tree:
 *
 *   1. {@link classifyCheap} — the run's own tree, a tree that reads live, a locked one, and one
 *      whose directory or liveness could not be read are KEEP. A registration whose directory is
 *      gone is `Prune`: there is no checkout to be unsafe about, so the sweep clears the record.
 *   2. A clean tree the trunk already carries is `Remove`, on `../io/containment.ts`'s answer.
 *   3. A clean tree whose every commit a ref reaches is `Remove`: nothing in it dies with the
 *      checkout, whether or not the trunk carries it.
 *   4. What is left holds something a removal would lose, and only the board can release it: a tree
 *      whose branch or pull request is **proven** merged or closed is `Remove`, whatever it holds.
 *   5. Everything else is KEEP, and the reason names what it holds and what could not be proven.
 *
 * **A read that failed proves nothing.** An unreadable status, an unreadable ref count, a board that
 * did not answer, and a tree holding no branch to ask the board about are all KEEP. Arm 4 is the
 * only arm that overrides what a tree holds, and it never reaches a tree arm 1 kept.
 *
 * The liveness arm is not a git fact, and it is here because the git facts are blind to a whole
 * class of tree. An operator or reviewer seat drives its lane without ever committing and usually
 * without editing a file, so its HEAD sits on the trunk and its status is clean for its entire life
 * — the exact shape the git facts read as "carries nothing". One such seat was removed mid-drive, so
 * {@link Liveness} carries whatever the sweep could observe about the tree still being in use, and
 * any live **or unreadable** signal is a KEEP.
 *
 * The trunk's answer about a tree's HEAD is `../io/containment.ts`'s {@link Containment}, shared
 * with `lane assembly`'s resume guard. The subject there is the **commit**, not a branch name,
 * because most of the leaked population holds no branch at all: the harness detaches the trees it
 * registers, so a rule keyed on a branch would classify 52 of this clone's 74 agent trees as
 * unjudgeable and reclaim none of them.
 *
 * `./retire.ts` asks the board about one number an operator named. This module asks about a branch
 * nobody named, and it reads a pull request closed unmerged as finished, where `./retire.ts` does
 * not.
