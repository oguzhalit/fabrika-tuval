/**
 * The cleared repair rounds recorded on a PR — the read `build verdicts` folds and `build clear`
 * re-reads before granting another.
 *
 * A `cap-cleared` marker is bytes, and bytes are not authority. A row is **honoured** only when all
 * four clauses hold, the same conjunctive shape `grill rule` records a ruling under:
 *
 *   1. the marker parses, and names a round at or past the declared cap;
 *   2. its author is in the repo's control-plane set — the owners `.github/CODEOWNERS` names on the
 *      default branch, teams expanded — the same set `plan approve` and `decision rule` read;
 *   3. that same author holds `write+` on the repo, read live from GitHub's ACL;
 *   4. a dated authorization comment sits immediately before it, from that same author, and is not
 *      itself a `cap-cleared` marker.
 *
 * Clause 3 intersects the two: CODEOWNERS says whom the repo *nominates*, and the ACL says who may
 * actually act, so a login with no collaboration clears nothing. The set used to be `.fabrika.jsonc`'s
 * `capClearAuthors`; that key is now ignored, and a clearing verb names it in a notice when a repo
 * still declares it.
 *
 * Every miss is a row carrying its reason rather than a dropped marker: an operator who posted a
 * void grant must be able to see it was void, and a silently dropped one reads as a PR nobody ever
 * cleared.
 *
 * A read that could not complete — the config, a team's membership — is `Unknown`, never an empty
 * set. Resolving an unreadable ACL to "nobody granted" would be safe for the budget and wrong for
 * the answer, and resolving it the other way would hand out authority nobody proved.
