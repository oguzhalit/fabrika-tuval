/**
 * `build verdicts` — the paginated, per-gate verdict fold on a PR, at its live head.
 *
 * Three properties the repair loop rests on:
 *
 * - **A stale marker is visible AS stale, never dropped.** "The FAIL is old" and "there is no FAIL"
 *   are different facts, and folding them is how a FAIL'd PR reads as unreviewed.
 *
 * - **Staleness is the content question**, decided by `bindToContent` off the head digest
 *   `../review/head-content.ts` resolves — the same derivation `ship gate` reads. This verb tells a
 *   builder "your verdicts are void, re-review"; the gate decides whether the PR may merge, and the
 *   two answering one marker differently spent a lane a repair round nobody had found a defect in.
 * - **Native reviews are their own row kind**, never coerced into markers. Whether a
 *   `CHANGES_REQUESTED` with no marker drives a repair is still undecided; this verb reports the
 *   state honestly and pre-rules nothing.
 * - An unreadable page cannot prove there are no verdicts. See ./command.ts help for the answer.
 *
 * - **Mergeability is folded beside the rows**, because a PR conflicting against its base is repair
 *   work no gate emits a FAIL for: without the field, an all-PASS fold over a conflicting PR is the
 *   proven-no-work answer the Repair section routes on, and the lane leaves the PR stranded.
 *   The platform's uncomputed read stays `unknown` all the way out — folded as clean it rebuilds the
 *   bug behind a field that looks like it fixed it.
 *
 * - **`requiredChecks` is folded beside mergeability for the same reason** (`./required-checks.ts`):
 *   a reviewer's PASS can land before CI settles red, and an all-PASS fold over a red required check
 *   read as nothing to fix. An unreadable CI read is `unknown` on the field and never refuses the
 *   fold, because the gate rows are still proven.
 *
 * - **`capReached` is the declared cap plus what the founder cleared, never a second constant.** A
 *   recorded clearance (`./clearances.ts`) buys the one round it names, so the field the Repair
 *   section tells a builder to trust stays the only budget number anyone reads.
 *
 * - **`escalatedFindings` is the reader fence 3's escalation comment never had.** A finding raised
 *   at or past the acceptance-criteria freeze becomes a tagged comment and no criterion
 *   (`../review/append-criterion-verb.ts`), so a repair round dispatched past the freeze read a
 *   contract that did not contain the round it was there to repair — and only a driver hand-writing
 *   the comment id into a spawn prompt connected the two ends. Folded here, the round reads
 *   it through the one door it already opens.
 *
 * Every row's `body` is the finding's full text through the content gate — the repair loop consumes
 * findings from here and never raw-fetches a comment, which is what keeps the one-door property over
 * the repair path. `escalatedFindings` carries its comment's body the same way, for the same reason.

 * over a child's standing `FAIL`, and a lane sent to repair needs the findings through a verb rather
 * than a raw fetch. The rows carry the range each verdict was formed over instead of a head,
 * and a round is one graded tip — the range analogue of one graded head, folded through the same
 * `countRounds`.
 *
 * **It folds escalated findings too**, off the same comment page the verdicts come from: a child's
 * reviewer hits the identical freeze, and the comment it escalates to lands on this issue. Every
 * escalation here was raised over this child's own range, so there is no subject to select on.
 *
 * **It reports no clearance, and says so.** A cap clearance is recorded against a PR's base branch
 * (`./clearances.ts`), and a child has no PR — so the budget here is the declared cap, unmodified,
 * and a lane that needs another round escalates to the operator rather than reading a grant that has
 * nowhere to live.
