/**
 * The `## Dependencies` grammar — canonical here, validated by `build check --surface plan` and
 * rendered into an epic ledger by `ledger topology`.
 *
 * **This block is a rendering, never a source of blockedness.** Every dependency in fabrika sits
 * behind GitHub's native `blocked_by` edges — an epic's children and a standalone issue alike — and
 * a prose block is at most a picture of them. `build eligible` therefore parses
 * nothing here — it reads the graph through `./blockedness.ts`. What still reads this
 * grammar reads it for planning and sequencing: the plan surface's well-formedness check, the
 * ledger renderer, and the epic machine emitter. A reader that wants to know whether work may start
 * asks the graph.
 *
 * **{@link requiredEdges} does not weaken that.** It reads the block to say which edges the graph
 * *owes*, so `ledger edges` can write them and the plan gate can red when the two disagree — the
 * picture is still never consulted at a build gate, and the picture is still never the thing a
 * builder waits on.
 *
 * The section holds only blank lines and list lines of two forms:
 *
 * ```
 * - phase <int>: <ref>[, <ref>…]
 * - <ref> requires: <ref>[, <ref>…]
 * ```
 *
 * where `<ref>` is `#<int>` or a ledger-local `C<int>`. An issue in phase *k* is blocked while any ref
 * in a phase below *k* is open; a `requires:` line blocks its subject while any ref it lists is open.
 *
 * **Any other non-blank line inside the section is unparseable, and unparseability refuses.** "No
 * parseable edges" is never read as "no edges" — a topology nobody could read is not a topology
 * proving nothing blocks.
 *
 * **The section ends at the next ATX heading or at the first thematic break (`---`, `***`, `___`),
 * whichever comes first** — this is the canonical statement of that boundary, and `plan/ledger.ts`
 * reads its own sections through the `isThematicBreak` exported here rather than restating it. A
 * filed body is amended by appending a dated block below the original, and that block is
 * conventionally introduced by a bare `---`; with `## Dependencies` last, a heading-only boundary
 * put that separator inside the section and refused the whole topology over a line that was never
 * part of it.
