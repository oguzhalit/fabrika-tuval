/**
 * Blockedness, read off GitHub's native `blocked_by` graph and nowhere else.
 *
 * The graph is the one carrier of "do not start this yet", for a standalone issue exactly as for an
 * epic child, and the same holds for the epic ledger's prose `## Dependencies` block: that block is
 * at most a rendering of the graph, never an input anything parses to decide behaviour. This module
 * is the one reader over that one source, so every seam that gates on blockedness starts from the
 * same read. What the epic run's assembly branch then discharges off that read is
 * [`./discharge.ts`](./discharge.ts)'s, shared by `build eligible`, the claim seam and the pool so
 * the three cannot drift again.
 *
 * **A `blocked_by` entry is not a block on its own.** The endpoint lists every blocker whatever its
 * state, so the derivation — "any blocker issue still open" — lives here, in the reader, as
 * [`../io/edges.ts`](../io/edges.ts) already says it must.
 *
 * **The read fails closed on every axis.** The edge list is `Unknown` when it 404s just
 * as when the transport failed: the caller proves the issue exists before asking, so a 404 here is
 * an unexplained answer, not "no edges". A blocker whose own state could not be read is its own
 * unread row rather than a closed one — it never shortens the blocking set, and it never seats a
 * pass on its own.
