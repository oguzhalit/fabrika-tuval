/**
 * The integrate `FAIL` standing over an epic child, read off its epic lane's ledger for `build claim`.
 *
 * A child that passed review and then failed `lane integrate` carries only `PASS` range verdicts, so
 * the comments alone read it as finished. The machine sent it back to `build` all the same, and the
 * one record of why is the `FAIL` line `lane report` wrote with the exit and assembly head on it
 * (`../lane/integrate-failure.ts`), or the `CORRECTED` line `lane attach-integrate` appended to put
 * them on a `FAIL` recorded before the pair existed. The ledger is local to the driver's machine, so the caller names
 * it — the `lane` and `root` its brief carries — and nothing here guesses a path.
