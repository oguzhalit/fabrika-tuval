/**
 * `build retire-branch` — clear the two-branch deadlock on an epic child by renaming the superseded
 * lane branches out of `build/`.
 *
 * The residue this clears: two local branches both carry one child's commits, `traceRange` answers
 * `Many`, `locateRange` maps that to `Ambiguous`, and `lane prove` refuses because which range the
 * lane built is not derivable. `build branch --resume-lane` already printed the remedy and nothing
 * performed it; this verb performs it.
 *
 * The order is the contract:
 *
 *   1. This clone's local branches are read, and `childLaneBranches` (`./lane.ts`, never a second
 *      regex) nominates exactly the candidate set `locateRange` nominates.
 *   2. Fewer than two candidates is not a deadlock: zero is `ZERO_SCOPE`, one answers `none`.
 *   3. The board's authorized claim markers are read once, and {@link supersede} seats the
 *      candidates against them. **Nothing is renamed on an `Unattested`** — a survivor nobody
 *      attests to would be a guess, and a wrong guess moves the only copy of a child's work.
 *   4. Stale worktree registrations are pruned, and no branch about to be renamed may be checked
 *      out anywhere. `renameBranch` (`./git.ts`) exits 0 on a held branch and silently retargets
 *      that worktree's `HEAD`, so skipping this proof moves a branch out from under a live lane.
 *   5. Each superseded branch is renamed into `retired/`. **No path here deletes a branch** — the
 *      commits survive, and a mistaken retirement costs a rename back rather than the work.
 *   6. Every rename is read back off a second `localBranches` — a retirement this verb reports is
 *      one it proved, never one `git` exited 0 on.
 *
 * A worktree-isolated lane may run it against a branch it never cut: every step is a read or a
 * rename in the shared ref store, and refs are common to every worktree of a clone.
