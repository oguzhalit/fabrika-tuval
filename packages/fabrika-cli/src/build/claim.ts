/**
 * The claim protocol `claim` / `confirm` / `release` share, and that every mutating verb re-runs
 * before it touches a number.
 *
 * One comment-marker race on the issue: post a marker carrying this session's token, re-read the
 * markers, and the **earliest authorized** one wins. The protocol is implemented here rather than
 * shelled out to another tool's claim helper — this module derives the verdict, it does not relay one.
 *
 * **Ownership turns on the whole token, never on the session id alone.** A session is not a lane: one
 * driver session routinely runs several builders at once, and each mints its own token. Deciding
 * `Mine` on `parsed.session === session` reads as the obvious simplification — it is indistinguishable
 * under one lane per session — and it told the second lane it held the first lane's claim, so both ran
 * the same repair and both pushed. The asking lane therefore names itself, as a {@link Caller},
 * and a same-session marker under a different nonce is `Foreign`.
 *
 * **Authorization comes from repository permissions, never from the marker's text.** A
 * marker whose author resolves below `write` is counted and reported, and never wins — otherwise the
 * race is decided by whoever is willing to type the winning string. A permission read that *fails* is
 * UNKNOWN, never a demotion: v1 silently demoted an authorized author on a transient read failure
 * (`claim/github.ts:229-231`), which hands the lane to a later claimant on a network blip.
 *
 * Three refusals stay separate, because v1 fused them and callers guessed: a proven loss is `15`, a
 * missing session id is `1`, and an unreadable marker set is `11` — never "unclaimed".
 *
 * The protocol is namespaced by a {@link ClaimGrammar} so a second kind of lane can race on the same
 * issue without colliding with a build claim; `build` reads {@link BUILD_CLAIM}, which is the default
 * everywhere, and the `lane` group reads its own (`../lane/claim.ts`).
