/**
 * `build eligible` — one issue's dependency gate, **derived from GitHub's native `blocked_by` graph
 * and nothing else**. A label is a claim and a prose block is a rendering; the graph is the fact.
 *
 * The edges are the issue's own, so the gate no longer hangs off a parent ledger: a standalone
 * issue is gated exactly like an epic child — one rule over both populations.
 * The parent is still resolved, because the assembly-branch discharge below is named from it and
 * the answer carries it.
 *
 * The dependency read lives in [`./blockedness.ts`](./blockedness.ts). An unreadable graph cannot
 * prove that no issue blocks this one. See ./command.ts help for the result and refusal codes.
 *
 * **A blocker is discharged by a closed issue OR by a landed commit** (`./discharge.ts`).
 * That derivation is shared with the claim seam, which once carried none and refused an edge this
 * verb had already discharged. An epic run's children stay open until the single tail PR merges, so
 * inside a run the closed-state proxy answers "is the issue closed" where the gate means "did the
 * work land" — and
 * reading only the first makes every later-phase child unbuildable until the epic it blocks has
 * shipped. The second source is evidence, not a skip: no assembly branch, no discharge — and the
 * evidence is only what the run added over the trunk, never the history the branch was cut from.
 *
 * **Every blocker is read before the answer is seated, so the answer does not depend on the order
 * the graph happens to list them in.** One *proven* open edge is proof of blockedness whatever else
 * could not be read, so a blocker read that failed alongside it downgrades neither the verdict nor
 * its edge list — it is named on stderr as its own unread row instead. With nothing proven open, an
 * unread blocker is `11`: the set of blocking edges is only complete when every blocker's state is
 * known.
