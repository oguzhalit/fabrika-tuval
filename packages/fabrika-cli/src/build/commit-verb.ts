/**
 * `build commit` — create this lane's commit from a message the lane authored, and prove the commit
 * carries it.
 *
 * The verb exists because the group had **no commit verb at all**, so the message-carrying path at
 * every call site was improvised and nothing asserted the message on the resulting commit. A lane
 * improvised `git commit -F <scratch leaf>`, the leaf held a two-day-old message from another lane,
 * and the commit landed claiming an issue this lane had never touched — silently, with every command
 * exiting 0.
 *
 * Three guards, each closing one half of that:
 *
 * - **The carrying path is prescribed, not improvised.** The message arrives on stdin (file-free) or
 *   in a leaf under `build scratch`'s claim-nonce-keyed directory. A hand-rolled path is refused
 *   (`10`), never tolerated — a path outside the allocator is exactly the one with no per-lane key.
 * - **The message may name only numbers this lane holds** (`4`). The borrowed message was
 *   well-formed and referenced a real issue, which is why a shape check cannot see it and a claim
 *   test can.
 * - **The message is read back off the created commit** (`9`). Everything upstream is a claim about
 *   what was *sent*; only `git log` says what git *recorded*, and the two differed in the incident.
