 * The pure read `build pr` makes over the served issue's title before it becomes the PR title.
 *
 * The incident this module answers: a repo that squash-merges with
 * `squash_merge_commit_title: COMMIT_OR_PR_TITLE`, so on a multi-commit PR the PR title becomes the
 * commit subject on `main` — and release-please cannot route a subject with no conventional prefix,
 * so the change lands with no version bump and no changelog line. Issue titles are descriptive
 * sentences; the prefix is derived here, from the served issue's `type:` label, so every builder PR
 * squashes to a subject release-please can parse.
 *
 * The second incident: a subject carrying a literal `<details>` lands in the Release PR
 * body's changelog, and release-please parses that body as HTML — a stray tag with no `<summary>`
 * crashes every later run. Angle brackets are stripped here for the same reason the prefix is added
 * here: this is the one place an issue title becomes a commit subject.
