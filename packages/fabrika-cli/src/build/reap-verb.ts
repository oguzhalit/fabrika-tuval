/**
 * `build reap` — reclaim the finished agent worktrees this clone never removed.
 *
 * The leak: the harness registers a worktree per spawned agent under `.claude/worktrees/agent-*`
 * and nothing removes one when its agent finishes, so registrations pile up until a live lane has
 * to reason about whether a dead checkout is a sibling holding its branch — a false signal sitting
 * directly upstream of a force-push decision.
 *
 * `build retire` does not cover this: that verb targets the trees holding ONE number's lane branch
 * and needs a board statement about that number to release them. A finished agent tree usually holds
 * no lane branch at all — the harness detaches it — so there is no number to ask the board about.
 * This verb asks git first, and removes what git proves loses nothing. It asks the board only about
 * a tree that holds something a removal would lose, and only when that tree stands on a branch.
 *
 * The order is the contract:
 *
 *   1. This run's own tree root is read, so no pass can remove the checkout it is standing in.
 *   2. Every registration is read whole (`./git.ts`) and narrowed to the agent population — both
 *      namings the harness provisions under, per `./reap.ts`'s `isAgentWorktree`.
 *   3. The trunk is resolved (`../io/trunk.ts`), never spelled — a wrong ref resolves to nothing
 *      and would make every tree look unlanded.
 *   4. Trees are seated **one at a time, in registration order**. Each gets one stat, and the arms
 *      answerable off that plus the registration's own fields run first ({@link classifyCheap}).
 *      What they leave open pays for the `git status`, the containment scan and the count of
 *      commits no ref reaches ({@link classifyGit}). Only a tree those leave open — one holding
 *      uncommitted paths or unreached commits — costs a board read. **Every read that fails is a
 *      KEEP**, per-tree: a sweep of seventy trees must not lose its whole answer to one unreadable
 *      directory.
 *   5. Nothing is removed at all without `--execute`. The default run seats the whole population and
 *      prints every verdict.
 *   6. Under `--execute` a tree seated `Remove` is removed **before the next tree is read**. `--limit`
 *      bounds the removals attempted, and the judging stops the moment that bound is spent: a tree
 *      past it gets the one stat that proves its directory gone and nothing else — no git read and
 *      no board read — and the ones still on disk are reported as a count. So a bounded pass costs
 *      what it takes to find that many removable trees, plus one stat a tree after that.
 *   7. Each removal runs plain `git worktree remove` — never `--force`, which is banned on every
 *      path. A tree the board released while it held uncommitted paths has them committed onto its
 *      own branch first, because git refuses to remove a dirty tree. Every removal is read back off
 *      a second `worktree list`.
 *   8. Each removal git reports is appended to {@link REAP_JOURNAL} under this run's tree root
 *      before the next tree is read, so a sweep killed mid-loop still leaves its executed set
 *      readable on disk. The read-back at 7 proves the sweep; the journal is what survives a
 *      process that never reaches it. A journal write that fails is reported and demotes nothing —
 *      the removal is the fact, the record is the convenience.
 *   9. Then the stale registrations go, in the same pass: the ones whose directory was already gone
 *      and the ones each removal just left behind. `git worktree prune` clears the record and the
 *      same read-back proves it. `--limit` does not bound this — a registration is a line in a file,
 *      not a tree to delete — which is why the stat at 6 still runs past a spent bound: a locked
 *      registration is unlocked only where that stat proved its directory gone, and prune skips a
 *      locked entry. A surviving one is reported without redding the sweep, because it costs disk
 *      nothing and risks no work.
 *
 * It removes the tree and leaves the branch, exactly as `build retire` does: a removal frees a
 * checkout, it does not delete a ref.

 * as some other tag and keeps the tree. Verified against this repo's `effect@4.0.0-beta.92` under
 * `NodeServices.layer`: a missing path answered `NotFound` and an unreadable one `PermissionDenied`.
 *
 * git's own `prunable` flag is **not** that proof and is not consulted here. Its condition is the
 * `<worktree>/.git` file, not the `<worktree>` directory, so a checkout whose `.git` file was
 * deleted while its files stayed reports prunable with uncommitted work still on disk — measured
 * against real git in `./stale-registration.git.test.ts`. Seating `Gone` off it would clear that
 * registration and delete `.git/worktrees/<id>`, taking the only ref a commit living solely in that
 * worktree has. The stat is the wider source anyway: every registration git calls prunable *because*
 * its directory is gone answers `NotFound` here, and the locked-and-gone entries git's own prune
 * skips are reached only through this read.
 *
 * The liveness signal is the worktree root's own mtime, and that tracks the root's **entry list** —
 * a create, delete or rename directly in it — not a write to a file inside it. So for a seat that
 * drives without editing, this reads the tree's provisioning time, and a young tree is one
 * provisioned recently rather than one somebody was recently active in; {@link QUIET_WINDOW_SECONDS}
 * carries the ground for that and what it costs. It is still the only liveness reading available
 * without asking the OS for process cwds.
 *
 * A clock skew that puts the mtime in the future reads Live, not Quiet: the arm's whole polarity is
 * that an answer it cannot trust must not license a removal.
