 *
 * - **A branch is cut off `FETCH_HEAD`, never off a local ref.** A checkout's remote-tracking trunk can
 *   predate the commit the lane needs, and a branch cut off it misses work that is already on the
 *   base. Every create here fetches first and cuts off what was just fetched. {@link fetchBase}
 *   takes a {@link BaseRef} rather than a ref string so the one spelling that cannot be fetched —
 *   a branch only this clone holds — is a *constructed* case with a proof behind it, not a string
 *   that falls through to a bare `git fetch` and a stale local read.
 * - **A push is believed only after the remote ref is read back.** `git push`'s own report is not
 *   evidence: a push that died mid-hook read as sent. {@link remoteSha} asks the remote
 *   directly, and the caller compares.

 *
 * Ignored files stay out; `--exclude-standard` is what keeps them out.
 *
 * `--full-name -- :/` is load-bearing on the second read: bare `ls-files --others` is cwd-scoped and
 * prints cwd-relative paths, while `git diff` is repo-wide and root-relative. Run from a
 * subdirectory the two disagree, dropping untracked files outside the cwd and handing the rest a
 * path that does not resolve against `lane.root`. The pathspec restores repo-wide, the flag
 * restores root-relative.
 *
 * The second source is the scar. `git diff` never reports an untracked path, so a
 * brand-new file was absent from the list `build check` partitions — neither validated nor named in
 * `unvalidated`, invisible instead of disclosed, while the verdict read green. The natural lane
 * order is construct, check, then commit, which is exactly the window where a new file is untracked.
 *
 * Either source failing is a failure of the whole read: a short list here becomes a green that
 * understates its own coverage, which is the fail-open direction.
