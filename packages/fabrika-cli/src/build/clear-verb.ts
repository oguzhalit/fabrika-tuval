/**
 * `build clear` — record the founder's clearance of one extra repair round on a PR.
 *
 * The clauses are conjunctive and any miss resolves to *not cleared*, never to a warning: the
 * invoking account is in the repo's control-plane set — the owners `.github/CODEOWNERS` names — AND
 * holds `write+` at GitHub's ACL, the PR is open, its budget is actually spent, and the quoted
 * authorization is present and dated. A bare stamp is void, which is why `--authorization`
 * is required rather than inferred; authority is the ACL's, which is why the control-plane set
 * narrows the ACL rather than replacing it. A `capClearAuthors` the config still declares is ignored
 * and named in a notice.
 *
 * **Write ordering is an invariant, not an implementation detail** — the same one `grill rule`
 * holds. The authorization comment lands first and the marker second: an interrupted run that wrote
 * the marker first would leave a void grant a careless reader folds as budget, while the reverse
 * leaves a quote with no marker, which resolves to nothing and grants nobody anything. The lane's
 * local bump is last, because a lane that has not heard about the grant only freezes early, and a
 * lane bumped with no marker behind it would run a round nobody granted.
 *
 * **What `cleared` proves, exactly.** That a control-plane account posted a marker naming a
 * round whose budget was spent, with a dated authorization comment beside it. It does not prove the
 * quoted authorization is a truthful record of what the founder said; nothing mechanical can, and
 * the residue is the same unclosable one `grill rule` carries. In a repo where an agent runs on
 * the founder's own token, the agent's restraint is what holds — this verb is the operator's, and
 * `build`'s Repair section tells a builder that reads a cap to escalate, never to clear it.
 *
 * **Re-running after a partial write reconciles, it does not re-grant.** Once the marker has landed,
 * the cap it raised is the reason the budget test would now say "not spent" — so a run that finds
 * this round already granted skips both the budget test and the two writes, and does the one thing
 * that is still undone: the lane's local bump. Without that branch exit `29`'s own stated remedy
 * refuses on `7` and the lane can only be unfrozen by an edit outside the loop — the hand edit this
 * branch exists to remove.
