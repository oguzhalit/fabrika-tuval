/**
 * The two halves of a base-ref answer — the merged set and the in-flight set — loaded so their
 * failures stay distinguishable.
 *
 * The halves fail differently and the difference is load-bearing:
 *
 * - **An empty merged set is a fact, not a failed read.** The read itself proves the directory:
 *   `git ls-tree <sha>:<dir>` fails outright when `<dir>` is not in the tree, so a listing that
 *   comes back empty is a directory that exists and holds nothing — a repo adopting fabrika on day
 *   one, whose first id is `0001`. Only `DirUnreadable` is UNKNOWN. The zero-scope refusal rule
 *   governs *gates* scanning for violations, where an empty scan means nothing was checked; an
 *   allocator's empty corpus is that rule's own legitimately-empty scope, which is declared
 *   explicitly rather than refused.
 * - **An empty in-flight set is a fact — but only on a successful read.** No open ADR pull request
 *   is a normal state; an in-flight set that could not be read is a refusal, because a caller that
 *   reads an empty set as "nothing reserved" falls back to the on-disk id, which is exactly the
 *   collision the fetched base ref exists to remove.
