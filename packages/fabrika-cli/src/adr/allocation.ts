/**
 * The one read that turns the decision corpus into a free id — shared by `adr next` and `adr mint`.
 *
 * It lives apart from either verb because both must fail on exactly the same reads for exactly the
 * same reasons: a second copy of this ladder is a second place for one of the five UNKNOWN branches
 * to quietly become an answer, and an allocator that answers over a half-read set mints a duplicate.
 * The caller supplies its own verb name so a refusal names the command the operator actually ran.
 *
 * Three sets, read in cost order: the base ref, then this clone's branch refs (local and
 * remote-tracking alike), then GitHub's open pull requests. The branch walk is what sees an epic child's mint before any pull request exists
 * (`branch-claims.ts`).
