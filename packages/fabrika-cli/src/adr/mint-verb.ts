/**
 * `adr mint` — allocate the next free id and scaffold its record in one invocation.
 *
 * `adr next` then `adr new` is two calls with an author's whole drafting turn between them, and an
 * id read in the first call is stale by the second: that check-to-mint gap is what puts one id on
 * two pull requests and costs a dismissed approval. Fusing the pair does not make allocation
 * atomic across lanes — nothing local can — but it removes the one window an author controls,
 * leaving only the mint-to-open window. That window is now narrower than it reads here: a mint
 * committed on a branch of *this* clone is visible to every sibling worktree's next allocation
 * before any pull request opens (`branch-claims.ts`), so what survives is two lanes in two clones.
 * A duplicate-reporting job over the batched merge ref does not close that one
 * either while it is not a required context: the batch merges anyway and the lane that opened
 * second renumbers on the default branch.
 *
 * Both halves are the existing ones: {@link resolveAllocation} is `adr next`'s read and
 * {@link scaffold} is `adr new`'s write, so this verb decides only the order and what it reports.
