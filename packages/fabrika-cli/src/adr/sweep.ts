/**
 * `adr sweep`'s ranking, pure and native to fabrika.
 *
 * It ranks the uncited live-accepted records whose decision domain the subject touches, by a
 * lexical/rarity score: a term shared with the subject is worth its inverse document frequency
 * over the live-accepted corpus, so a term every ADR uses ("the", "gate", "pipeline") contributes
 * almost nothing and a term two ADRs share contributes a lot.
 *
 * None of the outcomes is a clearance, which is why `no-overlap` is a distinct token rather than an
 * empty shortlist: an ADR that disagrees with the subject about what a *label means*, sharing no
 * distinctive vocabulary, never appears at all, and the skill reads the domain by hand regardless.
