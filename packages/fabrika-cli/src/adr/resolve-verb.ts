/**
 * `adr resolve` — resolve ids to their real filename and state against a fetched base ref.
 *
 * `live` and `landed` split presence from authority, and the split is the point: presence alone is
 * what a caller wrongly reads as citable, and a corpus of any size carries records that are present
 * and not live. `in-flight` is a distinct state so a caller can refuse to cite a pull request that
 * may never merge, and the `detail` column carries the frontmatter `status:` verbatim so a withdrawn or
 * superseded record reads as such at the moment of citation.
 *
 * The filename is printed rather than derived: a slug is not derivable from a title — a record
 * titled "one merge authority" can be filed as `ship-it-merge-actor` — so a guessed slug is a dead
 * link.
