/**
 * The two shapes an evidence-array collapses to before it reaches the answer channel.
 *
 * A verb's output field is either an **answer-array** — a skill instructs its reader to iterate the
 * rows — or an **evidence-array**, cited only so a short or empty answer is auditable, with no skill
 * reading its rows by name. Answer-arrays stay whole. An evidence-array collapses here: to a reason
 * histogram when its rows carry a small fixed vocabulary, or to a cap-and-count when they do not.
 *
 * It lives beside `./verb.ts` rather than inside it because that module owns the answer channel and
 * takes an already-serialized string; shaping the payload happens before serialization and is a
 * different concern. The five private tallies in the package (`spend/rollup.ts`, `ci/changelog.ts`,
 * `map/frontier.ts`, `governance/roots.ts`, `review/classes.ts`) are each shape-specific and stay
 * where they are — none is generic over rows plus a key function.
 *
 * Both functions are pure and total, so a collapse is as testable as the rows it replaces.
 */

 * Tally `rows` by the reason `keyOf` reads off each one.
 *
 * **Key order is count-descending, ties broken by reason ascending — never insertion order.** The
 * histogram is serialized straight into a JSON payload, where key order is the byte order a reader
 * and a golden fixture both see; deriving it from the rows would make the same tally print two ways
 * depending on which issue the board listed first.
 *
 * An empty `rows` gives `{}`, which is the honest answer — a caller reads "no rows were excluded"
 * off it exactly as it would off an empty array.
