/**
 * Which exit tables in this package must agree, what "agree" means, and the derivation that decides
 * it — read from the shipped modules' own exports, never from a copied list of numbers.
 *
 * `exit-codes.ts` is the **base**: the shared registry every aligning group reads its common seats
 * from, `report` included. An aligning group owes the base two things, and they are different
 * obligations that need different machinery:
 *
 *   - **The shared seats carry the same number.** Handled by identity, not by assertion: an aligning
 *     group *imports* the base's constant (`review/codes.ts` already does; `triage/codes.ts` now does
 *     too), so a drift is unrepresentable rather than merely detectable. {@link SHARED_SEATS} records
 *     which meanings are claimed shared, so swapping an import back to a numeral reds instead of
 *     drifting quietly.
 *   - **The codes the group adds on its own account clear the base's whole table.** This one cannot
 *     be an import — the group's private codes are its own — so it is a check, and the check derives
 *     the base's occupied seats from the registry's exports. That is the direction that bit:
 *     `triage`'s `HUMAN_FILED` had to be re-seated `12` because `11` was already
 *     `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN` upstream, and it was a human reading both files side by side who caught
 *     it.
 *
 * Not every group aligns. `wire` allocates `3`-`6` for entirely different facts and is right to —
 * see {@link UNALIGNED_GROUPS}, which lists it rather than omitting it, because an omission is
 * indistinguishable from a group nobody registered.
 *
 * **What the guard scans is the shipped verb registry, not the tables on disk.** Scoping
 * the coverage check to directories that hold a `codes.ts` made the group with the loosest exit
 * discipline the one it could not see: `eval` shipped no table, so it was absent from the scan and
 * absent from both registries, and the check stayed green over it. A group is now checked because
 * `registry.ts` ships it, so the only way to leave one unchecked is to not ship it at all —
 * {@link coverageGaps} takes the registered names and reds on any it cannot classify.
