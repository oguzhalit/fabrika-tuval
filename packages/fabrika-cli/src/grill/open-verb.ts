/**
 * `grill open` topic/ticket path. The audit input and recovery path live in `audit-open.ts`.
 *
 * **Zero matching sessions is a fact, not a failed read**: no session existing is the ordinary
 * first-run state, and the verb mints one. A search that could not complete is
 * `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN` and mints nothing, because a caller that reads a failed search as "none"
 * opens a second session and splits the record.
 *
 * The label write is part of the create, never a caller's follow-up: the label is what makes the
 * session findable, so a created-but-unlabelled issue is the state this verb exists to prevent —
 * and when the label write is the half that fails, the refusal names the issue it orphaned.
 *
 * **Residual race, stated rather than closed.** Two runs interleaved between the same pair of
 * search-and-create calls still mint two sessions. `SESSION_AMBIGUOUS` catches that on the *next*
 * invocation rather than preventing it; a verb claiming to close it would be lying.
 *
 * **`--ticket` swaps the resume key, and that is the whole of it.** A session opened for a
 * wayfinding frontier ticket records the ticket in its body (`../wire/came-from.ts`) and later runs
 * match on *that*, so the same ticket resumes the same session however either title was edited
 * afterwards — the property a title match cannot hold, and without which a second run mints a
 * duplicate and splits the record the map is waiting on. The number is provenance only: the
 * ticket issue is read for its title and its existence, never for instruction.
 *
 * **A session whose binding does not parse stops the run.** The match walks open session bodies, and
 * a body reaching for `## Came from` and missing is neither a match nor a non-match — reading it as
 * "not this ticket" is how the resume silently mints the duplicate it exists to prevent. It seats on
 * {@link BINDING_MALFORMED} naming the session a human has to fix.
