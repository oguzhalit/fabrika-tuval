/**
 * What a grilling session is on GitHub, and how its comments are read back into questions and
 * markers — the one reader all five verbs share.
 *
 * A session is an issue carrying the `grilling:session` label. Its rounds and every recorded
 * ruling, answer and retirement live in its comments; nothing is kept locally, so there is no
 * scratch state for two runs to collide over.
 *
 * **A recorded ruling is bound to an authority, not to a string.** Every marker's author is
 * resolved against repository permissions before it counts, and a permission read that *fails* is
 * UNKNOWN rather than a demotion — the same invariant `../build/claim.ts` states. The
 * gate applies to all three markers, not only to rulings: `clear` requires every question to be
 * `answered`, `ruled` or `superseded`, and `clear` is the token a downstream skill keys on, so an
 * un-gated answer or retirement would let any account with push access walk a session into the
 * state that licenses the next step.
 *
 * **Zero comments is a fact; a comment read that could not complete is not.** The session that has
 * been opened and not yet grilled is the ordinary first state, and it reads `empty`. A read that
 * failed leaves every question's state UNKNOWN — never `open` — because an unpaginated or truncated
 * read would silently drop the newest rounds and report a ruled question as open, which is the
 * fail-open direction.
