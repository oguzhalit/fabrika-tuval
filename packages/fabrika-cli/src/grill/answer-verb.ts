/**
 * `grill answer` — record an agent-established answer to a `fact` question.
 *
 * **The kind guard is the mechanical half of the division of labour.** Recording an agent answer
 * against a `decision` question is work proceeding past a decision nobody made, so it is refused
 * rather than warned about. The finding is recorded as the agent's, never as authority: the comment
 * carries a `grill-answered:` marker and never a `grill-ruled:` one, and `recordedAs` is on the
 * answer object so a reader never infers authorship from the absence of a ruling marker.
 *
 * **The marker's digest is informational.** It records which text was answered, so a reader can see
 * the question moved, and it never changes the state — a re-worded `fact` stays `answered`. `stale`
 * exists to protect a *ruling* from drifting out from under the founder, and a fact has no founder
 * to protect.
 *
 * **Under-determined clause, surfaced rather than invented.** The contract's shared matrix
 * marks `DIGEST_UNBINDABLE` unreachable for this verb, while the `grill-answer` marker requires a
 * 12-hex digest field — so a round whose questions parse but whose blocks are missing a field the
 * digest is taken over leaves this verb with a marker it cannot compose and no seat allocated. It is
 * seated on `DIGEST_UNBINDABLE` here, which is the same fact under the same name the sibling verbs
 * use; folding it into `QUESTION_UNKNOWN` would put two meanings on one code.
