/**
 * `grill rule` — record a founder ruling. The only sanctioned path by which an agent records one.
 *
 * The four clauses are conjunctive and any miss resolves to *not recorded*, never to a warning: the
 * invoking token resolves `write+` at the ACL, the question exists, its round digests, and the
 * quoted authorization is present and dated. A bare stamp is void, which is why
 * `--authorization` is required rather than inferred. That last clause is `../authorization.ts`'s,
 * shared with `decision rule` so the two verbs cannot drift on what a quoted authority has to
 * survive.
 *
 * **Write ordering is an invariant, not an implementation detail.** The authorization comment lands
 * first and the marker second: an interrupted run that wrote the marker first would leave a void
 * ruling a careless reader sees as present, while the reverse leaves an authorization quote with no
 * marker, which resolves to nothing and harms no one.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: AUTHORIZATION-BINDS-ONE-QUESTION --> **An authorization binds the question it was
 * given about, and no other — and this is CONVENTION, not enforcement.** Say so plainly, because
 * the temptation is to claim otherwise. This verb digests the round holding the id it is *given*,
 * so stamping a three-day-old quote onto a brand-new, narrower question a later round split out
 * **succeeds**, and nothing here knows which question the quote was originally about. That sits
 * beside "the quoted authorization is truthful" as the second thing no machine can check; the
 * agent's restraint is what holds it. A quote answering an older, broader question is evidence for
 * a recommendation, never a ruling on the new one.
 *
 * **What `ruled` proves, exactly.** That a `write+` account posted a marker binding this question's
 * current text, with a dated authorization comment beside it. It does not prove the quoted
 * authorization is a truthful record of what the founder said, and nothing mechanical can: a
 * relayed ruling is indistinguishable from a fabricated one at the point it is recorded.
