/**
 * `grill round` — validate a round against the grammar, post it, and return its number, digest and
 * comment ids.
 *
 * The grammar is validated **before** the write, so a malformed round is a refusal with nothing
 * posted rather than a comment somebody has to delete. The round number is derived from the rounds
 * already on the session and never supplied by the caller, and the composed comment carries the
 * full `R<round>.<n>` ids so the caller learns its ids rather than guessing them.
 *
 * **Zero existing rounds is a fact — this is round 1.** A comment read that could not complete is
 * `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN` and posts nothing: the next round number would be a guess, and a guessed
 * round number collides with the round already there.
 *
 * **`--supersedes` is the retraction path, and it is what keeps a session finishable.** A question
 * whose text was re-worded goes `stale`, which is un-ruled, and holds the frontier open forever;
 * nothing else retires it. The retired question stays visibly on the record naming the round that
 * replaced it, which is retraction in the open rather than a wrong answer quietly overwritten.
 *
 * **The round is written first and the supersede marker second — the order is the conservative
 * half.** An interrupted run then leaves the replacement question posted and the old one still
 * holding the frontier: a question that should have been retired and was not is a nuisance, while a
 * question retired with no replacement posted is a silently dropped decision.
