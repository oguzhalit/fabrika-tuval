/**
 * `grill read` — the parser: per-question state, ACL-resolved, digest-checked, plus the frontier
 * token, every disregarded marker and the total audit-context read. Research never supplies rulings.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: READ-NEVER-REFUSES-ON-CONTENT --> **This verb never refuses on marker content.** A
 * malformed marker, an unauthorized author, or a digest binding no round are all **data** —
 * reported in `disregarded` at exit `0`, with the affected question left `open`. Refusing would
 * suppress the entire frontier answer over one bad comment, and would let any account with write
 * access disable the verb by posting one malformed marker. Its only refusals are a session that
 * does not exist and a read that could not complete.
 *
 * **Zero comments is a fact** — `empty`, the ordinary state of a session opened and not yet
 * grilled. A comment read that could not complete leaves every question's state UNKNOWN, never
 * `open`: an unpaginated read would silently drop the newest rounds and report a ruled question as
 * open, which is the fail-open direction.
 *
 * **Where a later marker meets an earlier one on the same question, the later comment wins.** The
 * markers are a log, and the newest record of a question is what the session currently says about
 * it; nothing edits or deletes an old one, so the log is also the audit trail.
