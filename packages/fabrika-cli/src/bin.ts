 * Two things happen here, in order. First the **delegation**: the copy on `PATH` finds the repo root
 * above the cwd and hands the invocation to the install that repo pins
 * ([`delegate/entry.ts`](./delegate/entry.ts) — the shape turbo ships). Then the router in
 * `run.ts`, loaded via a **dynamic** `import()` so an unlinked `catalog:` dep — the path hit on a
 * fresh checkout before `pnpm install` has settled — is a *catchable* `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` with a
 * legible remediation instead of a raw static-load throw.
