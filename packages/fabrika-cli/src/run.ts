/**
 * The fabrika router wiring — the real bin body, behind `bin.ts`'s bootstrap.
 *
 * It is loaded via a dynamic `import()` from `bin.ts` so an unlinked `catalog:` dep is a catchable
 * `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` the bin can explain, rather than a raw static-load throw.
 *
 * Wired per Effect-TS/effect's CLI guidance: `effect/unstable/cli` for the typed subcommands, the Node
 * platform over `NodeServices.layer`, run via `NodeRuntime.runMain`. The command itself lives in
 * `root-command.ts`; the subcommand set comes straight off `registry.ts`, so `--help` lists exactly
 * what is registered.
 *
 * The one thing that happens before the runner is the unknown-subcommand guard, which the runner
 * cannot do for itself — see `unknown-subcommand.ts` for why. The version string is resolved inside
 * the program, so only an invocation asking for it pays for the git read (`source-version.ts`).
