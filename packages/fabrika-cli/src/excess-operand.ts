/**
 * Refuse an operand a leaf verb never declared, instead of binding none of them and answering
 * anyway.
 *
 * At a leaf the Effect CLI parser reports nothing: `resolveFirstValue` gates its `UnknownSubcommand`
 * on `!expectsArgs && subIndex.size > 0`, and a leaf's `subIndex` is empty, so the token becomes a
 * positional; `parseParams` then binds the declared params in order and **returns**, dropping the
 * unconsumed remainder without an error (`effect@4.0.0-beta.92`,
 * `src/unstable/cli/internal/parser.ts` and `internal/command.ts`). Nothing is ever pushed into
 * `parsedArgs.errors`, so this is a *missing* check — not the ordering bug the sibling guard in
 * `unknown-subcommand.ts` works around, which loses an error that does get produced.
 *
 * The fix declares the remainder rather than re-deriving it. Every leaf gets one hidden trailing
 * catch-all argument, so the **parser** decides what is a flag value and what is a positional — the
 * one thing a pre-runner argv walk cannot do without reimplementing flag parsing — and hands the
 * leftovers to the handler, which refuses before the verb runs. A verb whose own arguments are
 * variadic absorbs its operands first and the catch-all stays empty, which is why `adr resolve` is
 * unaffected.
 *
 * The refusal is seated the way the interface convention requires
 * (`claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/cli-interface-convention.md` §2/§3): the reason on stderr, nothing
 * on stdout, exit `1`.
