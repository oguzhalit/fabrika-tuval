/**
 * The golden pointer as `ui golden` reads it: `{"store": "<base URL>", "surfaces": {"<id>":
 * {"sha256": "<hex>"}}}`, the bytes resolving as `GET <store>/<sha256>.png`.
 *
 * An unreadable pointer is **never** an empty blessed set. v1's probe resolved a failed read to zero
 * blessed surfaces with `|| true`, which reads to a caller as "nothing to compare against" — the
 * fail-open this parser and its `4`/`11` seats exist to refuse.
 *
 * Entry fields beyond `sha256` (a repo's own file may carry a blessing date or an intent note) are
 * carried by the repo, not by this contract, so they parse and are ignored rather than refused. A
 * pointer that names surfaces without a `store` is malformed: the bytes are unreachable,
 * and answering "blessed" for a golden nothing can fetch would be worse than refusing.
