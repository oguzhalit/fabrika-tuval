/**
 * The two preconditions the `ui` group shares: where the repo root is, and whether this lane is mine.
 *
 * **Lane mechanics are the `build` group's, reused — never respecified.** The parse, the claim
 * re-read and the nonce agreement all live in `../build/lane-guard.ts`; this module only re-seats
 * that guard's refusals onto the `ui` matrix, where every proven lane failure — foreign claim, no
 * claim, a branch that does not parse — is one code (`18`) and an unreadable claim state stays `11`.
 * Collapsing the three proven shapes onto one code is the contract's call: the caller's next act is
 * identical for all three, and the distinguishing detail rides on stderr.
 *
 * `ui manifest`, `ui law` and `ui golden` are pure reads and take no lane precondition — they call
 * {@link resolveRoot} and nothing here.
