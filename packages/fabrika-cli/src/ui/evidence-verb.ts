/**
 * `ui evidence` — upload the before/after captures, verify every upload, post one SHA-bound PR
 * comment, and read it back.
 *
 * **Evidence is all-or-nothing.** A comment showing three of five surfaces reads as "this is what
 * changed" and lies by omission, so a single failed upload or upload-verification is `17` with
 * nothing posted. That is the one behavior this verb most exists to pin: the upstream capture-side
 * upload channel is typed `never` and silently projects failures away (`../capture/upload.ts`), which
 * the *review* side tolerates because its verdict survives a missing image — here, on the
 * construction side, a failed upload is a refusal.
 *
 * The comment carries the PR's current head SHA in its text and a re-attach posts a **new** comment
 * at the new head: comments are append-only evidence, never edited in place, because evidence at a
 * stale head misleads.
