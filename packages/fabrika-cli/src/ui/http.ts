/**
 * The impure HTTP legs: fetching blessed golden bytes, and the two evidence upload tiers.
 *
 * Every one of them **verifies its own effect** rather than trusting a status line: the golden fetch
 * hands the bytes back for the caller to hash against the pointer, the store tier PUTs then GETs the
 * same content-addressed URL and hash-compares, and the attachment tier reads every returned URL
 * back through GitHub's renderer and compares the bytes (`../io/attachment-read-back.ts`). That is
 * the whole difference from the upstream capture-side upload, whose failures are projected away by
 * an error channel typed `never`: here a failed verification is a value the verb refuses on.
