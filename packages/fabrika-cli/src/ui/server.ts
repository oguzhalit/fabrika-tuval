/**
 * The impure harness leg: start every app a render needs, each on a freshly allocated free port,
 * wait for each to answer its own `readyPath`, and hand back the killer `ui render` runs on every
 * exit path.
 *
 * The commands are the repo's declaration (`uiSurfaces` in `.fabrika.jsonc`), never this package's knowledge of
 * any stack — that is what makes the group portable. Each process is started in its own group and
 * killed by group, because a dev server is habitually a wrapper that spawns the real listener: kill
 * the wrapper alone and the port stays held for the next lane.
 *
 * Ports are allocated here rather than declared, so two worktrees can render at once and neither can
 * reach the other's server. The allocation binds `:0`, reads the port the OS chose and lets
 * go, and the origin every capture is taken from is built from that number — so a declared command
 * **must** pass the port with its own strict-port flag. Losing the race then fails the start loudly;
 * a server that falls back to the next free port instead leaves the origin pointing at whatever else
 * answers there, and the readiness probe cannot tell that apart from its own server. An app whose
 * command cannot be made strict is left undeclared.
