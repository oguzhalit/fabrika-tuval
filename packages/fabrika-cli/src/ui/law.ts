/**
 * The typed prohibition registry's schema, validated **whole-file**.
 *
 * "Some rows parsed" is never an answer: a generator holding half the law believes it holds the law,
 * so one bad row refuses the file. Zero rows refuses too — a registry a repo committed asserts a
 * typed law, and an empty one is a drafting defect to surface rather than a fact to pass through
 * (the fail-closed-on-zero-scope shape, at document scale).
 *
 * The registry is normative and founder-ratified, behind a firewall: nothing in this package writes
 * it, because a checker that authors its own law checks nothing.
