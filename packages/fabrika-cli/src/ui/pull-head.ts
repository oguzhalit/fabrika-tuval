/**
 * The one PR field `ui evidence` needs that `../io/pulls.ts`'s record does not carry: the head
 * branch. An evidence comment on a PR whose head is some *other* lane's branch is a cross-lane
 * write, so the check needs the ref itself, not the head SHA the record already holds.
 *
 * The tracer for the fetch client: this read goes through `../io/gh-api.ts` rather than
 * `gh api`, so the client is proved by a running verb and not only by its own tests. A shape that is
 * not a branch name is a failure rather than an empty string — an unreadable ref must not compare
 * equal to a detached HEAD.
