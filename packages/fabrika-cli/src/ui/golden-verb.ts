/**
 * `ui golden` — resolve a surface's blessed golden and diff a candidate against it.
 *
 * **Signal, never verdict.** No threshold lives in this verb and no PASS/FAIL token is reachable from
 * it; the acceptance fork is `review-ui`'s. It reads the pointer and the bytes and writes neither:
 * blessing a golden stays a human gallery flow.
 *
 * A missing golden is a **fact** (`blessed: false`, exit 0) — but only after a pointer read that
 * succeeded. An unreadable pointer resolving to an empty blessed set is the fail-open that the
 * `4`/`11` seats exist to kill.
 *
 * The fetched bytes are cached content-addressed under the OS temp root, which makes the cache
 * lane-independent by construction: a content-addressed file is write-once, so concurrent lanes
 * cannot clobber each other and this verb needs no lane precondition to stay safe.
