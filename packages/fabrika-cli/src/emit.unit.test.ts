/**
 * The coverage guard: a group that writes its own `emit` opts out of the drain and truncates its
 * answers again, silently and on exit 0. Reds instead.
 *
 * It reads source text rather than behaviour on purpose — the defect is invisible in-process, so
 * only a spawn can observe it (`./emit.cli.test.ts` does, once), and spawning every group to prove
 * a shared helper is still shared is not a budget this package has.
