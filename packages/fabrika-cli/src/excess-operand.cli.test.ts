// @patch-pin: effect@4.0.0-rc.112
/**
 * The end-to-end half of the excess-operand guard: the **exit status** a caller actually reads.
 *
 * Also the registered behavior pin for the `effect` patch's hunk 3 (`buildHelpDoc` honouring
 * `Param.withHidden` on a positional): the help case below fails if upstream's unpatched
 * rendering comes back. It took the pin over when the package that used to carry it was removed.
 *
 * The defect this covers produced a successful-looking result — exit 0 with the id `adr next` would
 * have printed anyway — so a test asserting on stdout *content* is exactly the test that passes
 * against the bug. Every case below asserts the exit code and stderr instead.
 *
 * **Four spawns, and none of them touch the network.** Each `it` costs one cold node+TS load of
 * `bin.ts` — about 2.3s on a CI runner — so spawn count *is* this file's cost, and the matrix it
 * used to walk twelve times is covered in 19ms by `excess-operand.unit.test.ts`. What only a
 * subprocess can prove is the exit status, which needs a handful of representative invocations, not
 * one per phrasing. Twelve spawns plus one that fetched `origin/main` for real is what timed out and
 * ejected the pull request from the merge queue; the cwd that removes that fetch is explained at its
 * case.
