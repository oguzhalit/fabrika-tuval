/**
 * Decide, and then act on, which copy of `fabrika` serves this invocation.
 *
 * The decision is a pure function of four facts — where the running copy lives, *which checkout it
 * belongs to*, whether the cwd has a repo root, and what that root's install probe said — so every
 * branch is testable without a filesystem.
 *
 * **No branch is both silent and wrong.** No repo root at all runs the global with no warning,
 * deliberately, so global-only invocations still work. A repo root whose local install is missing or
 * corrupt runs the global too, but *says so loudly* — that pairing is the whole design: tiers that
 * can only be right or loudly absent are fine; tiers that can be quietly wrong are the defect.
 * One tier used to be quietly wrong against that rule and is now a refusal: a copy invoked out of a
 * *different repository* is not a global install, and delegating it answered from a tree the caller
 * never named. What counts as different is [`repository.ts`](./repository.ts)'s to decide — a
 * working tree of the same repository is not.
