/**
 * The end-to-end half of the worktree-peer delegation: a real process, invoked exactly the
 * way the defect is met.
 *
 * The copy on `PATH` is a `pnpm link --global` of the primary checkout, so an agent standing in a
 * worktree who types the bare `fabrika` invokes the *primary's* `bin.ts` with a cwd in another
 * working tree of the same repository. Only a spawn proves the copy on disk hands the invocation
 * over, because the delegation's whole failure mode is that both copies print the same bytes.
 *
 * The fixture points a scratch checkout's git plumbing at THIS checkout's real common dir, which is
 * what `git worktree add` does and what makes the two trees one repository. Its counterpart is
 * [`foreign-checkout.cli.test.ts`](./foreign-checkout.cli.test.ts), whose scratch tree shares no
 * repository and must still be refused.
