/**
 * Whether the repo root holds an installed copy of this package, and where.
 *
 * Resolution is **Node's own**, from the root manifest: `createRequire(<root>/package.json)
 * .resolve('@kampus/fabrika-cli/package.json')`. That single call already covers pnpm's symlinked
 * `.pnpm` layout, hoisting to a non-ancestor and unusual nesting — all of which a hand-built
 * `node_modules/@kampus/fabrika-cli` path join gets wrong. turbo needs four search strategies only
 * because it ships prebuilt native binaries per platform; a pure-TS CLI has exactly one package, so
 * there is **no** platform-package resolution here (turbo `main` @ `c6fbc97`,
 * `crates/turborepo-shim/local_turbo_state.rs`).
 *
 * Node's own resolution is not *only* the `node_modules` walk, though: it falls back to `NODE_PATH`,
 * which the pnpm-generated global `fabrika` shim exports as an absolute chain rooted at the checkout
 * it was installed from. So the walk fails in a repo with no install and the fallback answers
 * anyway — with the global's own copy, which `resolve` then reads as "the repo-local install is this
 * copy". {@link isInsideRepo} is the containment rule that closes it: an install the probe
 * cannot place under `repoRoot` is not that repo's install, whatever Node found.
 *
 * The probe is total over three outcomes and **none of them is a throw**: found, absent, or corrupt.
 * Corrupt is deliberately not fatal — turbo's own note at the equivalent branch is *"we can choose
 * to operate this aggressively because the _worst_ outcome is that we run global turbo"* — but it is
 * never silent either: the caller warns loudly and names the reason.
