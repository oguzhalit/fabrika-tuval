 * The invocation a spawned shell should run this CLI's verbs through — the value `lane brief` puts

 *
 * The rules used to name this package's own `packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts` as a literal, which
 * is a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` in every repo that installs fabrika rather than developing it. What
 * replaces it is not one shape but a rule over two, and the discriminator is the one
 * `delegate/root.ts` already owns — is the running copy a checkout of this package's own repo, or an
 * installed artifact?
 *
 * - **A checkout** answers repo-relative, because the shell stands in its own worktree of that same
 *   repo and must run *its* copy of the source. An absolute path would send it to the driver's
 *   checkout, which is the cross-checkout invocation the binstub ban exists for, arriving by
 *   another door.
 * - **An installed artifact** answers absolute, because a worktree cut from a repo carries no
 *   `node_modules` of its own and a repo-relative `node_modules/…` path would not exist there.
