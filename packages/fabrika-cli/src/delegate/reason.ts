/**
 * The one grammatical shape every delegation "why the local install is unusable" clause must take.
 *
 * The loud branch's first line splices the repo root and the clause into one sentence
 * (`— ${repoRoot} ${reason}.`), so a clause carrying its own subject renders as two sentences
 * jammed together: `— /repo it has no local install.` The rule that fixes it is that the
 * clause is a **predicate whose subject is the repo root**, never a standalone sentence.
 *
 * Grammar is not machine-checkable, so the brand does not verify the rule — it makes the rule
 * unavoidable. A producer cannot hand a bare `string` to {@link globalWarning}; it has to reach for
 * this constructor, and the rule is stated where it reaches.

 *
 * A trailing full stop is dropped because the caller supplies the one that ends the sentence, and an
 * interpolated foreign string can bring its own — `String(error)` on a Node resolution failure ends
 * in a period, which rendered as `…package.json..`.
