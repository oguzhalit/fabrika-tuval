/**
 * The four preconditions every `ledger` verb runs before it answers, in one place so ten copies cannot
 * drift apart: resolve the repo, refuse a target that is not a `type:epic`, read the tree root the run
 * directory hangs off, and prove this session holds the epic's claim.
 *
 * The claim is the **`build` group's, reused as landed verbs** — no second lock is derived. v1's
 * `epic-lock` is why: all five of its distinct outcomes collapsed onto exit `1`, it wrote the
 * `status:planning` label *before* the claim comment so a failed claim left a held label with no owner,
 * and its release re-found "our own" claim by session id, so a sibling lane's release retracted the
 * holder's claim.
 *
 * The run directory is derived from the **claim nonce** here and nowhere else, which is what makes two
 * parallel planning lanes of one session independent. That independence is why the claim is proven
 * against the `--token` this lane holds rather than against its session id: under the session-only
 * rule a lane that had *lost* the epic's claim still read the holder's marker as its own, and derived
 * the holder's run key from it, so both lanes wrote into one directory.
