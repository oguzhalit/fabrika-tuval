/**
 * The one exit table the eleven `ledger` verbs allocate from.
 *
 * Three tiers, and the tier decides how a constant gets here rather than what it means:
 *
 * - `3`–`11` are `report`'s seats, reached through `build`'s re-exports so there is one hop, not two
 *   tables to keep level. `ALIGNED_GROUPS` records the claim under `BUILD_SEATS` — *not*
 *   `SHARED_SEATS`, which omits `BAD_SECTIONS`: four verbs here seat `4`, so under `SHARED_SEATS`
 *   the checker would report `4` as a private code colliding with the base.
 * - `13`–`19` are `build`'s, **re-exported verbatim**, because this group asserts the identical fact
 *   (this session holds this issue's claim) and a caller driving both in one sweep must read one
 *   meaning for each. `12` is not among them: it is `build`'s retired seat. The re-export stops at `19`:
 *   `13`, `14`, `16`, `17`, `18` and `19` are **never reached here** — this skill declares no
 *   `--require-clean` flag, holds no lane branch, pushes nothing, runs no validation and derives no
 *   readiness verdict — but carrying them keeps those seats occupied so a later verb here cannot
 *   re-seat one.
 * - `20`–`26` are this group's own. `build`'s `21` is deliberately **not** re-exported (its `20` is
 *   a retired seat): re-exporting `AUDIENCE_NOT_AGENT` alongside these would put two names on one
 *   code in one module, which `allocatedCodes` reports as drift. The rule this group follows, taken from
 *   `plan/codes.ts` rather than re-derived: **import a code when two groups prove the same fact;
 *   allocate freely when they do not.** No `build`, `epic` or `plan` verb can prove a fact about a
 *   *plan being authored*, and an exit code is read off the command that produced it.
 *
 * `0`, `1`, `2` and `127` are reserved by the interface convention (`../verb.ts`, `../bin.ts`).
