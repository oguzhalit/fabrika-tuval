/**
 * `ledger retopology` — rewrite one epic's `## Dependencies` block from its live child links.
 *
 * The repair a founder descope owes. Unlinking a child on the board leaves the epic body's topology
 * naming it, and `lane emit` refuses at `16` for as long as that line stands. Nothing repaired it:
 * the verbs that own the block are the planning group, and every one of them requires a staged plan
 * run, so fixing one line meant re-running a whole authoring pass. `ledger supersede` is the wrong
 * shape too — it closes the child `not_planned` and unlinks it, while a descoped child keeps living
 * on its own lane.
 *
 * So this verb is deliberately the smallest thing that ends the wedge: it holds the epic's claim
 * through {@link openGround} like every sibling, and reads **no** run directory — no `run.json`, no
 * manifest, no staged document — because a cleared run is exactly the state a descoped epic is
 * found in. Its `--body-digest` comes from `ledger digest` for the same reason: `ledger open` prints
 * the same value only by allocating the run this verb needs none of. It closes, unlinks and comments
 * on nothing; retiring a child stays `ledger supersede`'s job.
 *
 * It renders through `renderDependencies` and re-parses through the shipped reader before writing
 * (`checkTopology`'s round trip), so a block the emitter would read differently from how it was
 * rendered is refused with nothing written — and being a rewrite of what is already there, running
 * it twice issues one PATCH: the second run composes the body it is standing in and answers
 * `unchanged`.
