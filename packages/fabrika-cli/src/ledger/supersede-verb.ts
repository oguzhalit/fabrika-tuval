/**
 * `ledger supersede` — retire a child the re-plan no longer contains.
 *
 * Three legs in a fixed order — **comment, unlink, close** — then a re-read proving the child is
 * `closed` with `state_reason` `not_planned` and no longer a sub-issue. The order is load-bearing:
 * closing before unlinking leaves a closed issue still counted as a sub-issue, which the gate reads as
 * a child in scope that can never carry a live assignee. What to do about that residue on children
 * that already carry it is undecided; this verb simply does not create more of it. The journal
 * comment goes first so the reason survives even if a later leg fails.
 *
 * The two refusals are the guard v1's equivalent had none of: it "closed exactly the numbers you name"
 * with no check at all. A child that is not this epic's is refused, and so is one **this run minted** —
 * a child the current plan just created is not one the current plan supersedes, and letting that
 * through is how a re-plan deletes its own work. A *retained* child is exactly what this verb is for,
 * so the refusal narrows to the minted set rather than the whole manifest.
