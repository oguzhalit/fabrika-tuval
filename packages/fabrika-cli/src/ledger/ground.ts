/**
 * The freshness proof: how far this tree's HEAD sits behind the trunk (`../io/trunk.ts`).
 *
 * **The tree is stale by default until shown otherwise.** v1 planned against stale checkouts and
 * minted phantom children, and nothing syncs the tree after a merge at any call site — so there is
 * no third arm here. A probe that *fails* is a failed read (`11`), never `20`: "I could not
 * tell" is not "it is stale", and it is certainly not "it is fresh".
 *
 * The base is fetched before it is read, through the shipped `fetchAndResolve` — reading a stale local
 * ref is the whole defect class.
