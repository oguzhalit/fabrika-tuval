/**
 * `ledger draft` — validate and stage the model-authored plan block.
 *
 * A total grammar check over a closed section set, and nothing more. Whether the plan is any *good* is
 * irreducibly the skill's: a `### Approach` reading "TBD" stages cleanly. What this verb refuses is
 * the class an author cannot see — v1's section set lived only in prose, so drift produced a `Corrupt`
 * splice refusal much later with no statement of which section was wrong.
 *
 * The digest is compared against the `--body-digest` **flag** and nothing else. Falling back to the
 * value recorded on `run.json` would compare the plan against itself and make the moved-epic check
 * vacuous.
