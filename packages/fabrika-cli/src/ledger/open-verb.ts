/**
 * `ledger open` — prove the ground fresh, allocate the run, read what already exists, rank duplicate
 * candidates.
 *
 * The run directory is created **here and nowhere else**; every later verb re-derives it from the
 * claim nonce and refuses if it is gone. Three facts are decided once, here, and read off `run.json`
 * afterwards rather than carried in anyone's head: the run's `mode`, the `cycleDoc` reading, and the
 * body digest the two guarded verbs are held to.
 *
 * **A re-open is a resume, not a reset.** `runKey` comes from the claim nonce, which a re-open does not
 * change, so this verb finds the previous attempt's files. It re-seeds `children.jsonl` from the live
 * sub-issue list and **leaves `plan.md` and `topology.md` untouched** — re-staging either is `ledger
 * draft`'s and `ledger topology`'s job, and silently discarding a staged document a caller has not
 * replaced would lose authored work with no refusal to notice.
