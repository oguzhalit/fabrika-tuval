/**
 * Where the plan goes in the epic body, resolved by anchors rather than by position.
 *
 * **Detection is the verb-written enrichment marker, never a position**: with the
 * marker doing the detecting, appending the plan below the preserved brief envelope breaks no
 * detector, so no layout inversion is needed. What the marker buys here is the *bound*: a
 * `## Dependencies` heading that resolves **inside** the preserved brief is not this run's anchor, and
 * cutting there is how v1 destroyed a body.
 *
 * **The region is never cut to end-of-file.** v1's replace branch sliced from the `## Dependencies`
 * heading to EOF on the assumption that dependencies are the last section, destroying anything a human
 * had appended below with no guard at all. This module resolves a bounded region and preserves every
 * byte outside it.
