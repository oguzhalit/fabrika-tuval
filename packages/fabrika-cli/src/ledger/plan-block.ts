/**
 * The plan block's grammar: the closed section set and the story list, checked before anything is
 * staged.
 *
 * The check is total over *shape* and says nothing about content — a `### Approach` reading "TBD"
 * stages cleanly, and catching that is the skill's job, not a verb's. What it does catch is the class
 * an author cannot see: `readEpicStories` collects ids only from ordered-list rows, so a
 * `### User stories` section full of `-` bullets or `S1`-style labels parses as **zero stories** while
 * looking complete. The gate's floor then reds `MISSING_STORIES_SECTION` over the whole epic — a
 * planner writing a plan its own gate rejects, which is the failure this group exists to prevent.
 *
 * The section presence and duplication counts come from the gate's own `sectionCount`, so the composer
 * is held to the reader it is composing for. Only the *ordering* is derived here, because no shipped
 * reader answers it.
 *
 * `### Acceptance criteria` is checked the same way and for the same reason: it is the contract the
 * epic *tail* PR is graded against, so a section of prose under that heading reads back `Absent`
 * through the shared wire format and leaves `review criteria` with nothing — the story-list failure
 * pointing at a different section.
