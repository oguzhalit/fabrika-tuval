/**
 * `ledger child` — mint one child with every birth attribute in one create, link it, re-read it,
 * record it.
 *
 * **The manifest append sits before the link, deliberately.** A child recorded before its link is a
 * child a successor can find and name, which is the whole of what the record buys — and it is enough,
 * because the alternative is an issue that exists on GitHub and appears in no artifact this run
 * produced. Under the reverse order a `23` leaves an issue that is absent from the manifest and can
 * therefore be neither placed (`24`, dangling) nor retired (`10`, not a sub-issue) — created,
 * unusable, and unreachable by every other verb in the group.
 *
 * **A home is required too**: a child born with neither an open milestone nor a standing lane groups
 * under no campaign and no lane, so nothing on the board shows where it belongs. The refusal is here
 * at birth, where the remedy is one flag.
 *
 * `--ready-for` is required and has no default; `--ready-for human` requires `--assignee` — the label
 * is the routing signal, born-assignment is the enforced hold, and neither substitutes for the other. That pair is not merely a convention: the gate's floor reds
 * `HELD_CHILD_UNASSIGNED` over the **whole epic**, so one held-and-unassigned child blocks every
 * sibling.
 *
 * **A `type:decision` child is never born `ready-for:agent`.** A build claim admits a decision only
 * against a ruling comment recorded on that same decision issue, and a child a second old carries
 * none — so the pair publishes a child every builder refuses on its type axis, which parks the epic
 * lane. The refusal sits with the other pre-write input checks; the supported route is
 * `ready-for:human` with an assignee, then `fabrika decision rule <n> --cites <child-comment-url>`
 * once the ruling is recorded on the child.
