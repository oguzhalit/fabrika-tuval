/**
 * The GitHub surface this group needs that no shipped module already makes.
 *
 * Two of these are genuinely new to fabrika, and they are the reason this file exists: **nothing
 * shipped writes a sub-issue link.** `plan/github.ts`'s `listSubIssues` is the read half — imported
 * and used as-is where numbers are enough — and the write half (`POST .../sub_issues`,
 * `DELETE .../sub_issue`) is derived here. Both take the child's **database `id`, not its number**,
 * which is the one shape v1 got right and is worth not rediscovering.
 *
 * The two readers below carry fields the shipped readers drop, which is the same justification
 * `plan/github.ts` gives for `getChild` over `getIssue`: {@link listSubIssueEntries} carries the `id`
 * the link and unlink take, and {@link readChildBack} carries labels, assignees **and** milestone
 * together, which no shipped shape does — and a read-back that cannot see all three cannot prove the
 * one create call landed every birth attribute.
 *
 * The package's two standing disciplines hold throughout, unchanged by the move off `gh`:
 * every list read pages in full and hands back the proof it did, and a shape that is not what was
 * asked for is a failure, never an empty result. Every write here still proves itself by a read-back
 * or by the caller's own re-read — a write's own response echo is not evidence anywhere it was not
 * evidence before.
