/**
 * `ledger adopt` — bring an already-filed issue into the plan as a child, instead of minting a
 * near-duplicate of it.
 *
 * Every judgment runs before the first write, so a refusal writes nothing. The writes then run in
 * the order a re-run can finish: the amendment first (an unlinked, unrecorded issue is still just
 * the report it was), the park on `status:planned` second, the manifest record third, the link
 * last — so the issue is never a linked child while it is still pickable. **Each leg is idempotent
 * against the live state rather than against a memory of the last attempt** — the amendment is
 * composed only from field lines the body does not already declare, the park is skipped when the
 * issue no longer carries `status:triaged`, the manifest line is replaced rather than appended, and
 * the link is skipped when the parent endpoint already names this epic — so a refusal after any leg
 * is recovered by running the same command again.
 *
 * The park is its only label write. It writes no milestone, assignee or title, and no other label.
 *
