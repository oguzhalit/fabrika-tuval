/**
 * `ledger digest` — print one epic's body digest, staging nothing.
 *
 * The digest the guarded verbs require had exactly one source: `ledger open`, which allocates the
 * run directory, seeds `children.jsonl` and refuses `20` on a tree behind the trunk. For
 * `draft` and `write` that is right — they run inside the run `open` allocated. For `ledger
 * retopology` it was a contradiction: that verb's whole claim is that it needs no staged plan run,
 * and the only way to obtain its required `--body-digest` was to stage one. An operator who hit
 * `lane emit`'s `16` mid-drive read a sanctioned route it could not execute.
 *
 * So this verb is the digest and nothing else: `openGround`'s four preconditions, one body read,
 * one value on stdout. It creates no directory, writes no file, and touches no issue — a re-read of
 * the same epic a second later is the same call.
 *
 * It is deliberately not a fifth way to compute the digest: it calls the same {@link bodyDigest}
 * `open`, `draft`, `write` and `retopology` call, so a value printed here and a value recomputed
 * there can only differ because the body moved, which is what `21` is for.
