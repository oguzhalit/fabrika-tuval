/**
 * The `ledger` verb group — `fabrika ledger <verb>`.
 *
 * The adapter and nothing else: it declares the flags (`--help` is the interface, so every flag carries
 * a one-line description), runs the pure verb, and emits its outcome. Every decision lives in the
 * `*-verb.ts` modules beside it, which is what makes each refusal testable without spawning a process.
 *
 * **Every leaf is declared with `leafCommand`, never a bare `Command.make`** — the bare form silently
 * opts out of the excess-operand guard, which `../excess-operand.unit.test.ts` reds on.
 *
 * Eight leaves author a plan run. `retopology`, `digest` and `defer` are the three that read no run
 * directory at all — each belongs to the descope route, which is found on epics whose run was long
 * since cleared: `retopology` repairs the block, `digest` prints the input that repair takes, and
 * `defer` unlinks the child. Sourcing any of them from `ledger open` would put the staged run back
 * in a route built not to need one.
 *
 * **`--ready-for` is optional at the parser and refused in the verb body.** A parser-required flag's
 * absence is exit `1`, indistinguishable from a typo; an absent audience is a decision nobody made,
 * which must be provable as `10`. `--body-digest`, `--child` and `--title` stay
 * parser-required, because their absence is an ordinary usage error with no semantic content and their
 * fail-open risk is a *wrong* value — which is `21` and `10` respectively, not a missing one.
