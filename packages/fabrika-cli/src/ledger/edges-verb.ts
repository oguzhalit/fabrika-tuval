/**
 * `ledger edges` — write the epic's `## Dependencies` block into GitHub's native `blocked_by` graph.
 *
 * That graph is the one carrier of blockedness, and both build gates read only it. A plan whose
 * dependencies live in prose alone therefore admits a child it has already declared blocked — an epic
 * planned that way let a child gated behind an open, unruled decision through `build claim` on
 * `scanned 0 blocked_by edges`. This verb closes that gap by writing the edges the block owes.
 *
 * **It reads the epic's own body, never this run's staged topology**, so it reconciles an epic planned
 * by an earlier run exactly as it reconciles one written a moment ago. The board is what the gates
 * read, so the board is what this compares against.
 *
 * **Reconcile, never replace.** Only missing edges are POSTed; an edge already there is `already` and
 * an edge nobody's plan names is left alone. A `blocked_by` list may carry edges no ledger authored —
 * a human's, another epic's — and deleting one because this block does not name it would silently
 * unblock work on the strength of a document that was never the carrier.
 *
 * **The confirming re-read only runs when something was POSTed.** On the idempotent path the first
 * read already proved every required edge present, so re-reading can only convert a transient GitHub
 * blip into `WRITE_UNKNOWN` over zero writes — a code whose whole meaning is "edges were POSTed and
 * cannot be confirmed".
