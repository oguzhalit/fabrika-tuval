/**
 * `ledger write` — splice the staged plan and topology into the epic body, byte-verified.
 *
 * **`mode` is never re-derived here.** It was decided once by `ledger open`, and a `write` that
 * recomputed it from the live body could disagree with the `open` that named the run — which is
 * precisely how the mode-mismatch arm becomes unreachable and a first-time append silently overwrites
 * a real plan.
 *
 * The comparison after the PATCH is over the **whole** normalized body, not a re-extraction of the
 * region: v1 truncated an epic body to end-of-file whenever a `## Dependencies` heading appeared inside
 * the preserved brief, and its round-trip check could not see it because both sides ran the same
 * first-occurrence extractor. This verb attempts once; `ledger write --help` describes its results.
