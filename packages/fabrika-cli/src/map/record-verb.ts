/**
 * `map record` — the lockstep: the answer lands under `## Decisions`, the ticket's row leaves
 * `## Frontier`, and the sub-issue closes.
 *
 * The two body edits are one PATCH and the close is second, ordered so the surviving half of a
 * partial application is the visible-and-re-runnable one — an answer recorded against a still-open
 * ticket — rather than the forbidden one, a closed ticket with no recorded answer. Re-runnable is
 * enforced, not asserted: a ticket whose answer the body already carries takes the resume branch and
 * only closes, so finishing an interrupted lockstep is the verb again — re-read the map, re-run
 * against its new digest — never a hand-close.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: RELAY-GRILLINGS-STATE-NEVER-RECOMPUTE-IT --> **A cited ruling is read by importing
 * the `grill` group's reader, never by re-deriving it here.** A ruling counts only when four clauses
 * hold, and those clauses are `grill read`'s to resolve; a second implementation here would be a
 * second answer to a question already enforced elsewhere, and the one that said `ruled` would win by
 * being called. So every entry carrying a `Ruled` authority — forked ticket or not — is proven by
 * `grill read` through `requireRuling` and records only what that reader calls `ruled`: a read that
 * did not complete is `11` and any other state is `13` naming it, because UNKNOWN is never resolved
 * to `ruled`.
