/**
 * `map ticket` — file a frontier ticket, link it as a sub-issue, set its blocking edges, and splice
 * its line onto the map, as one act.
 *
 * **Preconditions resolve before anything is written.** Every `--blocks` and `--blocked-by` target is
 * existence-checked, confirmed to be a ticket of this map, and resolved to its internal id, and the
 * cycle check runs — all before the create. That ordering is what makes `13`, `14`, `18` and `19`
 * honestly mean *nothing was written*: an id that cannot be resolved is discovered while the frontier
 * is still untouched, rather than after a ticket exists.
 *
 * **Write order, and what each partial application leaves.** Create the ticket, post its marker
 * comment, link it as a sub-issue, set the edges, then splice the map body — in that order, with the
 * body guard re-checked immediately before the splice. A failure after the create leaves an issue
 * with no marker, which `map read` does not count as a ticket of this map, so it is inert rather than
 * half-present and a re-run resumes it. The splice is last because it is the only write that can be
 * lost to a concurrent writer, so it spends the shortest possible time between the guard and the
 * write.
