/**
 * The composite read every `map` verb rests on: the map issue, its parsed body, its children, and
 * each child's resolved frontier state.
 *
 * State is resolved from the ticket's markers, its own `state` on GitHub, and its native edges — the
 * body's `## Frontier` rows are a rendering of this answer, never the record of it. An implementer
 * who derives state by matching headings has rebuilt the v1 scar this module exists to remove.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: NEVER-PASS-ON-A-FAILED-READ --> **An empty read that cannot be proven empty is
 * UNKNOWN.** v1's dangling-reference check disabled itself whenever the sub-issue read came back
 * empty (`if (subIssues.length > 0)`), so a rate-limited call silently removed the check rather than
 * refusing, which is a pass over a scope nothing read. Here zero children is a **fact** only when the
 * platform proved it with `200 []`; every other outcome is {@link FrontierRead.Unknown}.
