/**
 * `map open` — mint or resume the map for a destination, refusing a destination that is not fog.
 *
 * The check order is local-first: everything decidable from the bytes on stdin runs before any
 * network read, so a refusable input costs no API call and a refusal always names the cheapest
 * correctable thing first.
 *
 * **Zero open maps is a fact, not a failed read** — the first map in a repository is the ordinary
 * case. A search that could not complete is `11`, and nothing is written.
 *
 * **Write order, and what a partial application leaves.** The issue is created first, the label
 * second. A failure between them leaves a map issue nobody can find, which is `8` with the number
 * named on stderr so a human can finish it — the surviving half is inert rather than harmful. The
 * reverse order is not available (a label cannot be applied to an issue that does not exist), which
 * is why the orphan is named rather than prevented.
