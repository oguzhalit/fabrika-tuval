 * failure between them produced exactly the state its own shape doc forbids — *the map is never left
 * in a state where a resolved unknown has no recorded answer*. Folding the two body edits into one
 * PATCH makes that state unrepresentable, which is why {@link applyRecord} returns one string rather
