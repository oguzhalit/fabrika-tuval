/**
 * `map finding` — close a lane with an outcome from a closed set.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: NOTHING-IS-NOT-EMPTY --> **The outcome vocabulary keeps three answers apart that an
 * absence would collapse into one.** `answered` means the lane established the fact and the finding
 * carries it. `no-evidence` means the lane looked and the evidence is not there — a **result**, and
 * the finding, when given, records where it looked. `unreachable` means the lane could not look at
 * all. A verb that accepted a silent empty finding would let all three arrive as one, which is
 * exactly how a zero-files-read classifier ships a plausible answer. There is no fourth value and
 * no default.
 *
 * This verb writes on the **ticket** and never touches the map body — that is `map record`,
 * deliberately separate, so the lane traffic of a parallel burndown never contends on the one body
 * every lane shares.
