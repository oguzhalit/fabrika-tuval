/**
 * The map body: its five sections, the entries each holds, the compare-and-set digest over them, and
 * the slice writes that change one section without touching the rest.
 *
 * Two properties this module exists to hold, both scars from v1's map:
 *
 * - **A line's section is not its state.** v1 encoded a ticket's state as which heading its bullet
 *   sat under, in a body no shipped tool wrote, then read it back "tolerantly" to cope with its own
 *   drift. Here the rows are a *rendering*: `../map/frontier.ts` resolves state from markers, issue
 *   state and edges, and this module only composes and parses the bytes.
 * - **A write is a slice, never a reconstruction.** {@link spliceSection} replaces the bytes of one
 *   section and copies the rest verbatim, so a concurrent edit to another section survives even when
 *   the digest guard admits the write.
 *
 * An **empty section is well-formed** and never refuses. A map at mint has an empty `## Decisions`,
 * `## Frontier` and `## Out of scope`; a parser that refused one would make every freshly minted map
 * unreadable by the next verb that touched it.
