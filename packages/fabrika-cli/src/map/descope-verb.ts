/**
 * `map descope` — append a rejected direction and its reasoning to the never-graduating out-of-scope
 * section, optionally retiring the frontier ticket that asked it.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: OUT-OF-SCOPE-NEVER-GRADUATES --> **This section is append-only and has no removal
 * path, by construction: no verb in this group deletes from it.** Every other section empties as fog
 * clears; this one is the map's memory of what was decided *against*, and an entry that can be
 * removed is one the next session re-proposes. Reversing a rejection is a new decision under
 * `## Decisions` naming the entry it overturns — both stay on the record.
 *
 * **The fence is checked, not assumed.** The composed section is validated with `appendOnly` and a
 * re-parse that must hold every prior entry plus exactly one more; a write that would drop or mutate
 * an existing entry refuses, because the read-back proves the body no longer holds what it held.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: EVERY-TICKET-HAS-AN-EXIT --> `--ticket` is the second exit off the frontier, and it is
 * what keeps `clear` reachable: a question whose lane returned `unreachable` has no answer to record,
 * so without a retiring path it would hold the frontier forever and `graduate` could never run.
