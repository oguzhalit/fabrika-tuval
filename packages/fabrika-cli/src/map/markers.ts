/**
 * The five one-line markers this group writes on a frontier ticket, and their readers.
 *
 * Ticket state lives in markers, issue state and native edges — never in a body row (see
 * `./body.ts`). Each marker is composed here and nowhere else, so the grammar has one home and a
 * reader cannot drift from a writer.
 *
 * **These are the group's own grammar, not `../build/claim.ts`'s.** That module's `composeMarker`
 * hardcodes the `build-claim:` prefix, its `MARKER_RE` matches only that, and its `resolveOwnership`
 * compares a **session** token. This group's lanes are keyed on a **run nonce**, so calling it would
 * find zero markers on a frontier ticket and answer *unclaimed* on every call — a lane that can never
 * see a sibling lane's claim, which is precisely the collision the nonce exists to prevent.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: LANE-KEY-IS-THE-RUN-NONCE --> The lane key is the caller's run nonce, never a session
 * id and never a pid: the session id is pane-constant rather than per-run, and sibling subagents of
 * one parent share it, so two lanes of one charting run would key onto one namespace and each would
 * classify the other's claim as its own. Nothing here reads the environment — the nonce arrives as
 * an argument.
