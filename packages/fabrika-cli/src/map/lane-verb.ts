/**
 * `map lane` — claim a research lane on one ticket, keyed on the run nonce, refusing a `decision`
 * ticket.
 *
 * A compare-and-set on a marker under a closed-set kind guard. Re-running with the nonce that already
 * holds the lane is `resumed`, not an error: a stateless re-dispatch of the same run must be able to
 * prove it still owns the lane without a second claim.
