/**
 * Main-alarm bin — the CI-callable IO shell over `./main-alarm.ts`'s pure {@link decide}: read the
 * run's facts off the environment and its result off `--result`, resolve the repo's alarm settings,
 * list the candidate alarm issues, perform the one write the core named, and print what it did.
 *
 * **Not routed through `fabrika`'s bin, and that is the point.** This is the notification path for a
 * build that just broke, so it must not depend on the install that may be what broke. Its job runs
 * checkout + setup-node + this file, with no `pnpm install`; every import on the runtime graph is a
 * relative plain-TS module the runtime type-strips, and an `effect` import anywhere on it would put
 * the CLI's dependency tree between a red main and the ping about it. The config half is read
 * through `config/document.ts` over `io/json.ts` for exactly that reason — the Effect file opener
 * would put `effect` back on this graph. The same constraint is why `required-bin.ts` is a bare bin.
 *
 * Every GitHub call is plain `fetch` against the REST API with the workflow's own `GITHUB_TOKEN` —
 * no client library, no new secret, nothing to install.
 *
 * Exits 0 when the decided write landed (or there was none to make) and 1 when it did not, so the
 * job goes red if the report itself failed to file. That redness is on the alarm job, never on the
 * work it reports: that work has already concluded by the time this runs.
