/**
 * `ci annotate` — a pass-through filter that re-emits each tsc diagnostic as a GitHub `::error`
 * workflow command, so a failing CI typecheck lands inline on the PR diff.
 *
 *   pnpm typecheck | node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts ci annotate
 *
 * **The one verb in this package that writes streams itself instead of returning a `VerbOutcome`.**
 * The outcome shape buffers stdout to the end, and the whole point here is that the CI log stays
 * live while the typecheck runs — withholding it until EOF would make a long typecheck look hung.
 *
 * The producer owns the gate result through `pipefail`; this reporter must not fail the step
 * it reports on or swallow an input line.
