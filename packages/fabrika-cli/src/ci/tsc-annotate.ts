/**
 * `ci annotate` pure core — turn tsc/tsgo diagnostics into GitHub `::error` workflow
 * commands so a failing CI typecheck renders inline on the PR diff. The verb exists
 * because tsc ships no annotations reporter. IO-free and total: every decision is a
 * deterministic transform over already-captured text.
 *
 * Three non-obvious facts the parser is built around, all observed from a real
 * `pnpm turbo run typecheck` failure rather than assumed:
 *
 *   1. A diagnostic's path is relative to the PACKAGE directory (turbo runs each task with
 *      cwd = the package dir), but GitHub resolves an annotation's `file=` against the REPO
 *      ROOT. So which package a line belongs to is not cosmetic — it is the only thing that
 *      makes the annotation land on the right file. Hence `WorkspaceMember`.
 *   2. turbo says which package a line belongs to in TWO different ways, and both must be
 *      read: a per-line `<package-name>:<task>: ` prefix in its streamed mode, and — the
 *      mode CI actually gets — a GROUPED mode where a `<package-name>:<task>` header (bare,
 *      or as `::group::…`) is printed once and the task's own lines follow UNPREFIXED. A
 *      parser that only knew the per-line prefix silently annotated a package-relative path
 *      as if it were repo-relative under CI. Observed, not assumed.
 *   3. tsc emits its plain `path(line,col): error TSxxxx: message` form when stdout is not
 *      a TTY (always so under turbo in CI). The `path:line:col - error …` pretty form is
 *      accepted too, so a TTY-ish runner can't silently turn every annotation off.
