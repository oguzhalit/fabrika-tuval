/**
 * `ci changelog` pure core — the IO-free projection that turns a set
 * of shipped-work entries (closed-issue title + triaged `type:*` label, with a
 * merged-PR backlink) into a Keep a Changelog release section.
 *
 * The changelog is a *derived* artifact: the source of truth is the pipeline's
 * structured metadata (the `type:*` taxonomy from `skills/gh-issue-intake-formats.md`),
 * not the file's own prose. This module owns the one decision the projection rule
 * leaves to the CLI: the `type:*` → Keep-a-Changelog category map (`TYPE_CATEGORY`),
 * unit-tested here. An entry with no recognized `type:*` is mapped to the
 * `Uncategorized` category — surfaced, never silently dropped, because the label set
 * an issue carries is an input this projection does not control.
 *
 * Everything here is total over `ChangelogEntry[]`: `groupByType` buckets by category,
 * `renderSection` renders one `## [version] — date` block, `deriveChangelog` is the
 * top-level `entries → markdown`. The `git log`/`gh` IO that selects the range and
 * gathers entries lives in `bin.ts`; this core never touches the network or disk.
