/**
 * `ci pr-body` pure core — take a standing Release PR body and give back one
 * release-please can still parse.
 *
 * The failure it repairs: release-please copies each commit subject verbatim into the Release PR
 * body's changelog, then on the NEXT run reads that body back through an HTML parser
 * (`PullRequestBody.parse` → `extractMultipleReleases`). One observed commit's subject carried a
 * literal `<details>`, so the parser saw a second `<details>` element with no `<summary>` inside it
 * and `summary.match(...)` threw on `undefined` — every run since has died there, and the frozen
 * Release PR cannot groom. Escaping that one body by hand does not hold: the next green run rebuilds
 * the body from the same commit subject and re-poisons it.
 *
 * So the repair runs every time, before release-please reads: strip the brackets off every
 * HTML-looking tag EXCEPT the two lines release-please writes as structure itself. Those two lines
 * are the whole of its own HTML vocabulary in a manifest PR body — `<details><summary>component:
 * version</summary>` opening a per-package section and `</details>` closing it — so preserving them
 * exactly and neutralizing everything else leaves the parser exactly the elements it wrote.
 *
 * Brackets are stripped rather than entity-escaped because the parsed section text becomes the
 * GitHub Release notes on merge, where `&lt;details&gt;` inside a code span renders literally.
