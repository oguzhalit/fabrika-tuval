/**
 * `ci-required` gate bin — the CI-callable IO shell over `./required.ts`'s pure `judge`
 * verdict: read the declared gating jobs' `needs.*.result` + `*_required`
 * booleans from `process.env`, print the per-job verdicts so the log says what was scanned,
 * exit 0 on PASS / 1 on FAIL.
 *
 * **Not routed through `fabrika`'s bin, and that is the point.** The `ci-required` job runs
 * checkout + setup-node + this file, with no `pnpm install`, so the always-on aggregator stays
 * fast. One `import` of a relative plain-TS module is the whole module graph; an `effect` import
 * anywhere on this path would put the CLI's dependency tree on the gate's critical path.
