/**
 * `ci-required` core — the pure, IO-free verdict for the `ci-required` aggregator.
 *
 * **No `effect` import, here or in `required-bin.ts`.** The `ci-required` gate job runs on every
 * PR and does no `pnpm install`, so its whole entry path must be plain Node the runtime can type-
 * strip with nothing linked. That is why this pair is not a registered `fabrika ci …` verb: a
 * `Command` would put the Effect CLI on the gate's critical path.
 *
 * `ci-required` is the single always-on status context the `main` ruleset
 * requires; the conditional gating jobs (`check`/`unit`/`integration`/`e2e`)
 * each skip on a PR whose changed paths/flags/author they don't cover, so the
 * aggregator must tell a *legitimate not-applicable skip* from a *should-have-run
 * job that was silently skipped* — the latter is a silent no-op, so the aggregator
 * fails closed instead of waving the skip through.
 *
 * The required-ness inputs are single-sourced: the `changes` job emits one
 * `*_required` boolean per gating job, derived from the SAME expression that
 * gates that job's own `if:` (see ci.yml `changes` outputs), so run-ness and
 * required-ness can't drift. No IO — `required-bin.ts` reads the GHA `env:`
 * and prints; this decides.
