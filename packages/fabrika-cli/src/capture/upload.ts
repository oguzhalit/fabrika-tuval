/**
 * The GitHub user-attachments upload leg. Two parts:
 *
 *   - `parseUploadResponse` — the PURE core: given a raw HTTP status + body,
 *     decide whether the endpoint handed back a hosted asset URL or failed, as an
 *     `UploadOutcome` (`hostedUrl` xor `uploadError`). This encodes the FALLBACK
 *     contract (AC: an upload failure is tolerated with a clear diagnostic, never
 *     a silent drop).
 *   - `uploadAsset` — the thin impure Effect: POST the PNG bytes and run the
 *     parser over the response. Its error channel is `never` — every transport /
 *     status / parse failure is CAUGHT and degraded to `{hostedUrl: null,
 *     uploadError}`.
 *
 * The upload is DISPLAY-ONLY and out of the decision path: the gate
 * judges the LOCAL captured bytes (`localPath`) regardless of whether hosting
 * succeeds. A failed upload loses the hosted evidence embed, never the judged
 * image and never the verdict.
 *
 * LOAD-BEARING NOTE — `uploads.github.com/user-attachments/assets` is an
 * UNDOCUMENTED GitHub endpoint (its web-composer internal API), recorded as a
 * known durability risk. It works with a user
 * token today but can change or break without notice. The `uploadError` fallback
 * below is an acceptance criterion, unit-tested, NOT a TODO.
 *
 * What a `2xx` proves, as probed live on 2026-09-23: the bytes are stored and the
 * body is `{"url": "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/<uuid>"}` — no
 * `href`. It does NOT prove that URL opens: a fresh asset reads `404` at its own
 * address, under any credential, until some posted content embeds it. So a caller
 * that needs the asset readable before it posts cannot probe the returned URL; it
 * reads the asset back through GitHub's markdown renderer, the shared read-back in
 * `../io/attachment-read-back.ts` that `review-ui post` and `ui evidence` both run.

 *     `Invalid name for request` that left every `hostedUrl` null. The
 *     `content-disposition: attachment; filename="…"` header does NOT supply it —
 *     the endpoint ignores that header entirely, which is why the header-only
 *     request always 400'd.
 *   - `content_type` — the query param wins over the request's `content-type`
 *     header. Absent it, GitHub derives the type from the header, so an
 *     `application/octet-stream` body 422s twice over: the type is not in the
 *     allowed list, AND `.png` does not match it.
 *   - `size` — optional (a request without it is accepted), but sent because the
