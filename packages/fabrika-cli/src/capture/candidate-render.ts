/**
 * The candidate-render step: render the priority surfaces over a flag-forced preview

 *
 * Thin orchestration over pure cores: resolve the priority surfaces
 * (`priority-surfaces.ts`), shoot them over the preview via the reused capture leg
 * (`capture.ts` — the same flake canon the review-design gate uses), PUT each
 * candidate's bytes to the asset store up front (so the emitted `sha256` IS what a
 * later bless commits — the no-re-render guard), and fold the results into the candidate
 * set (`candidate-set.ts`). Both impure legs are injected seams — the unit test
 * drives the whole orchestration with fakes, no browser and no store (the
 * pure-core + injected-impure-leg idiom `renderLocal`/`captureAndUpload` already use).
