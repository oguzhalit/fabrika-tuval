/**
 * The pure capture-plan core: parse the review-design skill's `--surface`

 * flat list of screenshots to shoot. No browser, no network — this is the
 * unit-tested selection logic the review-design gate reasons about;
 * `capture.ts` drives Playwright over the plan this produces.
 *
 * One record per surface per viewport: a surface is a route + an optional state
 * variant, and a plan shoots that set at one viewport. A caller wanting several
 * viewports builds a plan per viewport and concatenates them — the file name
 * carries the viewport label, so the shots never collide.
 *
 * The grammar here parses ANY state token; which ones a capture can actually put
 * on screen is `states.ts`'s closed list (`auth` today), and `review-ui render`
 * refuses the rest on `10`. Parsing a state is not rendering one.
