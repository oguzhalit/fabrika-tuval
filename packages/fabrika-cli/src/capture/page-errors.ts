/**
 * The render-crash signal the review-design gate fails on.
 *
 * A single screenshot only sees pixels. A mount/init race — e.g. a read-only rich-text
 * editor's `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'commands')`, thrown when
 * `setContent` runs before the editor instance exists —
 * throws a runtime exception into the page on a "bad tick" while the captured
 * frame still looks acceptable. The six visual prohibitions never see it, so the
 * gate green-lit a component that hard-crashes for a fraction of loads. The fix:
 * the capture render also LISTENS for runtime errors, and a thrown uncaught
 * exception is a hard FAIL regardless of how the frame looks.
 *
 * This is the pure classification + failure-formatting core (`capture.ts` wires
 * the Playwright `pageerror`/`console` listeners that feed it; the review-design
 * skill reads each surface's `pageErrors` to decide the deterministic FAIL). An
 * uncaught `pageerror` is the crash signal; a `console.error` is captured too but
 * only advises — console.error is noisy in dev (React key/prop warnings), so
 * failing on it would trip the gate on benign output, against its
 * fail-conservative calibration.
