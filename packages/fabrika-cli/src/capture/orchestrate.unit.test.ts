/**
 * The capture→upload merge (`mergeRecord`) — the correctness core of the reshape:
 * the judged image (`localPath`) is ALWAYS carried onto the record, decoupled
 * from the upload. The load-bearing invariant is that the upload FALLBACK path
 * (endpoint down) still yields a record with `localPath` — losing the image
 * exactly when the undocumented endpoint fails is what this reshape fixes.
