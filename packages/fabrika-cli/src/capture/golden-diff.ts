/**
 * The deterministic rendered-vs-golden visual diff (pure core). This is the
 * DIFF half of the calibration: it produces the *signal* — a structured
 * per-surface deviation (magnitude + the differing regions) — never the verdict.
 * The judgment escalation ("is this deviation acceptable?") is the review gate's;
 * here we only measure, deterministically, so the same two images always yield
 * the same result (the AC the review gate anchors on).
 *
 * Flake-canon split: the capture-time half of the canon —
 * animations disabled, reduced-motion, `document.fonts.ready` awaited, srgb
 * forced, seeded data + frozen clock — is enforced when the bytes are RENDERED
 * (the render harness / capture options), so it is out of this pure core.
 * The DIFF-time half of the canon lives here: known-dynamic regions are MASKED out
 * of the comparison (`DiffOptions.masks`) so a legitimately-varying region (a
 * relative timestamp, an avatar) never reads as a deviation.
 *
 * Operates on already-decoded rasters (RGBA row-major) so it needs no PNG codec
 * and stays a pure, unit-tested total function; decoding candidate/golden PNG
 * bytes into a `RasterImage` is the caller's boundary.
