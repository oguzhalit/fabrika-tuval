/**
 * `@kampus/fabrika-cli/capture` — the screenshot/render/golden-diff machinery the
 * design gates drive. It lives here, on fabrika's release train, so an adopter repo
 * gets it with fabrika instead of depending on a package published out of somebody
 * else's repo.
 *
 * The repo-specific DATA stays per-repo, and that boundary is what decides where a
 * module lives. Anything naming a *host* or a *credential* — the store/fetch of golden
 * bytes, the pointer file, the harness config — is the consuming repo's and is NOT here.
 * That is not only a taste call: this package is published, so a dependency on a private
 * package could not resolve from a clean registry (`publish-isolation-guard` enforces
 * it). Storing bytes is therefore an injected `StoreLeg` here — the shape, never the
 * store.
 *
 * `captureAndUpload` and its request/result types live in `./orchestrate.ts`.
 * `resolvePreviewUrl` reads the sticky preview-deploy comment by its per-app anchor.
