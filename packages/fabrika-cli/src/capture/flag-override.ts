/**
 * Force a flag for a capture, so a dark-shipped surface paints the state the PR actually adds.
 * Pure — no browser, no network; `capture.ts` seeds the cookie this builds and
 * hands the probe's raw answer back to {@link readOverrideProof}.
 *
 * The mechanism is the app's existing flag-override cookie and nothing new. The wire
 * value is `encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify({key: boolean}))`, which is exactly what the
 * worker's override-cookie parser reads back, and the gate that decides whether to honor it is
 * untouched: on a deployed stage it answers `true` only for a request whose actor holds platform
 * admin. So a forced capture is an authorized admin's capture or it is nothing.
 *
 * "Or it is nothing" is why the proof exists. A dropped cookie renders the flag-off page cleanly,
 * which is a valid PNG under the flag-on name — the same shape as a dropped session cookie
 * shooting the signed-out page under the signed-in name, and no byte check can tell the two apart.
