/**
 * The golden POINTER — the committed git metadata mapping a capture surface-id to
 * its current blessed golden. The golden BYTES live in a content-addressed, immutable
 * asset store; git carries ONLY this tiny pointer,
 * so a re-bless is a one-line reviewable diff and history never bloats with PNGs.
 *
 * This is the committed-baseline + `bless` idiom a migrations guard uses: the
 * pointer file is the audited baseline, `blessSurface` is the deliberate re-bless,
 * and the store's write-once immutability IS
 * the "explicit update, never silent overwrite" guarantee —
 * a re-bless is a new sha256 → new store URL → a pointer move, never an in-place
 * overwrite of live bytes.
 *
 * Pure + IO-free (the unit-tested resolution/bless logic), and dependency-free so
 * the pure test never has to load a store client: the fs load/serialize boundary
 * lives in `golden-fs.ts`, and the store URL/store/fetch boundary — including
 * `resolveGoldenUrl` (sha256 → immutable store URL) — is the consuming repo's.
