/**
 * The blessing surface: the human-in-the-loop bless → commit path on top of the
 * candidate set and the golden pointer. It renders the operator-facing GitHub gallery
 * comment from a candidate set, and folds the operator's per-surface approve/redline
 * verdicts into a golden-pointer move — blessing the approved candidates, leaving the
 * redlined ones out.
 *
 * Load-bearing guard — commit the EXACT approved bytes, no re-render: a bless is a
 * POINTER MOVE. `applyBlessing` takes each blessed surface's `sha256` ONLY from the
 * candidate set the operator saw in the gallery — the `BlessDecision` carries a verdict,
 * never a sha — so the committed content-address is provably the one the operator
 * approved. The store's write-once immutability is then the "explicit update, never
 * silent overwrite" guarantee for free.
 *
 * Pure + IO-free: gallery render, decision parse, and blessing fold are all
 * deterministic (unit-tested — same inputs → same output). The fs/pointer boundary is
 * `golden-fs.ts`; the asset-store boundary is the consuming repo's; this module touches
 * neither.
