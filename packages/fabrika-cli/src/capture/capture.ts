/**
 * The impure Playwright leg: drive a headless chromium over a capture plan,
 * write each surface's PNG to disk, and return the bytes + the on-disk path.
 * Thin by design — the plan selection (`plan.ts`) and the upload classification
 * (`upload.ts`) hold the unit-tested logic; this file launches a browser, visits
 * each `Shot.url` at its viewport, screenshots it, and persists it.
 *
 * `localPath` is the PRIMARY judged artifact, so capture ALWAYS
 * produces it on success — losing it is never acceptable. Each capture also
 * collects the runtime errors thrown into the page during the render
 * (`pageErrors`) — the crash signal the gate fails on (see `page-errors.ts`).
