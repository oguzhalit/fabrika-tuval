 * Resolve an app's preview base URL from the sticky preview-deploy PR comment.

 * its own block under a per-app `<!-- preview-deploy:<app> -->` anchor followed by
 * a human line `- **<app>** — Stage \`pr-<n>\` → <url> …`. `ci.yml` already
 * resolves the web URL by keying off `<!-- preview-deploy:web -->` (its `webRe`).
 *
 * We MUST key off the per-app anchor, NOT grab the first `workers.dev` URL in the
 * comment: a blind first-match breaks the moment a second app's preview line is
 * present (it would return the wrong app's URL). This resolver bounds the scan to
 * the target app's own block (from its anchor up to the next app anchor).
