/**
 * One load of the config surface from the working tree — the door for a verb that runs against the
 * checkout it is standing in rather than against a base ref.
 *
 * Kept apart from `./load.ts`, which knows nothing about files: a verb reading at a ref
 * (`build clearances`) opens the bytes with `git show` and hands the same loader a `Text`. This is
 * the other opener, and the only platform-touching module on the surface. The machine-local layer is
 * read only by working-tree openers and never at a ref, because that file exists nowhere but a
 * working tree: {@link loadRepoConfig} here, and `status settings`, which opens both layers through
 * {@link repoConfigLayers} or, under `--root`, `./source.ts`'s `readConfigLayers`.
 *
 * **An absent file and an unreadable one stay apart all the way down.** Absent is a repo that
 * declared nothing, so every key resolves to its shipped default; a read that failed proves nothing
 * about what the repo declared, and each key resolves UNKNOWN so its caller refuses in its own words.
