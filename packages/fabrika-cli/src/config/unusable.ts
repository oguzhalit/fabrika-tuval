/**
 * Why no value of one load may be used, or `null` — the question a gate asks before it writes.
 *
 * A load that is not `Refused` is not thereby a load that decoded. `Refused` is the narrow arm a
 * key's `refuseLoad` raises over a config it *could* read; a file nobody could open, a file that is
 * not a JSON object, and a key whose value the decoder rejected — that last one only where the key
 * carries no `refuseLoad`, since a key that does have one refuses the load on its own `Malformed`
 * too — all answer `Config`, because the arms live per key in {@link Resolution} rather than on the
 * load. Reading `_tag === "Config"` as "it loaded" is what let `triage apply` reach the label write
 * with the containment check never run: a gate keyed on the refusal alone is fail-open on exactly
 * the input class this surface exists to keep apart.
 *
 * The two document-level arms are worded here rather than relayed from the state, because at that
 * level every key carries the same reason and a per-key attribution would be false — the file is
 * unreadable, not `triageFacets`. A key's own `Malformed` reason is relayed verbatim: it already
 * names its key, and the decoder's words are the ones that repair the file.
