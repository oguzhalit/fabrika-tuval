/**
 * One key of the config surface, read off the checkout a verb is standing in.
 *
 * The note names the layer a value came from, so a reader debugging a number sees which of the two
 * files to open. A value whose source is invisible is one an operator debugs blind, which is the
 * cost the old hand-edit of the tracked file at least made visible in `git status`.
 *
 * Every reader wants the same three things — the value, a sentence naming where it came from, and a
 * refusal it can print verbatim — so the four resolution arms collapse here once instead of at each
 * call site. **`Malformed` and `Unknown` both refuse**: a value nobody could decode and a file
 * nobody could read are equally not an answer, and neither may fall back to the shipped default it
 * did not resolve to. Falling back is how a typo in `.fabrika.jsonc` silently restores the shipped
 * defaults in a repo that declared something else.
 *
 * Per key rather than a whole-surface read: a verb that needs the standing lanes has no business
 * refusing over a malformed `cycleDoc` it never opens. The whole-config gate that *does* refuse on
 * any key is `./unusable.ts`, and it stays the write path's gate.
