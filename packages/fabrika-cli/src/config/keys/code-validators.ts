/**
 * `codeValidators` — the repo's own commands that compile and lint its code.
 *
 * Declared rather than compiled in, because the script names and the flags they take are the repo's
 * own: `typecheck:affected` and `lint:worktree` are one repo's script names, and the turbo flags
 * they wrap — a cache-bypass, a changed-package selection — are ones a bare `tsc` rejects outright.
 * An argv array rather than a command line, and the `command` key `workflowValidators` already
 * uses, so the file has one grammar for "a command fabrika spawns".
 *
 * No `reads`. On the workflow surface that field is what makes a green checkable per file, because
 * a declared guard opens a fixed set it names; a code validator is handed no paths and compiles the
 * tree, so a per-file list here would be a claim nothing could hold it to.
 *
 * **The shipped default is empty, and every repo declares its own pair.** Emptiness
 * costs nothing here that it costs a gate-scope key: an empty list has nothing runnable, so
 * `build check --surface code` refuses UNKNOWN on it — never green, and never `VALIDATION_RED`,
 * which stays reserved for a validator that ran and failed. Defaulting to any repo's pair instead
 * leaves an adopting repo running script names it never defined: a repo that declared nothing got
 * `pnpm typecheck --force`, and `tsc` rejected the turbo flag outright — a red saying its code was
 * broken when the truth was that no validator was present. The repo that shipped that pair has
 * since dropped the flag and scoped its typecheck to the changed packages; the incident stands as
 * why the shipped default is empty, not as what any one repo runs.
