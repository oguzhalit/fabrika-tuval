/**
 * The path surface — where this repo keeps the three files and directories fabrika reads by name.
 *
 * One module for three keys, because they are one question asked three times: the decision corpus,
 * the roadmap declaration and the cycle doc. `governedRoots` is the fourth path key and lives in
 * `./governed-roots.ts`, which shipped ahead of this one; the two stay apart so this module can be
 * written without touching it.
 *
 * **Absent is not declined.** An absent key resolves to the shipped value, so a repo that declares
 * nothing behaves exactly as it did before the key existed. An explicitly declined key resolves to
 * "this repo has no such surface" and the verbs that read it degrade in the way their own contract
 * declares — which is a different answer from a path that is simply not there yet.
 *
 * Only {@link decisionsDirKey} is declinable, and the asymmetry is deliberate. A repo with no
 * decision corpus changes what `governance` may conclude and what `adr` may write, so the absence
 * has to be *declared* before those verbs will act on it. The other two name files whose readers
 * already answer "no such file" from the filesystem — `build pick` on a missing roadmap — so a
 * decline key there would be a second way to say what the tree already says.
