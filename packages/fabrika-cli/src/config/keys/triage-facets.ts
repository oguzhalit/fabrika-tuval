/**
 * `triageFacets` — what each triage facet owns, and every label an input can make it keep.
 *
 * The shipped default is taken straight off `triage/facets.ts` rather than restated here, so a bare
 * repo reconciles on exactly the values that module already carries.
 *
 * **The containment invariant is this key's `refuseLoad`, and that seat is the point.** A facet is
 * delete authority: `owns` strips every label it matches that the keep set does not name, so a
 * facet with no naming counterpart strips an issue's only priority. Checked at a call site, the
 * rule is one a new verb can forget; checked here, every reader of a loaded config inherits it and
 * a violating config is refused before any write path is reachable. The rule itself, and why it
 * refuses in one direction for a pattern and both for a set, is `../containment.ts`.
 *
 * This module ships the key, its default and that refusal. Reading the *values* off it at the
 * reconcile's call sites — so a repo can actually declare its own board vocabulary — is separate
 * work.
