/**
 * `governedRoots` — the roots a diff derives the `governance` namespace over.
 *
 * The shipped default is three roots plus `.fabrika.jsonc` itself: a diff that weakens the config
 * owes a governance verdict like any other governance-corpus change. Every shipped root is one the
 * tool itself reads or writes in any repo, so a repo that keeps governed text elsewhere — its own
 * plugin tree, say — declares that root.
 *
 * **That self-inclusion is enforced at load, not by convention.** A config can edit its own
 * governed-path list, so a config whose roots do not cover `.fabrika.jsonc` could un-govern itself —
 * the one change nobody would ever be asked to justify. {@link governedRootsKey}'s `refuseLoad`
 * refuses the whole load in that case, naming the key — and a declared value that does not decode
 * at all refuses it too, since an unusable root list un-governs the config just as effectively.
 *
 * This module ships the key, its default and that refusal, and every path surface that derives the
 * namespace reads it from here — at the PR's head and merge base through `review/class-config.ts`
 * (`review scope`, `review diff`, `governance scope` and `post`, the three `ship` verbs, `heal-ci`,
 * `lane prove`), and off the working tree only for `review preview` over a diff file.
