/**
 * `assemblyRefresh` — whether the driver refreshes an epic's assembly branch before the two moments
 * a shell is sent at it.
 *
 * Two sub-keys, one per automatic call. `onReview` says what `lane refresh --on-review` does on the
 * tail's way into review; `onDispatch` says what the pre-dispatch call inside `lane dispatch` does
 * before a child shell is cut from the branch. `off` declines and merges nothing, `on` performs the
 * merge. The verb called by hand is never gated — a driver that types `lane refresh <epic>` means
 * it, and the key exists to decide whether the *automatic* calls happen at all.
 *
 * Both arms are read out of the repository that OWNS the cwd
 * ([`configRootOrRefuse`](../../lane/ground.ts)) rather than the cwd itself, because both gate a
 * merge into the assembly branch that repository's lane ledger tracks — and `onDispatch` is read
 * from a driver whose cwd is routinely a linked worktree.
 *
 * **Both ship `off`, which is today's behaviour byte for byte.** Each is a new step on a path every
 * epic run walks, and a step that merges trunk into an assembly branch changes what the tail review
 * binds to and which tree a child builds in. So a repo turns each on for itself, and a repo that
 * declares nothing keeps the path it already has.
