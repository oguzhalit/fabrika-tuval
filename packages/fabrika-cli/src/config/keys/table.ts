/**
 * `table` — the weekly betting table: its cadence, its agenda, and every threshold its flags read.
 *
 * One key group, many sub-keys, each with its own shipped default. **An absent block is a working
 * table**: config only tunes it. A declared block that leaves a sub-key out gets that sub-key's
 * shipped value, so a repo writes only the numbers it disagrees with.
 *
 * The dollars each size is worth are not a sub-key: they are `appetiteSizes`, the key pitch-guard
 * reads, so the table and a pitch approval never name two amounts for one size.
 *
 * No shipped value names a repository, path, issue number or login. The one per-repo fact the table
 * needs, which project it lives in, defaults to `null`: `table setup` finds or creates the project
 * on the repository's own owner.
 *
 * A malformed sub-key refuses the whole block rather than falling back, because a threshold silently
 * restored to the shipped number is one the operator believes they set and did not.
 *
