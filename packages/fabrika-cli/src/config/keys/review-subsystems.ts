/**
 * `reviewSubsystems` — the path globs whose matched files carry an additive review constraint.
 *
 * One row per subsystem: a glob (`pattern`), the subsystem's name, and the constraint text a
 * reviewer applies on top of the class rubric. `review scope` matches the PR's changed files
 * against the patterns and prints a `subsystem` row per subsystem with matches beside its
 * `subsystem-note` — **additive constraints, never a partition**: a path matching several patterns
 * counts under each subsystem, because the rows layer constraints onto the base class rubrics
 * (`code`, `doc`, `skill`, `ui`) rather than carving the diff up.
 *
 * The shipped default is the empty list, and it is the whole point of the key: a repo that declares
 * no subsystems gets exactly the scope output it got before — nothing is opt-out by default, and no
 * constraint text ships for anybody's code.
 *
 * This module ships the key, its default and its decode, and `review scope` reads it at the PR's
 * head and merge base through `review/class-config.ts`. A key group knows nothing about files, so
 * the matching itself lives in the verb that reads the value, over the one glob grammar the package
 * ships (`review/filter-spike.ts`'s `patternToMatcher` — the same engine the review filter spike
 * uses, so a repo never learns two dialects).
