/**
 * `laneConcurrencyCap` — how many issue lanes this repo lets a driver hold at once.
 *
 * A seat is a lane somebody is driving: active on its own log AND claimed on its issue, plus every
 * lane no read can account for. See [`concurrency.ts`](../../lane/concurrency.ts) for the counting.
 *
 * "Cap at 2 for the rest of the night" was a spoken instruction, so it bound only the operator who
 * heard it and only for as long as they remembered it. Declared here it binds the boot itself:
 * `lane open` and `lane emit` count the seats before they write, and refuse past the number.
 *
 * Both read it out of the repository that OWNS the cwd rather than the cwd itself
 * ([`configRootOrRefuse`](../../lane/ground.ts)), because the seats are counted in that repository's
 * one shared ledger: a linked worktree's own tracked copy would cap a count it contributed nothing
 * to.
 *
 * **The shipped default is `null` — no cap.** A repo that declares nothing is not capped, matching
 * every other shipped default on this surface, which declines rather than guessing a number that
 * fits somebody else's machine. `null` is also writable, and means the same thing said out loud.
 *
 * A declared value is a **positive integer**: `0` would be a cap no boot could ever clear, and a
 * fraction or a numeric string is a value the writer did not mean. All of them refuse at load rather
 * than round, because a cap silently repaired to a different number is one the operator believes
 * they set and did not.
 *
 * **The one key a machine may declare in `.fabrika.local.jsonc`** (`machineLocal`). A seat count is
 * a property of the laptop holding the seats, not of the repository, so the number stops living in
 * a tracked file a driving worktree then carries as modified for a whole run. Nothing about the cap
 * itself softens: there is still no override flag and no environment variable, and a booting lane
 * cannot argue past the number it reads — only where that number may be *declared* moves.
