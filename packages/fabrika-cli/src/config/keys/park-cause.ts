/**
 * `parkCause` — what a repo does with a lane park: one that names no cause, one whose cause
 * routes to the driver, and a spent repair budget.
 *
 * Three sub-keys. `uncaused` says whether a cause-less park is refused before the log is touched,
 * or recorded as a bare `BLOCKED`. `driverRouted` says whether `recipe unpark` may clear a park whose cause routes `driver`
 * on the driver's own recorded rationale, or refuses it the way it always did. `repairBudgetSpent`
 * says whose park a spent repair budget is: the driver's, which grants the next round itself, or
 * the founder's, which parks the task on a human like any other founder-routed park.
 *
 * The two verbs that record a park — `lane transition` and `lane report` — and the one that
 * clears it, `recipe unpark`, resolve it out of the repository that OWNS the cwd
 * ([`configRootOrRefuse`](../../lane/ground.ts)), because the rule is weighed against that
 * repository's one shared lane ledger: a linked worktree's tracked copy would decide which parks
 * reach, or leave, a log it does not own.
 *
 * **`uncaused` ships as `refuse`.** A cause-less park folds to a `Novel` park no recipe keys on, so
 * it costs a human `UNBLOCKED` to say a thing the recorder already knew — and a repo that adopts
 * fabrika and declares nothing would get that on every driver hold. The cost of the strict value is
 * a hold with no fitting cause token: it cannot be parked at all, so the lane stays in its stage
 * until a token exists. A repo that prefers the bare park declares `record`.
 *
 * **`driverRouted` ships as `refuse`.** Taking the founder out of the engine loop is what the route
 * field on a park cause is for, and it is still a repo's call to make: a repo whose shells do not
 * name their causes yet would see the clearing reach almost nothing, so the flip waits until that
 * repo asks for it.
 *
 * **`repairBudgetSpent` ships as `driver`.** That is the route the `repair-budget-spent` cause
 * carried before any repo could declare one, so a repo declaring nothing keeps it. A repo that wants
 * every spent budget in front of a person declares `founder`. Either way the pull-request half of the
 * grant is still gated by the control-plane set `.github/CODEOWNERS` names: this key says whose call
 * the round is, not which account may record it.
