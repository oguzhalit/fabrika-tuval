/**
 * `ci` — what fabrika may assume about the repo's continuous-integration producer.
 *
 * Three sub-keys, one question each. `noProducer` says what a repo with **zero Actions workflows**
 * gets — zero repo-authored `.github/workflows/*` workflows, because the platform-provided
 * `dynamic/<provider>/<name>` entries GitHub lists for default CodeQL setup, Dependabot and the
 * Copilot reviewer do not count; `gateWorkflow` is the filename fabrika names when it points a reader at the gate that
 * supersedes an in-tree prediction; `mainAlarm` is who the main-went-red alarm wakes and which
 * label carries its issue.
 *
 * **Workflow existence is the whole test, and nothing here inspects what a workflow does.** The
 * rule is deliberate — no job-name matching, no expected set, because any such set is a second
 * place the repo's CI shape is written down and a second place it drifts.
 *
 * **The shipped default is `refuse`, and that is today's behaviour, not a new strictness.** A repo
 * with no producer cannot evidence anything about a head, so a rollup over its empty enumeration is
 * vacuous. A repo that knowingly runs no Actions workflows declares `degrade` for
 * itself; the default never quietly greens on the repo that simply forgot to set up CI.
 *
