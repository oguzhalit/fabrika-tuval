/**
 * `dependencyReconciler` — the repo's own command that installs what its lockfile pins.
 *
 * An epic's assembly worktree is placed once and merged into many times. A child that adds a
 * workspace package moves the lockfile, and the tree's installed dependencies still predate it, so
 * the validators that run next compile against the pre-merge install: one such merge failed
 * `pnpm typecheck --force` with `TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'node'` and passed
 * every typecheck after an install, with no source or lockfile change.
 *
 * Declared rather than compiled in, for the reason `codeValidators` is: the command is the repo's
 * package manager and its own fail-closed flag — `--frozen-lockfile` is pnpm's, and a repo on
 * another manager spells the same intent differently. Same `command` argv grammar, so the file has
 * one shape for "a command fabrika spawns".
 *
 * **The shipped default is nothing declared, and nothing declared skips the step.** Unlike a
 * validator's absence, which refuses UNKNOWN because a green would claim the code was checked, an
 * absent reconciler claims nothing: a repo that vendors no dependencies has no install to run, and
 * refusing every epic integration in it would be a fence around an empty field. What a repo
 * declares is the whole guarantee for that repo.
