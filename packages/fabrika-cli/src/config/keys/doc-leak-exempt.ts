/**
 * `docLeakExempt` — the docs whose subject IS path hygiene, as repo-relative path suffixes.
 *
 * `build check --surface prose` skips its leak scan on them. Repo policy, since those docs differ
 * repo by repo and fabrika installs into repos it does not control. The shipped default
 * is the empty list — **nothing is exempt** — so a repo that declared none leaves the scanner at its
 * strictest rather than inheriting somebody else's carve-outs.
