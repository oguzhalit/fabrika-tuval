/**
 * `containmentVocabulary` — which child types are asked for a `**Containment:**` marker, and which
 * values satisfy it.
 *
 * Declared rather than compiled in, because containment is a *deployment* story and fabrika installs
 * into repos that have a different one or none at all. A repo that dark-ships reads `flag` or
 * `exempt`; a library repo might ask for `unpublished` or `exempt`; a repo with no deployment story
 * asks for nothing.
 *
 * **The shipped default is a dark-ship pair, and it is deliberately not empty.** An empty default
 * would retire a gate for every repo that never declared anything, which is the one direction this
 * surface never moves in.
 *
 * **An empty half means the marker is never required.** A repo turning containment off empties
 * either list, and both readers stop asking — that is the graceful absence a repo with no
 * deployment story needs, and it is a declaration rather than the side effect of a missing file.
 *
 * This module owns the whole containment judgment — the read and the gap — because `ledger child`
 * and the plan floor both make it, and two derivations of "which types, which values" are two
 * chances to answer one question differently.
