/**
 * The board vocabulary — the five label sets triage reconciles over — and how each facet's delete
 * authority is derived from them.
 *
 * Pure: it imports the containment rule and nothing else, because `../triage/facets.ts` imports
 * *this* to build the shipped default. The load-side composition (which needs the key modules) is
 * `./resolve-board.ts`.
 *
 * **Statuses are roles, not a list.** A repo renaming `status:triaged` has to say *which* status it
 * renamed — a five-entry array cannot, and positional meaning is the kind of invalid state this
 * package refuses to represent. Types, priorities, audiences and lanes are open lists: nothing in
 * the reconcile needs to know which member is which.
 *
 * **The pipeline still recognises two stems by name**: the type `epic` (its deliverable is a ledger,
 * not a PR) and the audience `agent` (the acceptance-criteria promise is made to one). A repo may
 * add members and rename the others; renaming those two away drops the behaviour they carry.
