/**
 * One load's board vocabulary and the facet table that reconciles it — the shape every board reader
 * takes.
 *
 * Two keys answer one question, so one module joins them: `boardVocabulary` says what each facet may
 * keep, `triageFacets` says what each facet may delete. Read apart they drift into the state a
 * declared lane no facet owns is written once and never superseded, so the join runs the
 * containment invariant over the *composed* table and refuses there.
 *
 * Kept out of `./board.ts` because that module is what `../triage/facets.ts` builds the shipped
 * default from; importing the key modules there would close a cycle.
