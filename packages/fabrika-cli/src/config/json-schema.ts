/**
 * The document-level JSON Schemas for the two config files, assembled from the per-key fragments.
 *
 * Each key group carries its own `jsonSchema` fragment beside its `decode`, so the shape a repo
 * hand-edits is described in the one place its decoder already lives. This module joins the registry's
 * fragments into one draft-07 document an editor validates the file against — a red squiggle on a
 * misspelled key or a wrong-typed value, where the only feedback used to be a decode failure at
 * runtime.
 *
 * **A registered key with no fragment refuses the assembly whole.** A schema missing one key's
 * properties would green a typo in that key's subtree, which is the silent gap this schema exists to
 * close; so an incomplete registry is named, never emitted over.
 *
 * The machine-local document is the same assembly narrowed to the keys a machine may declare, so an
 * editor reds an ineligible key where it is typed rather than at the next verb run.
 *
