/**
 * The containment invariant, as a check over declared data rather than over compiled-in constants.
 *
 * A triage facet is **delete authority, not naming**: every label its `owns` matches and its keep set
 * does not is removed. When the two disagree a well-formed run strips an issue's only priority and
 * prints a success line. The invariant that stops it: *the set of values an
 * input can produce must be a subset of what its facet owns.*
 *
 * Once the vocabulary is configuration, a test over constants proves nothing about what a repo
 * loaded, so the check lives here and runs at load. It refuses in two directions, and the asymmetry
 * is the whole design:
 *
 * - **A declared value its facet does not own is always refused.** Such a value is written and then
 *   never superseded, because the facet has no authority to remove it — two priorities coexist and
 *   every queue read downstream picks whichever it sees first.
 * - **An enumerated facet that owns a label no declared value produces is refused too.** Every extra
 *   member of a literal list is delete authority with no naming counterpart, which is exactly how a
 *   facet strips a label nothing can put back.
 * - **A pattern wider than its values is not refused**, because that width is deliberate and not
 *   decidable anyway: `^p\d+$` owns `p3` so a priority retired from the vocabulary is still cleaned
 *   up, and no finite check can enumerate a regex's language to prove otherwise.
