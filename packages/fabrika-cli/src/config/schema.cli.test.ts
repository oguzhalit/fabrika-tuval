/**
 * The committed `.fabrika.schema.json` is reconciled where a merge can be blocked.
 *
 * A reconcile verb nobody invokes reds only when a person happens to run it, and the stale document
 * it fails to catch ships `"additionalProperties": false` — so an adopter's editor reds a key that is
 * in fact valid. This test is that invocation: the `packages unit tests` CI job runs it on
 * every PR that touches the registry or the committed file, and a stale file fails the job.
 *
 * It runs the real verb in a subprocess against this checkout, because the answer only exists at the
 * process boundary — the verb resolves the repo root from its cwd, which an in-process call fakes.
