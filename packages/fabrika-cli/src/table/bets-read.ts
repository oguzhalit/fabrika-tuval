/**
 * Read the repository's table project: the bet order a verb ranks work by, or any other reader
 * handed to {@link readTableWith}.
 *
 * The project is found the way `table setup` finds it, read-only: the number `table.project` names,
 * or else the one open project linked to the repository under the table's title. **No project is an
 * answer, not a failure**: a repository that never set a table up gets `NoTable`, and its caller
 * behaves exactly as it did before tables existed.
 *
 * A table that could not be read splits on whether the repository adopted one (`./adoption.ts`).
 * Not adopted, any failed read — a missing scope, a rate limit, an outage, a forbidden token — is
 * `NoTable` with the reason in its note, rather than a new refusal on every verb that ranks work.
 * Adopted, a missing scope is `NoTable` too, its note naming the fix `table setup` names; every
 * other failed read is `Unknown`.
