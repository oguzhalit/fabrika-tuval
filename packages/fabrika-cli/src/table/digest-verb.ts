/**
 * `table digest` — post the issues past their response target to the chat webhook the repository's
 * `digest` block names.
 *
 * With no `digest` block it reads nothing and sends nothing. The triage section reads the open
 * issues alone. The on-call section also reads both boards, so it needs a token that can read the
 * projects.
 *
 * **An issue is on-call once the routing rule says so, not once someone placed it.** The section
 * lists the on-call board's open items and every open issue `boards.onCall.route` sends there that
 * `table route` has yet to place, picked by the `onCallIssuesOf` route and prep use. Nothing on a
 * schedule runs route, so a list of placed items alone would miss the issue filed overnight.
 *
 * **A source it could not read is a refusal, never an empty report**, and so is a post that did not
 * land: a scheduled run that goes quiet has to mean nothing is late.
 *
 * **The webhook URL reaches the post and nothing else.** It is read from the environment variable
 * the block names, and every line this verb prints about a failed post has the URL struck from it.
