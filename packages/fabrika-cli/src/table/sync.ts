/**
 * What `table sync` writes, as data. Pure, so "a second run writes nothing" is a property of
 * {@link planSync} — a project already in step plans no write — rather than of a live run.
 *
 * Two questions, answered in order. {@link scope} decides which issues the run touches and which of
 * them head a group row. {@link planSync} then decides every write against the rows as they read.
 *
 * The rules the plan holds:
 * - **Rows are real issues only.** The one add is an issue by number, so no draft item can be made,
 *   and a closed issue that is not already a row is never added.
 * - **A person's Stage stands.** Sync writes only `in lane` and `shipped`, and only over an unset
 *   Stage or one of those. `bet` and `not now` are a person's answer at the table; `check` belongs
 *   to the outcome check. Sync overwrites none of them.
 * - **Spent $ and Asks start at the bet.** On a row whose Stage is `bet`, only lanes ending at or
 *   after that value's `updatedAt` count, so a new bet starts at 0.
 * - **Spent $ is a number only when every counted lane measured it.** One unmeasured lane leaves the
 *   cell empty, and clears a number standing there, so no row reads a spend nobody measured.
 * - **A group row sums its members, and its members carry no Section**, so they show only in the
 *   members view. A head with no Section, no `bet` and at least one lane lands under Outside the bets.
 * - **A bet row is never a member**, so sync never clears its Section. It heads its own row even
 *   when it blocks, or hangs under, another row, and that other row does not sum it.
 *
