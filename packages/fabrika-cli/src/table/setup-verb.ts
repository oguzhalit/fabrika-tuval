/**
 * `table setup` — find or create the repository's table project and bring it to the table's shape.
 *
 * The run is three passes over one plan: create the missing fields, re-read, add the options and
 * blank descriptions a standing field lacks and align views and the README against the fields that
 * now exist, re-read, and plan once more. **That last plan must be
 * empty**: it is the read-back, and it is also what makes a second run answer `unchanged` — the same
 * function that proves this run landed decides the next run has nothing to do.
 *
 * A conflict refuses before anything is written to the project. A project this run created or linked
 * is still named in that refusal, so a re-run after the conflict is fixed finds it rather than creating a
 * second one.
 *
 * A missing view is created over REST with its grouping, since GraphQL's view input takes none. A view
 * that already stands keeps the grouping it has.
