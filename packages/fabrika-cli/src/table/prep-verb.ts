/**
 * `table prep` — fill the next table's agenda, carry the running bets to it, bring the bets shipped
 * long enough ago back as checks, and post the week's health as the project's status update. Every
 * row it touches is dated with the next table's day in the Table day field.
 *
 * Everything is read before anything is written: the rows and their lane records the way
 * `table flags` reads them, the status updates already posted, the open board, and each check's evidence. Check comments post first, so a re-run
 * after a later write fails still finds them and posts none twice. The row writes then run like
 * `table sync`'s: adds first, the rows re-read so each new item has an id, then the cells, then a
 * last read whose plan must be empty. The status update goes last, so it stands only over an agenda
 * that landed whole.
 *
 * **One prep per table.** The update names its table day, and once one stands the agenda is
 * closed: a second run adds no row, carries no bet and posts nothing. It still takes a `proposed`
 * row whose issue closed off the table, since that row must not reach the table.
 *
 * **Prep never routes.** It reads the on-call board to leave routed issues off the agenda and to
 * report on-call as one section of the update, and it leaves their table rows standing. Placing
 * them and taking their rows off is `table route`'s, which runs on any schedule without closing an
 * agenda, so an issue routed by its row's Origin is never on neither board.
 *
 * `--dry-run` runs this same path over a board that records its writes (`dry-run.ts`).
