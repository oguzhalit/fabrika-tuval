/**
 * What `table route`, `table prep` and `table flags` do with the on-call board a `boards` block adds:
 * read it, route the open issues onto it, and plan the writes that put each routed issue there with
 * its target.
 *
 * **A person's answer at the table keeps an issue on the table.** An issue whose table row reads
 * `bet`, `not now` or `check` stays on the product board whatever the routing rule says, and so do
 * the members of a group whose head reads one, so a split never pulls decided work out from under
 * the table. Every other open issue the rule routes to on-call goes there and leaves the table:
 * the agenda does not propose it, and route takes its table row off once it has placed it.
 *
 * **The Response target cell is a projection, never a source.** The target an item waits against is
 * the one its labels pick now, and the wait runs from the issue's filing, so a relabel moves the
 * target and no run's timing moves the clock. Route rewrites the cell to match; flags never read it.
