/**
 * What `table prep` puts on the next table's agenda, as data. Pure, so "a second run adds nothing"
 * is a property of {@link planPrep} over rows already in step, not of a live run.
 *
 * Three steps, in order. {@link candidatesOf} sorts the open board into the agenda sections and
 * names the Customers reports that must be triaged first. {@link admit} takes the candidates one at
 * a time with the group each heads, and keeps a row count under the cap. {@link planPrep} then
 * decides every write against the rows as they read.
 *
 * The rules it holds:
 * - **A row is a real, open issue.** The only add is an issue by number, so no draft can be made;
 *   only open issues are candidates; and a `proposed` row whose issue closed is taken off the table.
 * - **A row and its open blockers are one chain row.** Its group comes from {@link groupOf}, so it
 *   counts once toward the cap, its members carry no Section and show only in the members view, and
 *   no candidate is left off because it has blockers. A candidate a chosen row already covers is
 *   not proposed again, and a chosen row a later chain covers moves inside that chain. A `bet` row
 *   is the exception: no group takes it as a member, so prep leaves its Section alone.
 * - **A person's answer stands.** A row already `bet`, `not now`, in a lane, shipped or up for its
 *   check is never re-proposed. The one exception is a running bet with a flag: it comes back to
 *   Tails with the flag's rec, its Stage and Size untouched.
 * - **A ruling is asked for as a pick.** A row whose issue waits on a person (`ready-for:human`)
 *   reads "needs your pick" with its options, never "yes".
 * - **A ruling nobody built comes back.** An open issue carrying a ruling ({@link RuledUnbuilt}) is
 *   a Tails candidate, oldest ruling first, until someone answers it at the table.
