/**
 * The on-call board a `boards` block adds: which issues it holds, the target each waits against, and
 * the project it lives in. Pure: routing reads an issue's attributes and nothing else, so which board
 * an issue lands on is a property of this module, not of a live run.
 *
 * **Every issue lands on exactly one board.** {@link boardOf} answers `on-call` when any one routing
 * attribute matches and `product` otherwise, so no issue is on neither and none is on both.
 *
 * **An on-call item carries a response target, never a size.** Work there is not bet on; it is pulled
 * in the order it arrives, and the target says how long it may wait before the table hears of it.
 *
