/**
 * The table's flags: what brings a row, or the table as a whole, back to the people who decide.
 *
 * Pure: it reads rows, their groups and their lane records, and names what needs a person. Nothing
 * here writes or reverts anything, because a flag is a question for the table and never an answer
 * to it. The one stop the rulings allow, a lane at {@link TableSettings.stopMultiple} times its
 * size, is read off the same {@link OverSize} flag, so the lane that stops and the row the table
 * sees flagged can never disagree.
 *
 * **A group row is judged once, on its sums.** Spent $ and Asks are summed over the head and every
 * member through {@link tallyOver}, the sum `table sync` writes, so a flag and the Spent $ column
 * name one number. A group is stuck only when its latest activity, across all of them, is old. A
 * member row is never flagged on its own.
 *
 * **A check that could not be read is `unread`, never clear.** A spend with an unmeasured lane, a
 * control-plane set that did not read, a roadmap that did not parse: each is named, so the reader
 * of the flags knows which question went unasked.
