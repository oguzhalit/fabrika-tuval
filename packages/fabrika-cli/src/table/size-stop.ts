/**
 * The one stop the rulings allow: a lane whose row has spent its stop multiple of its size stops
 * before its next shell. Everything short of that is a flag and the lane keeps going.
 *
 * It reads the rows the lane's issue reaches — its own, its epic's, the chains it blocks — through
 * the flags' own reader and asks {@link stopOf}, so a lane stops exactly when its row reads
 * `stopped` in `table flags`. A row short of its stop only on what was measured cannot be proven at
 * it, so the lane goes on and the brief names the unmeasured lanes.
 *
 * **No table is no stop.** A repository that never set a table up has no sizes to spend past, so it
 * is `Clear`. A table that could not be read is `Unknown`, never clear, once the repository adopted
 * one (`./adoption.ts`) — unless the read failed on a missing `project` scope, which is `Unchecked`
 * and names the fix. In a repository whose `.fabrika.jsonc` declares no `table` block, any read
 * failure is `Unchecked`: nothing says a table exists, and refusing would stop every lane of every
 * repo that never adopted one. Either way the lane goes on and the brief says the stop was never
 * checked, and why.
