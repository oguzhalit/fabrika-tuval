/**
 * `table sync` — fill the table's columns from the lane records on its issues.
 *
 * Everything is read before anything is written: the project and its rows, the issue graph out to
 * every group the run touches, every lane record on those issues, and whether the pull requests the
 * records name have merged. A record that does not read refuses the whole run, because a sum over it
 * is undecidable.
 *
 * The writes then run in two passes over one plan. Adds land first, the rows are re-read so each new
 * item has an id, and the values follow. **The last plan must be empty**: it is the read-back, and it
 * is also what makes a second run answer `unchanged`.
 *
 * Sync never creates or links a project. With no table found it refuses and names `table setup`.
