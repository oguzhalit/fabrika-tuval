/**
 * `table flags` — what the next table must look at, read-only.
 *
 * It reads the rows the way `table sync` does, then the three facts the table-wide flags need: the
 * control-plane set a `bet` is judged against, the active campaigns, and this week's spend by
 * issue. It writes nothing: a flag is a question for the table, and a `bet` set by someone outside
 * the control-plane set is left exactly as it was set.
 *
 * Naming issues narrows the run to the rows they reach, and then the table-wide checks are not asked,
 * because a campaign count and a share of the week's spend are facts about the whole table.
 *
 * The week the shares are judged over is the 7 days that end at the next table day — the week that
 * table looks back on — and which table it is counts the distinct Table day dates before it.
