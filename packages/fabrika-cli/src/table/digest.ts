/**
 * The digest: which open issues have waited past a response target, and the message that says so.
 *
 * Pure: it reads the open issues, the on-call board as read and the config, and writes nothing, so
 * what a scheduled run posts is a property of this module. `digest-post.ts` sends the message;
 * `digest-verb.ts` joins the two.
 *
 * **The on-call section is the `past-target` judgment.** It judges each open on-call item it is
 * handed through {@link pastTargetOf}, with the wait starting at the issue's filing or at the
 * board's making when that is later, so the channel and the table agree on any item both see.
 *
 * **One message, both tools.** The text is cut to {@link MESSAGE_LIMIT}, the tighter of the two
 * tools' documented limits, and the cut says how many lines it dropped.
