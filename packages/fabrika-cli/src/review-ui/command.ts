/**
 * The `review-ui` verb group — `fabrika review-ui <verb>`.
 *
 * The adapter and nothing else: it declares the flags (`--help` is the interface, so every flag
 * carries a one-line description), wires the two impure legs — the capture render and the verified
 * evidence upload — runs the pure verb, and emits its outcome. Every decision lives in the
 * `*-verb.ts` modules beside it.
 *
 * **Every leaf is declared with `leafCommand`, never a bare `Command.make`** — the bare form
 * silently opts out of the excess-operand guard.
