/**
 * `review-ui route` — the single sanctioned way to resolve the `review-ui` namespace on a PR that
 * renders nothing.
 *
 * `ship scope` raises the `ui` class off a path test, and a path test cannot see whether pixels
 * moved. So a PR whose only change under a declared `uiSurfaces` prefix is a docblock requires a
 * `review-ui` verdict that this group structurally cannot produce — `render` refuses zero surfaces,
 * `post` requires a capture set — and `ship gate` blocks on the absence forever. This verb records the
 * missing half instead of manufacturing the verdict: an attested, head-bound "nothing here
 * renders", which `ship gate` resolves as `routed`.
 *
 * **It is not a second verdict path, and three things keep it from becoming one.** The bytes are
 * their own wire format with no polarity, so a route can never be read as a PASS. The record is
 * head-bound with no content binding, so every branch push voids it and the next tree is attested
 * afresh. And `ship gate` admits a route for `review-ui` alone — no other namespace's evidence
 * requirement is reachable from here.
 *
 * The one mechanical precondition is that the PR actually raises the class: routing a namespace the
 * diff never derived resolves nothing and leaves a record claiming a question nobody asked. That case
 * is a clean end, not a refusal, so it answers `none` on exit 0 and writes nothing — a caller tells it
 * from an absent or closed PR by the exit code alone, without parsing a sentence.
 * Deriving it re-uses `review/classes.ts`'s own `isUiSurface`, over the same declared `uiSurfaces`
 * prefixes the gate raised the class from, rather than a second predicate — the `none` answer must
 * bind the exact rule that raised the class, or the two drift and this verb answers `none` on a PR
 * the gate is meanwhile blocking, sending the reviewer to ROUTED-ELSEWHERE while `ship gate` still
 * owes the namespace.
 *
 * The file set that runs over is the `pulls/<n>/files` enumeration read through
 * {@link platformFileSet}, so the `changed_files` the pull-request record declares is reported as a
 * disagreement line and never refused on — that count is computed against a base cached at the last
 * push, and refusing on it stranded the lane with no act available to clear it. Two shapes still
 * refuse, because neither leaves a ui count anybody read: an **empty** list, and one at the
 * endpoint's own file ceiling, which can only ever shrink that count.
 *
 * Whether the diff renders anything is the *skill's* judgment over `review diff`'s refusal-guarded
 * bytes, and it stays there. No verb decides it: that was a rejected candidate, because a
 * second path heuristic is the first one's defect relocated.
 *
 * **Where the route rests on a hand-verification instead of a render, this verb also judges whether
 * that evidence is still current.** `--verified-at` names the head the hand-verification ran at, and
 * the evidence stands exactly when no file in the range to `--sha` raises the `ui` class — the same `isUiSurface` over the same prefixes, never a second predicate.
 * Two shapes leave that range unread rather than clear: a comparison at GitHub's file ceiling, and
 * one whose two heads have diverged, where the platform answers from their merge base instead. Both
 * are UNKNOWN.
 * Left off, the range is never read and the route behaves as it always did: a prose-only diff under
 * a declared prefix rests on the body alone and has no head to compare against.
 *
 * **The record also rests on the text gate's verdict, so this verb reads that too.** The `review-code`
 * verdict in force at `--sha` is a precondition: a standing FAIL refuses the route outright, and a
 * route resting on a hand-verification refuses when no text verdict binds that head at all, because
 * the clause the interim exception prescribes asserts the conjunction. A prose-only route asserts
 * nothing about the text lane, so an absent verdict there is stated on stderr rather than refused.
 * The reader is `review verdicts`'s and the ordering `ship gate`'s — see `./text-verdict.ts`.
 *
 * **A PR with no preview routes only as far as the repo's `reviewUi.whenNoPreview` rules allow.**
 * `--no-preview` resolves the mode over the PR's ui files (`./no-preview.ts`): `require-render`
 * refuses, `skip` posts a record flagged `basis:skip`, and `hand-check` posts one flagged
 * `basis:hand-check` only over an owner account's comment that names this head and carries screenshots
 * (`./hand-check.ts`). A hand-check stands in for the render exactly as a desk run does, so it rests
 * on a standing text PASS too. Both flags ride the record's first line, so `ship gate` and the
 * lane's proof say the namespace was not rendered. The verb does not take `--no-preview` on the
 * caller's word: it reads the PR's preview announcement through `render`'s own resolver and routes
 * only where `render` would refuse for want of one.
