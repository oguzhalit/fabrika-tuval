/**
 * The `review-ui` namespace against the registered `verdict-marker` wire format.
 *
 * The implementation ticket flagged "one registry-side enum addition" as owed. It is not: the
 * format gates the namespace with a **pattern**, `^(review|check-epic-plan|governance)(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, not a
 * closed vocabulary, and `review-ui` already satisfies it. This test is that finding held in place —
 * a future narrowing of the pattern reds here rather than silently making this group's every
 * verdict unreadable.
