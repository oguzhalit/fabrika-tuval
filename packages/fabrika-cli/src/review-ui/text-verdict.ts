/**
 * The standing `review-code` verdict a `routed-elsewhere` record rests on.
 *
 * The interim exception that lets a hand-verification stand in for a render prescribes a clause
 * asserting a text review PASS beside it, and `review-ui route` asserted that conjunction while
 * reading neither half. The ruling below settles it: the text PASS is a precondition of the route,
 * not commentary on it, so the verb reads it here.
 *
 * **The reader is `review verdicts`'s, never a second one.** A claim is the `verdict-marker` first
 * line or the §CP advisory carrier, exactly the two carriers that sweep resolves; the in-force
 * ordering is `ship gate`'s own {@link inForce}, currency is {@link bindToContent}'s, and the
 * advisory's polarity is {@link advisoryPolarity}'s. Three copies of one rule is how a marker reads
 * current to one gate and stale to the next — the failure the hand-verification's own currency check
 * was mechanized to stop, and the polarity predicate reached it first: held in triplicate, a
 * `[FAIL]` row inside an advisory cleared this route while `ship gate` refused on the same comment.
 *
 * The advisory is admitted here whatever the lane's control-plane state, which is `lane prove`'s
 * rule rather than `ship gate`'s — that one reads the carrier only under `--cp`, gating on an
 * approval this verb does not judge. Reading it unconditionally can only make the route stricter,
 * since an advisory the §CP fence would have excluded is still a text claim about this head.
 *
 * What is **not** read here is the host's native review fold. `ship gate` folds an `APPROVED` or
 * `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review into `review-code` because it is the merge authority; this verb only
 * judges whether the record's own clause states something true, and the fold costs a second API
 * surface for a carrier the pipeline's text gate does not emit. A route's refusal line names
 * `review verdicts`, so a lane whose text verdict lives only in a native review sees which reader
 * answered.
