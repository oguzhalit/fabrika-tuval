/**
 * `review-ui post` — the single sanctioned `review-ui` verdict emit.
 *
 * Nine steps, each gating the next: re-resolve the live head, read the evidence set through its
 * manifest, re-validate every capture against that manifest, **verify-upload every capture before
 * anything posts**, compose through the wire format, leak-scan the assembled comment, upsert one
 * comment for this namespace under this carrier, read it back from live PR state, and **re-check
 * that every capture the posted comment embeds opens as the bytes that were judged**.
 *
 * Step 4 is this verb's reason to exist. The capture package's upload leg is `never`-typed by
 * contract — every transport failure degrades to `{hostedUrl: null, uploadError}` and no consumer
 * ever read `uploadError` — so a 100%-failed evidence channel decorated months of PASSes.
 * Here a failed upload or a failed verification is `17` and **nothing is posted**: the
 * judge-the-local-bytes rule still stands (the pixels you judged were local), but the *marker*
 * does not land over a broken evidence channel.
 *
 * There is no `--namespace`. This group emits `review-ui` and nothing else, so a
 * misdirected-namespace write is unrepresentable rather than refused.
 *
 * Step 7 **appends**: a matched comment keeps its prior verdict verbatim below
 * `../review/supersede.ts`'s fence and the fresh verdict takes the first line, because GitHub keeps
 * no comment-body history and a PATCH over a verdict is that verdict gone — a standing FAIL
 * became a PASS with nothing left showing a gate had ever blocked. A post that would retire
 * a standing verdict of the opposite polarity at the same head is `18` until `--supersede` says so.
 *
 * Step 9 **never withdraws** what step 7 wrote. When the posted evidence does not open, the verdict
 * stays, a plain note beside it says why it does not count, and the verb exits `9`. Not counting it
 * is the readers' job: `ship gate` and `lane prove` re-check the gallery's evidence before they
 * count a `review-ui` verdict (`./standing-evidence.ts`).
