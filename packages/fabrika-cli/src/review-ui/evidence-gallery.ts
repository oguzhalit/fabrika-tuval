/**
 * The evidence gallery a `review-ui` verdict carries: one hosted image per judged shot, each with
 * the sha256 of the bytes that were judged.
 *
 * `review-ui post` writes it and `ship gate` / `lane prove` read it back, so the digest is what lets
 * a gate hold a hosted capture to the judged bytes without the reviewer's local set. The digest
 * rides an HTML comment, so it renders as nothing and leaves the image markdown GitHub rewrites
 * untouched.
 *
 * Only the verdict in force is read: a re-post keeps prior verdicts, and their galleries, below
 * `../review/supersede.ts`'s fence, and none of those is the evidence the first line stands on.
