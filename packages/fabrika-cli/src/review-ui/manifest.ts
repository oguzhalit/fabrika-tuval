/**
 * The capture set: where its bytes live, what its manifest says, and how a later verb re-reads it.
 *
 * `review-ui render` writes the manifest and `review-ui post` reads it, so the two never trade a
 * carried variable — a set is whatever its `manifest.json` says it is, and a set without a readable
 * manifest is not a set. The manifest bytes are byte-identical to `render`'s stdout object for the
 * same reason: one document, two channels, so nothing can be true on one and not the other.
 *
 * The set path is **deterministic from the PR and the head**, never a `mktemp -d` nobody recorded
 * (v1 S4: a PASS whose evidence upload failed was unauditable). The `--out` set name is the run's
 * own key inside that directory — two concurrent reviews of one head name different sets and never
 * write each other's bytes — the key is the run, and a session is not a run.
