/**
 * Whether a PR comment is an owner account's hand-check the ui gate may stand on in place of a
 * render.
 *
 * Four facts, all read off the comment, and all required: it is on this PR, a control-plane account
 * wrote it, it names the PR's exact head, and it carries a screenshot. The head is what keeps the
 * evidence honest — a hand-check of an earlier tree says nothing about this one, and the record the
 * route posts is bound to this head alone.
 *
 * Two kinds of comment pass those facts and are not a person's: the builder's own `ui evidence`
 * comment, and any comment carrying an agent stamp. Where an agent posts under a roster account the
 * author fact cannot tell them from the owner, so each is refused on what its body says.
