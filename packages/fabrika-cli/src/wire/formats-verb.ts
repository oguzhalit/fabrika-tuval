 * `wire formats` — the registered formats, derived from `./registry.ts`.

 * The listing is a projection of the array, never a second copy of it, which is what makes "is this
 * format registered?" answerable from the binary that dispatches rather than from a document that
 * can drift. An empty registry refuses: printing an empty list would be a proven
 * negative from a verb that resolved nothing.
