/**
 * The PR body's `## Deviations` section — the one place its grammar is stated.
 *
 * The section had two contracts that disagreed: `build pr` asked only that the heading exist with
 * something under it, while the review reader dropped every bullet carrying no `Said` field and then
 * called a section of zero surviving entries `malformed`. A body that fully satisfied the producer
 * was therefore guaranteed to fail the consumer closed, and no author-facing doc stated the field
 * grammar either side was judging against. Registering the section as a wire format is what
 * makes that disagreement unrepresentable: one module owns the bytes, and both sides read it.
 *
 * `read` is total, and `Found` carries a {@link DeviationsDisclosure} rather than a bare list,
 * because this section has **four** meanings where the wire has three answers. `None.` is a checked
 * claim — an author who considered the question and has nothing to disclose — and folding it into
 * `Absent` is how "never considered it" comes to read as "nothing to disclose". So `None.` is a
 * `Found` of its own tag, and `Absent` stays reserved for a body with no such heading at all.
 *
 * An entry carries all four fields. The reader required `Said` alone and the class label is a
 * routing hint, but a disclosure missing *Why* or *Disposition* states what changed without stating
 * whether anyone accepted it — so the refusal now names the missing field at the point the body is
 * written, instead of costing a review round that could not say what was wrong.
 *
 * An older pipeline's deviations section supplied the semantics — the four fields, the seven
 * classes, the M/R/D tiers — and was read as prior art, never called.
