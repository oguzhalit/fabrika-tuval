/**
 * The wire-formats index doc, rendered from the registry and reconciled against it.
 *
 * The doc's per-format projection — owner module, producers, consumers — used to be typed by hand
 * off `./registry.ts`. That is a second source of truth: it agrees until someone lands a format and
 * forgets a line, and the page still reads as authoritative once it stops agreeing. So the
 * projection is not written by hand at all any more. It is one generated region, rendered here from
 * the rows, and `fabrika wire index --write` is its only writer — a hand edit inside the region is
 * overwritten by the generator and red under the check. What stays hand-written is the half the
 * registry cannot hold: the protocol narrative under each ``### `<key>` `` heading. Neither half
 * restates the other.
 *
 * Three divergences are findings rather than silent drift: a registered format with no narrative
 * section, a narrative section for no registered format, and a region whose bytes are not what the
 * registry renders today. Zero scope is a refusal, never a vacuous pass — an empty or
 * unreadable doc, a missing marker pair, a doc with no format sections, and an empty registry all
 * refuse, because each would otherwise let the reconciliation report agreement over nothing.
