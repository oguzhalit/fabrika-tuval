/**
 * What a wire format is, as a type — the shape every schema module fills and the registry lists.
 *
 * A wire format is the byte-level agreement two skills meet through on a GitHub artifact. Its
 * schema module owns the bytes and nothing else: composing them ({@link WireFormat.emit}) and
 * reading them back ({@link WireFormat.read}). Which deviation class a finding belongs to, when a
 * criterion is worth writing — those judgements stay in the skills.
 *
 * **`read` is total, and its three answers are the reason this type exists.** A reader whose
 * failure mode is "return the well-formed empty value" is indistinguishable, at the call site, from
 * one that genuinely found nothing — so a heading that drifted by one character reads back as "this
 * issue has no acceptance criteria" and a grader passes over nothing. {@link WireRead} admits no
 * such value: `Found` carries a {@link NonEmptyReadonlyArray} by construction, so "found, but
 * empty" is not a representable state, and every non-conforming input lands on `Absent` or
 * `Malformed` with a reason attached.
