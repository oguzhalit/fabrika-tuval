/**
 * The ruling marker — the comment a human on the control plane posts to record that an issue has
 * been ruled on, so every gate downstream grades the ruling rather than only the body it was written
 * against — the same marker mechanism `./plan-approval.ts` uses, over an issue rather than an epic.
 *
 *     decision-ruled: #8 @ a1b2c3d4e5f6 · ruling:https://github.com/o/r/issues/8#issuecomment-9 · 2026-08-20T05:11:02Z
 *     decision-ruled: #8 @ a1b2c3d4e5f6 · ruling:… · supersedes:3 · 2026-08-20T05:11:02Z
 *
 * **The subject is any issue, and the key's `decision-` is history rather than scope.** The format
 * was minted for `type:decision` issues, where the ruling flips the audience; it now also carries a
 * founder ruling landing on a `type:bug` or `type:feature` issue mid-lane, which is what
 * `review criteria` folds into the graded set. Widening the read rather than minting a sibling key
 * is deliberate: one walk, one author gate, one scan — and every marker already on the board keeps
 * reading. Renaming the key would strand those.
 *
 * **One mechanism, two surfaces.** The binding half is `./issue-marker.ts`, the same walk
 * `./plan-approval.ts` reads through — `#<n> @ <digest>`, the number carried in the bytes so a quoted
 * marker cannot travel onto another issue. What is this format's own is the tail: the digest binds
 * the **issue body that was ruled on** rather than a ledger scope, one field names the comment the
 * ruling is written in, and an optional field names the body criterion this ruling replaces.
 *
 * **`supersedes` is the only mechanical statement of contradiction there is.** No verb can read a
 * founder's prose and judge which acceptance criterion it overturns, and one that guessed would
 * silently drop a row a reviewer still owes. So the human recording the ruling says which row it
 * replaces, by its 1-based position in the body's block, and the graded set reports that row as
 * superseded rather than dropping it. A marker naming none contradicts nothing and adds a row.
 *
 * **The ruling field is why this marker is worth more than a label.** A builder that picks the issue
 * up reads the founder's own words at the URL the marker names, rather than inferring the choice from
 * a thread; it is the value `build claim --cites` takes, and a cited ruling is what makes a
 * decision buildable at all. The URL is checked against the issue the marker binds
 * here, in the read: a ruling recorded on some other issue rules nothing on this one, and admitting
 * one would let a single comment unlock every decision on the board.
 *
 * **The digest binds the issue body, and that is its honest limit.** It says the body has not been
 * rewritten under the ruling. It does not say the founder read any particular comment, and no marker
 * can. As with the plan approval, the marker is never proof on its own: what is honoured is these
 * bytes **plus** an author the control-plane roster resolved.
