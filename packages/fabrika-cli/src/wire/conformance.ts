/**
 * The conformance laws, applied to every registered format by iterating the registry.
 *
 * The totality law is worth exactly as much as the diligence of whoever lands the next format, and
 * per-format tests are diligence. So the laws live here, over `WireFormat` and nothing narrower —
 * this module never learns a format's name, never branches on one, and holds no skip list. A row is
 * checked because it is in the array, and the samples the laws are driven from ride on the row
 * itself (`WireFixtures`), which the type makes required: a row added without them does not compile,
 * so coverage cannot quietly shrink to the formats whose author remembered to write tests.
 *
 * The compile-time half of the same idea is `format.ts`'s `brandWitnesses`, which derives a row's
 * brand witnesses from its value type. The two halves are complementary: what a type can refuse it
 * refuses at build time, and what it cannot — that `read` answers `Malformed` rather than `Absent`
 * for a drift — the findings below refuse at test time.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no** law over `brands` here. There was one, checking the witnesses named
 * distinct non-blank fields, and `brandWitnesses` made both halves unfalsifiable: distinct, because
 * the witnesses are keys of one object literal (`TS1117`) mapped one-per-key; non-blank, because
 * `BrandedKeys` drops a blank or whitespace-only key, so such a witness cannot be written. A law
 * that cannot fail is the vacuous pass this module exists to forbid, so it went.
 *
 * Zero scope is a refusal, not a pass: a suite that iterated an empty registry would run
 * no assertions and report green, which is the vacuous pass the law exists to forbid.
