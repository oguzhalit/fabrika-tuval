/**
 * The `## Came from` section — the one line saying which issue an artifact's question arrived from,
 * and the only thing carrying a wayfinding frontier ticket number into a sibling skill.
 *
 *     ## Came from
 *
 *     #6
 *
 * Both siblings `map fork` routes to write it: `spike open` records it on the spike issue and
 * `grill open` records it on the session issue, where it is also the resume key. Two writers and
 * two readers across two skills is a wire format, so it is owned here rather than by either group.
 *
 * **`standalone` is a value, not an absence.** An artifact opened with no ticket writes the literal
 * word, so "nobody bound this" is something the section says rather than something a reader infers
 * from a blank.
 *
 * **The section is provenance, never instruction.** A number here says where the question came
 * from; it grants nothing, and no verb reads the named issue for direction.
 *
 * The reason `read` is total matters more here than almost anywhere else in the group. This
 * section's `Found` decides whether a session already exists for a ticket, so a drifted heading
 * answered as "bound to nothing" would resume nothing and mint a **second** session on one ticket —
 * a silent split, where the failure it replaced was at least a visibly duplicate topic.
 * `Malformed` is what makes the caller refuse instead of resume.
