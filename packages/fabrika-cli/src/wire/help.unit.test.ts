/**
 * `--help` is the interface (`claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/cli-interface-convention.md` §1), so what
 * it must state is asserted rather than trusted: what the verb answers, the shape of its stdout,
 * the codes it can exit on, and one literal invocation a caller can paste.
 *
 * It reads the description and the declared flags off the `Command`'s runtime shape, the same
 * deliberately-confined idiom `../excess-operand.unit.test.ts` uses — a plain widening assignment,
 * never a cast, so a rename upstream reds here at build time rather than leaving the assertions
 * silently vacuous.
