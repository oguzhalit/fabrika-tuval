/**
 * The verdict marker — the recognizable first line of a gate's verdict comment on a PR.
 *
 *     review-code: PASS @ 03135b91 content:2f1a9c4e0b7d — merge-ready
 *
 * Five fields: the gate **namespace**, the **polarity**, the **head SHA the reviewer inspected**, an
 * optional **content digest** of what it inspected, and the trailing human clause. A verdict attests
 * the exact tree it was formed over, so a marker carrying no SHA at all is malformed, not passing:
 * {@link read} never yields a `Found` with an empty SHA (the type forbids it — {@link HeadSha} has
 * no empty inhabitant), and the staleness question is its own answer rather than a fold into the
 * read.
 *
 * **What makes a verdict survive a head move is the content field, and its absence never does.**
 * The SHA alone was doing two jobs — invalidating on any branch push, and invalidating on base
 * drift — and it was over-broad on the first: an update-from-main that leaves both the diff and
 * every touched file byte-identical re-reviewed content nobody changed. So a marker that carries a
 * content digest binds to that digest instead, and {@link bindToContent} is where that comparison
 * lives. A marker with **no** content field falls back to head equality, which is strictly the
 * stricter of the two, so a legacy or hand-written marker can never gain survival it did not earn.
 *
 * `read` is total and its three answers are the design (see `./format.ts`). The discrimination that
 * carries the weight is **Absent vs Malformed**: bytes carrying no marker of this format at all are
 * `Absent`; bytes carrying something recognisably *reaching* for one — the namespace is there but
 * the polarity is unknown, the SHA is missing or not hex, the clause is gone — are `Malformed`. A
 * gate whose marker drifted must never read as a PR nobody reviewed.
 *
 * An older pipeline's gate-verdict contract and its matcher are where the semantics and the scars
 * come from — read as prior art, never called. Their upsert keying, advisory line and read-back
 * guard are deliberately not carried here.

/**
 * Whether a verdict claim still binds once the head has moved — decided on the content digest when
 * the marker carries one, and on head equality when it does not.
 *
 * It takes the two bound fields rather than a whole marker so the advisory carrier and the native
 * review fold, which are verdict claims carrying no marker, resolve through this one derivation
 * instead of a second one that could drift from it. A {@link VerdictMarker} satisfies the shape.
 *
 * Same three arms as {@link bindToHead}, and the non-folding is what carries the guarantee: a
 * caller that could not compute the head's digest gets `Unbindable`, never `Current` and never
 * `Stale`, because a comparison that could not be made is not a result in either direction. Every
 * consumer must block on `Unbindable` as it blocks on `Stale`; what it must never do is read one as
 * the other in the permissive direction.
 *
 * Four gates, in the order that makes each later one unreachable when an earlier one already
 * decided:
 *
 * 1. An unresolvable head is `Unbindable` — nothing below can be asked.
 * 2. The head the marker names is still the head ⇒ `Current` via `head`, and no digest is needed.
 *    This is the answer that predates the content field, untouched, and it is why the common path
 *    costs no git read.
 * 3. A marker carrying **no** content field is `Stale`, exactly as it was before the content field
 *    existed. Absence of a binding is never a binding; a legacy marker earns nothing by predating
 *    the field.
 * 4. `digest === null` — the caller holds a content-bound marker but could not compute the head's
 *    own digest — is `Unbindable`. Reading it as `Current` would let an unverifiable claim ship;
 *    reading it as `Stale` would be safe but would lie about *why*, and the reason is what tells an
 *    operator whether to fix a checkout or re-review.
