/**
 * The answer marker — the first line of the comment `grill answer` posts against a `fact` question.
 *
 *     grill-answered: R2.1 @ a1b2c3d4e5f6 · 2026-08-09T18:36:48Z
 *
 * These bytes are the **agent's own record and never a ruling**. The separation is carried in the
 * artifact rather than in a convention a later reader has to know, because a comment claiming a
 * founder decision is byte-indistinguishable from one carrying it when both share a format. A
 * reader that resolves `ruled` looks for `grill-ruled` and finds nothing here.
 *
 * Its digest is **informational**: it records which text was answered, so a reader can see the
 * question moved, and it never changes the state. A re-worded `fact` therefore stays `answered` —
 * `stale` exists to protect a *ruling* from drifting out from under the founder, and a fact has no
 * founder to protect.
 *
 * The vocabulary and the total read live in `./grill-marker.ts`; this module binds them to a key.
