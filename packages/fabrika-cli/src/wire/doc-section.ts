/**
 * One markdown section by heading — the lookup a shell runs instead of reading a whole contract.
 *
 * The section is the body under the matching ATX heading, from the line after it to the next
 * heading of equal or shallower depth (deeper subheadings stay inside). A heading inside a fenced
 * code block is not a heading — the hot contracts quote their own grammar in fences, and a match
 * there would hand a caller an example instead of the contract. The two refusals are proven facts,
 * kept apart because they demand different fixes: `Absent` (nothing to print) and `Duplicated`
 * (two sections with one name have no single meaning, so printing either would be a guess).
 *
 * Fences follow CommonMark: an opener of three-or-more backticks or tildes closes only on a marker
 * of the same character at least as long, so a ```` ``` ```` nested inside a ```` ```` ```` example
 * does not end the outer fence.
