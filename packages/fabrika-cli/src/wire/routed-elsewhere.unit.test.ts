/**
 * The one law the registry's conformance suite cannot state for this format: **a verdict and a
 * route never read as each other.**
 *
 * Conformance drives each row's reader over that row's own fixtures, so it proves this format is
 * total over its own bytes and says nothing about `verdict-marker`'s. The property that matters
 * here is cross-format: `ship gate` resolves a namespace by asking both readers, and the moment one
 * of them answers on the other's bytes, "I judged nothing" and "I judged it and it passed" become
 * one state.
