/**
 * The plan-approval marker — the comment a human on the control plane posts to approve one epic's
 * plan.
 *
 *     plan-approved: #7 @ 4d90e1bb27ac · 2026-08-16T07:16:03Z
 *
 * Three fields, and the digest is the load-bearing one: the approval binds the **ledger scope** the
 * plan gate judges, so a plan rewritten after the founder read it no longer matches and does not
 * inherit the approval.
 *
 * The binding half — `#<epic> @ <digest>`, and the discipline of carrying the number in the bytes —
 * lives in `./issue-marker.ts`, which `./decision-ruling.ts` reads through too. What is written here
 * is only what is this format's own: the key, and a tail that is one timestamp.
 *
 * **The digest binds the ledger scope, not the plan's prose.** Stated here so no reader over-reads
 * the marker: what `../plan/digest.ts` serializes is the
 * epic's stories, the topology, and each child's labels, criteria count, stories and containment.
 * The plan summary is outside it.
 *
 * The marker is never proof on its own. What the gate honours is this marker **plus** an author the
 * `@<org>/<team>` roster resolved at write time carried — the same discipline `./cap-clearance.ts`
 * holds for a cleared round, and the reason an agent-authored marker approves nothing.
