 * The cap-clearance marker — the comment `build clear` posts on a PR after its authorization.

 *     cap-cleared: round 3 · 2026-08-18T07:16:03Z
 *
 * Two fields, and the round is the load-bearing one: a clearance is spent by the round it names, so
 * it survives the push it exists to permit and expires the moment another FAIL round lands (see
 * `../cap-clearance.ts`). It carries no head SHA on purpose — a verdict attests a tree, but a
 * clearance authorizes the *next* tree, so binding one to a head would void it on first use.
 *
 * The marker is never proof on its own. What `build verdicts` folds as budget is this marker
 * **plus** an author in the repo's control-plane set plus the dated authorization comment
 * beside it, exactly as `grill-ruled` means the four clauses `grill read` applies and not the bytes.
