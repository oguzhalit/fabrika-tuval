/**
 * The lane-brief's repo-independence: the rules name no repo's path, and `read(emit(b))`
 * round-trips whatever entrypoint the driver resolved — in-tree source or an installed copy —
 * because the rules stay a pure function of the ground.
 *
 * Plus the closed field set: the section set alone leaves the driver's own instruction
 * representable, as a field rather than as a heading.
