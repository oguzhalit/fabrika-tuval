/**
 * The wire-format registry — the extension seam.
 *
 * One row per format: its `--format` key, its purpose, who writes the bytes, who reads them, and
 * the schema module that owns them. `fabrika wire formats` derives its listing from this array, and
 * `emit` / `read` / `check` resolve `--format` against it, so a format exists by being registered
 * here and nowhere else. That is the same discipline `../registry.ts` holds for verb groups, for
 * the same reason: a hand-maintained parallel list is a second source of truth that drifts, and the
 * drift is silent.
 *
 * A new format lands as a sibling schema module plus one row here — never as a branch inside a
 * verb.
 *
 * The index doc's per-format table is rendered from these rows too (`./index-doc.ts`), so the page
 * projects the registry instead of restating it by hand.
 *
 * A row also carries what `./conformance.ts` judges it by: the fixtures its laws are driven from and
 * the brands its value is built from. Both are required by {@link WireFormat}, so a format cannot be
 * registered without them — which is what makes the totality law inherited rather than re-written.
