/**
 * The `build-deviations` marker comment — an epic child's deviation disclosure, on its own issue.
 *
 *     build-deviations: #3
 *
 *     ## Deviations
 *
 *     None.
 *
 * A child of an epic run opens no PR, so the one disclosure surface `build` has — the PR body's
 * `## Deviations` section — does not exist for it. The disclosure lands as a marker comment on the
 * child issue instead, and the epic-tail review reads it from there.
 *
 * Two parts, each with one owner. The first non-blank line is the marker: `build-deviations:` plus
 * the issue the comment discloses for, so a comment pasted onto the wrong issue is visible as a
 * mismatch rather than silently counted. Everything under it is the `## Deviations` section exactly
 * as a PR body carries it, delegated wholesale to `./deviations.ts` — this module never re-states
 * the entry grammar, because two readers of the four-field bullet is the disagreement that format
 * exists to remove.
 *
 * **One marker per issue.** A repair round re-discloses, and a second comment is not a second
 * disclosure: `./deviations.ts` refuses two conforming headings as undecidable, so a stacked marker
 * makes the disclosure unreadable through the very verb the tail review is told to read it with.
 * Nothing here can enforce that — this module judges one artifact's bytes and cannot see a comment
 * timeline — so the rule is held at the write seam by `build deviations`
 * (`../build/deviations-verb.ts`), which edits the standing marker in place. That verb is the only
 * sanctioned producer; a hand-rolled `gh issue comment` appends.
 *
 * The discrimination that carries the weight is **Absent vs Malformed**: bytes with no
 * `build-deviations:` first line are `Absent` — an ordinary comment, not a defective disclosure —
 * while a marker line over a missing or drifted section is `Malformed`, because the marker promised
 * a disclosure and the promise is what a tail reviewer would otherwise count as "nothing to read".
