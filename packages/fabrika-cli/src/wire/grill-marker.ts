/**
 * The field vocabulary the three `grill` markers are built from, and the total reader they share.
 *
 * `grill-ruled`, `grill-answered` and `grill-superseded` are three formats rather than one
 * discriminated by a field, because they carry different authority and a reader must never have to
 * parse a field to learn which. What they *do* share is the vocabulary — a question id, a round
 * digest, a timestamp — and the reading discipline: the marker is the artifact's first non-blank
 * line, a body carrying no such key is `Absent`, and a body reaching for the key and missing is
 * `Malformed`. Both live here so the three schema modules state them once between them.
 *
 * **A malformed marker is never silently `Absent`.** A real ruling written in the wrong shape must
 * be a *visible* state — `grill read` reports it as a `disregarded` row — and the discrimination
 * that makes that possible is the prefix gate below, which fires before any field is parsed.
 *
 * The brands are the other half. A `Found` cannot carry an empty digest or an id that is not
 * `R<round>.<n>`, because those types have no such inhabitant — the same device
 * `./verdict-marker.ts` uses to keep an unbound verdict unrepresentable rather than merely unlikely.
