/**
 * The lane-brief — the bytes a lane driver hands one freshly-spawned fabrika shell.
 *
 * Three fixed sections and nothing else: `## Task` (which lane, which lanes root, which fabrika
 * entrypoint, which task, which state, which shell), `## Ground` (links and refs, never prose), and
 * `## Rules` (byte-fixed text this module owns).
 *
 * **`## Task` carries the two local paths, because both address something the shell cannot derive
 * from its own worktree.** The lanes root is the driver's ledger: the default is relative and every
 * shell runs in its own worktree, so a shell told only the lane id records its terminal into its
 * worktree's `.fabrika/` and the driven lane never hears it. The `fabrika` entrypoint is the
 * copy of this CLI the shell must execute, resolved by the driver against the repo it is actually
 * standing in — rules that named one repo's own `packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts` as a literal
 * produce a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on the shell's first verb, and on every verb after it, in any repo
 * that installs fabrika as a dependency. Both ride inside the format rather than as a line the
 * driver appends under the bytes: an appended line is text the reader below calls malformed, which
 * would turn the byte-fixed guarantee into a budget.
 *
 * **The rules are the format's own bytes, not a driver's phrasing.** A prompt composed per dispatch
 * is a prompt two drivers write differently, and the rule that matters most — carry URLs, never a
 * restatement — is then enforced by nothing but the driver's care. Fixing the bytes here makes the
 * drift unrepresentable rather than detectable. That is also why the entrypoint is a `## Task`
 * field and not an interpolation into the rules: the reader recomputes the rules from the ground
 * alone, so a machine-resolved path inside them would make every brief malformed on the next
 * machine that read it.
 *
 * **`## Ground` carries URLs, git refs and no content.** A brief that summarised an issue would hand
 * the shell a stale contract to work from, and the shell has verbs that read the live one.
 *
 * Ground comes in five shapes because an epic run has one branch and one PR: a child's
 * states have no PR at all — they build in a worktree, and their review judges a commit range the
 * driver's tree resolved — the epic's tail has that one PR plus the epic issue whose children's
 * disclosures its review reads, its repair round has both of those plus the assembly branch the PR's
 * head is, and every other state has one PR to read. {@link LaneGround} is that union, so a brief
 * carrying an epic branch under a state that may not stand on one is not a value anyone can
 * construct.

ends on \`BUILT-NO-PR\`, whose branch disposition is exactly that: left local and unpushed for this
lane to fold.
A child re-entering \`build\` after a \`FAIL\` is a repair, not a second build: \`build claim\` refuses
the fresh claim naming that FAIL, and the route it points at takes over the branch the prior lane
built on rather than cutting another. A \`FAIL\` out of \`integrate\` writes no verdict on the child, so
pass this brief's \`lane\` and \`root\` to \`build claim\` and \`build resume-child\` as
\`--lane <lane> --lane-root <root>\`: the claim reads that \`FAIL\`, its exit and the assembly head off
the lane's ledger, and without them it reads the child as finished.
A child's build discloses its deviations — the section a PR body would carry — as a
\`build-deviations\` marker comment on the child issue, posted through
\`node <fabrika> build deviations <child> --token <claim-token>\` with the
\`## Deviations\` section on stdin; the epic-tail review reads them from there.
That verb is the only sanctioned way this marker is posted: it edits the standing
marker in place, so a repair round re-discloses without stacking a second comment the
reader would refuse as undecidable.
