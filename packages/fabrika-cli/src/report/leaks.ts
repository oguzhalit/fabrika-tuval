/**
 * The body-surface leak predicate, shared by every verb that posts authored text to a public
 * artifact.
 *
 * A machine-local path, an email address or a name the repo keeps private, in a body posted to a
 * public issue, is a leak, and no merge gate covers it — the repo's committed-file leak gate decides
 * whether a *file in a diff* carries one, and a runtime issue body is never in a diff. This is the
 * ungated surface, not a second verdict on a gated one.
 *
 * **Four structural shapes, and names only from the adopter's own config.** The three path roots and
 * the email shape are structural, so a new operator, a renamed tool directory or a different machine
 * needs no edit here. The only names this predicate refuses are the ones a repo declares under
 * `leakNames` ([`config/keys/leak-names.ts`](../config/keys/leak-names.ts)); a caller that passes
 * none gets the structural shapes alone.
