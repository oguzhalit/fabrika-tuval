 * Reporting either as `none` is the degenerate-silence trap this token exists to close.
 *
 * **Two token lists, not one.** {@link tokenize} produces the ranking list, capped at
 * {@link MAX_TOKENS}; {@link searchTokens} narrows it to the {@link SEARCH_TOKENS} prefix the
 * AND-joined search query gets. The floor above is evaluated against the ranking list, so narrowing
 * for search never pushes a usable query into `indeterminate`.
