/**
 * `report scratch` — the staging path a reporter writes a body into before redirecting it on stdin.
 *
 * `<temp root>/fabrika-report/<allocation-id>/<slug>`. The group's writing verbs read their body on
 * stdin, and a heredoc puts that body inside the command string the worktree-isolation verifier
 * grades as one unit — the staged route in
 * `claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/skill-conventions.md` §4 takes it back out, and it needs an
 * allocating verb to print the path it redirects from.
 *
 * **The key is a fresh id per call, because a reporter holds no claim and no lane.** `build scratch`
 * and `triage scratch` key on a claim nonce; a report is filed mid-task by whatever agent saw the
 * thing, so there is no nonce to key on and a session id alone is the shared-namespace clobber those
 * two verbs exist to prevent. A fresh id makes a collision unconstructible instead, at the cost that
 * the path is not re-derivable — which is why every caller is told to use the literal path this
 * verb printed rather than to rebuild it.
 *
 * The printed path is machine-local and must never reach a posted artifact: `report file`,
 * `report note` and `report amend` red on it (`5`).
