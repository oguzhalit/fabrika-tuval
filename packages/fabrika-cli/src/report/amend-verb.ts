/**
 * `report amend` — append a dated section to an existing issue's body over the guarded path.
 *
 * **This verb exists because there was no public one, and the hand-rolled call that filled the gap
 * posts a path.** `gh api -X PATCH -f body=@file` takes its value as a raw string, so the literal
 * `@/path/to/file` lands as the whole body and the write returns success. The plumbing was already
 * here; what was missing was a reachable seat for it, since
 * `triage enrich` is stage-scoped and cannot serve an append to an already-triaged issue.
 *
 * The scan reads the appended section only. Redacting the prior body would make an append a rewrite
 * of text this verb never authored, which is the one thing it must never do.
