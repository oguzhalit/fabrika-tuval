/**
 * The `report` verb group — `fabrika report <dedup|file|note|amend|scratch>`.
 *
 * The adapter and nothing else: it declares the flags (`--help` is the interface, so every flag
 * carries a one-line description), runs the pure verb, and emits its outcome. Every decision lives
 * in the `*-verb.ts` modules beside it, which is what makes each refusal testable without spawning
 * a process.
 *
 * **The body is a value, never a path.** There is deliberately no `--body` flag, no `--body-file`
 * and no temp file: a flag that accepts a path turns the body into a string the verb could post
 * verbatim, and a posting call that does not expand `@` then ships the literal path into a public
 * artifact. A shell redirect is fine and expected — the
 * *shell* reads the file, so what reaches the verb is already the bytes. `scratch` allocates the
 * file that redirect reads and adds no argument to any writing verb, which is why it is the staged
 * route's allocator rather than a body flag.
