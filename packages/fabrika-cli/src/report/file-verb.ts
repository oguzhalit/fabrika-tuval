/**
 * `report file` — compose the intake issue, guard it, create it, and read back what landed.
 *
 * **One transaction.** Every step is a precondition or a postcondition of *this observation is now
 * an issue in the intake queue*, and splitting them would hand a caller the chance to skip one.
 *
 * The check order is local-first: everything decidable from the bytes on stdin runs before any
 * network read, so a refusable body costs no API call and a refusal always names the cheapest
 * correctable thing first.
