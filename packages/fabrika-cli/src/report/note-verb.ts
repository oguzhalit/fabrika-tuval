/**
 * `report note` — add a note to an existing issue over the same guarded path.
 *
 * **This verb exists because the skill tells its caller to comment on a duplicate rather than file
 * a twin.** A skill that says that without providing a guarded path sends the caller to a
 * hand-rolled posting call — which is the exact call that has shipped a literal path as a body and
 * a comment whose landed text nobody read back, both of them comment posts rather than issue
 * creates.
