/**
 * Read a committed golden real-payload fixture verbatim.
 *
 * A hook handler's contract is defined by the runtime and only observable at execution, so its test
 * asserts against a *captured* payload committed as a fixture — never a hand-authored shape. The
 * bytes this returns are the same bytes fed to the handler's stdin, so the fixture, not inline test
 * code, is the assertion path's input.
 *
 * Reimplemented rather than reused: v1's CLI has the same helper, and calling into v1 is banned —
 * the scar is duplicated as behaviour, not as a dependency.
 *
 * The raw `node:fs`/`node:url` is deliberate: this is test-only scaffolding whose whole point is the
 * real committed file on disk, and `fileURLToPath` has no `Path` equivalent — both sit on
 * `.patterns/effect-platform-access.md`'s bright line.
