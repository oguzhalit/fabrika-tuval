/**
 * A lane's record — what the lane did, derived from its log and facts, ready to post.
 *
 * Nothing here is stored: builds, reviews, parks and asks are all read off a step-by-step replay
 * of `events.jsonl`, so the record cannot disagree with the ledger it summarises. The replay folds
 * each prefix of the log, which is what gives every event the leaf it left and the leaf it landed
 * in — the log itself records neither.
 *
 * An **ask** is a park whose route is `founder`: a lane that stopped on something only a person
 * could answer. The route is `report.ts`'s cause table, so a park nothing named routes to the
 * founder, the same fail-closed reading `recipe unpark` takes.
