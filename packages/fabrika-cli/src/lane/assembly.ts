/**
 * Where an epic run assembles, and the read that proves it is not the driver's own checkout.
 *
 * The assembly branch used to be cut with `git switch --create` in whatever tree invoked `operate`,
 * which in practice is a human's working tree: it then sat on `epic/<n>` for the whole run, tools
 * that read files there read the epic branch instead of the default one, and a second epic had no
 * checkout left to integrate in. So the branch gets a worktree of its own, one per run, and
 * every git write the assembly seat performs is proven to happen outside the main working tree
 * before it runs.
 *
 * The proof is git's own `--git-dir` / `--git-common-dir` pair, read in the tree the verb is
 * standing in: they are the same path in the main working tree and differ in every linked one. A
 * path comparison against `git worktree list` cannot serve here — the two sources disagree on
 * symlinked prefixes (`/var` vs `/private/var` on macOS), and a guard that refuses the legal path is
 * worse than none.
