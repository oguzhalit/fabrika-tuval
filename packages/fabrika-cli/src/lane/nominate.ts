/**
 * The one place a lane verb asks "which PR is this issue's".
 *
 * Two nomination reads, unioned, because neither alone answers the question. The closing-issue edge
 * (`pullsClosing`) is authoritative and lag-free but blind to `Part of #N`, the shape
 * `build --partial` emits and the shape a builder writes when it honestly declines to close its
 * issue; the search index sees any body but lags a fresh PR. Reading the edge first means a lagging
 * index can only fail to add a candidate, never hide the closing one.
 *
 * Both reads only nominate; the body's links decide, through `issueRefsOf` and the set membership
 * `tracePulls` applies. A candidate outside the caller's `PullScope`, or one that only
 * mentions the number in prose, drops out there rather than counting — so unioning in the looser read
 * widens candidates without widening what counts.
 *
 * `issueRefsOf` answers with a *kind* beside the numbers, and this module carries it rather than
 * dropping it: a merged PR that closed its issue and one that carried `Part of #N` are the same
 * merge to every reader that keeps only the numbers, which is how a partial ship folded its lane to
 * a terminal over an issue still open and still buildable. `traceClosure` in `./prove.ts`
 * is the one reader of that field, and every *nominated* fact carries it from here so the question
 * keeps one nominator. One other path feeds that reader, and it nominates nothing: `./closure.ts`
 * builds the field off the single PR a recorded ship line names, because a merged `Part of #N` is
 * invisible to both reads above and that is the case the read exists for.
 *
 * The numbers ride in two sets, and the difference only shows on a body carrying both kinds — an
 * epic tail's. `referencedIssues` is every number either kind names and is what `tracePulls` traces;
 * `linkedIssues` is the winning kind's alone and is what the closure reads test against `linkKind`.
 * One set for both questions is what left a finished epic run with no PR the nominator could find.
 *
 * **Why it is shared rather than copied.** `lane prove` unioned both reads while `lane brief` read
 * the edge alone, so a `Part of #N` PR proved a `DONE`, folded the lane to `review`, and then had no
 * reviewer dispatchable against it — a park no event could clear, because the divergence was a
 * property of the artifact and restoring the state restored the wall. Two verbs answering
 * one question have to answer it from one nominator.
