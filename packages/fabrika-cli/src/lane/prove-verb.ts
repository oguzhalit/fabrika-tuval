/**
 * `lane prove` — read the artifact a lane event claims, before the event is recorded.
 *
 * "Artifacts over self-reports" was the retired epic conductor's standing rule, enforced by reading
 * the git graph. This is the lane machine's counterpart, and which artifact it reads is the task's
 * own shape: a single-issue lane and an epic run's tail are contradicted by an open PR tracing to
 * the task's issue and the verdicts on it (that ordering is the board's, never the local
 * ledger's); an epic run's child opens no PR at all, so its `DONE` is contradicted by the
 * commits its branch adds over the epic branch, read off this tree, and its `PASS` by a range-bound
 * verdict on the child issue that still binds the content it judged.
 *
 * A reviewer's park out of a review cell is read here too, and it is the one claim that runs the
 * other way: it asserts the run reached no verdict, so a still-binding `FAIL` refuses it and every
 * unreadable half lets it through (`proveParkUncontradicted`).
 *
 * **It writes nothing**, and it is not optional. Both appending verbs run this read themselves and
 * refuse on its codes with the log byte-identical — `lane report` for a shell recording its own
 * terminal token, `lane transition` for the driver's own records. It stays a verb of its own so a
 * caller can ask what the proof says without recording anything.
 *
 * Every refusal names what it looked for, and the failing readings stay on their own codes because
 * their remedies are opposite: nothing there, not finished yet, says the other thing, several
 * candidates. The four are the artifact-independent vocabulary, so the range arms allocate no new
 * seat — what a caller must do about "the artifact is not there" does not change with its kind.
 *
 * **At exit 0 there are three answers, and a driver routes on which one came back.** `proven` says
 * the artifact is there. `not-required` says the machine walks this event out of this leaf and the
 * event claims nothing a read could falsify — record it. `not-walkable` says the machine would not
 * walk it at all: an event name no state of this lane's machine holds a cell for (the ledger's own
 * namespaced `ISSUE.PASS` is the one a driver reaches for) or a recognised event this leaf owes no
 * cell (a `PASS` out of a `blocked` park, which walks `UNBLOCKED` alone). The third used to answer
 * `not-required` too, so a driver who ran the read before the `UNBLOCKED` that reopens the lane got
 * a green that had checked nothing — and the two readings shared one exit code, with the difference
 * living only in a stdout field. The walk question is the machine's own ({@link walkOf}), so a lane
 * whose workflow renames its events or its states answers it off itself.
 *
 * Both verdict arms answer with the namespaces they subtracted from this cell's bar
 * ({@link ProofOutcome}), because the caller records that on the event line: which cell still owes
 * the rendered verdict is not re-derivable from a bare `PASS`.
 *
 * The outcome also names which of the three answers it gave ({@link ProofLabel}), because an exit of
 * `0` here is two different facts: `proven` is the artifact saying so, and `not-required` is nothing
 * having been claimed. A caller that may act only on the first — `lane recover`, which records the
 * event a killed shell owed — would otherwise have to re-parse this verb's own stdout to tell them
 * apart, so the label is derived here, once, in the module that writes those bytes.

/**
 * The ship stage's closure read: did the merge behind this `DONE` discharge the issue, or land part
 * of it?
 *
 * It is not a proof and cannot refuse on the artifact — a `DONE` out of `ship` claims nothing a read
 * could falsify, and refusing one would leave a shipper with no legal terminal over a merge that
 * really did land. It cannot refuse on an unread board either: a read that failed answers `unknown`
 * and records **no** `partial`, which leaves the line nominable by `lane reconcile` rather than
 * stranding the shipper.
 *
 * **The closure is read off the PR this very event names, never off the nominator**. The
 * shipper hands the merged PR's URL to `lane report --pr`, and it is relayed here as
 * {@link ProveOptions.pr}; `./closure.ts` reads that one PR and judges its body, exactly as
 * `lane reconcile` reads the PR a recorded line names. Nominating was structurally unable to see
 * the subject: a merged `Part of #N` is a node in neither half of the union — the closing edge is
 * built from closing keywords and the search half is `is:open` — so the `Partial` arm the machine
 * declares never once fired, and every partial merge still folded its lane to a terminal over an open
 * issue.
 *
 * An answered read names the merged PRs it stood on, and `lane report` records them beside the
 * polarity. That is what lets a later sweep tell a `false` this reader wrote from a `false` the
 * nominator fell through to, which the polarity alone cannot say and no timestamp can either.
 *
 * A `closes` answer also reads the issue back, because merge-queue merges have left a `Fixes #N`
 * issue open. The answer rides {@link ProofOutcome.closingMerge}; this verb writes nothing.

/**
 * Every namespace this PR's diff derives that the state being left owes, judged at its live head.
 *
 * The derivation is `ship scope`'s own pair — the `ui`-bearing partition and the namespace map that
 * appends the `governance` floor — so the bar this proves against is the same object the merge gate
 * enforces rather than a second reading of it.
 *
 * `defers` is the one subtraction, and it is a routing fact rather than a relaxation: it is
 * non-empty only where this lane's own machine takes the deferred namespace's event into the cell
 * that owes it, so a subtraction can never outlive the round it hands the work to. Demanding
 * `review-ui` of the very `PASS` that enters `review:ui` demanded a verdict from a cell the lane
 * had not reached; demanding it of a `PASS` that walks to `ship` is the floor, and it still stands.
 * `ship gate` re-derives the full set at the merge either way.
 *
 * **A deferral this head derives nothing for is refused rather than taken.** The head decides which
 * classes a review round owes, so once one exists the standing set has to come from it; a `ui`
 * stamp that outlived a text-only fix routes the `PASS` into a rendered round the diff cannot fill,
 * and the rendered gate then parks the lane on a person. That read comes back `Underived`, and the
 * remedy on the refusal is the relay.
 *
 * @ruling https://github.com/kamp-us/phoenix/issues/9169#issuecomment-5688656577
 *
 * On a control-plane PR the reviewer's PASS arrives through the §CP advisory carrier by design —
 * no first-line marker, the head in the body — so a marker-only read would row it
 * `absent` and hold the lane at `PROOF_IN_FLIGHT` forever. The advisory is read exactly as
 * `ship gate`'s `candidateOf` reads it: head-bound with no content binding, a `[FAIL]`
 * row treated as fail (an invalid emission, reported) — and admitted only after the diff itself
 * classifies control-plane through the shipped `classify` over CODEOWNERS at the PR's base ref,
 * never a caller assertion. On any other PR a marker-less comment stays no verdict.
 *
 * The third carrier is the `routed-elsewhere` record, read for `ROUTABLE` alone and admitted for
 * the reason `ship gate` admits it: `review-ui`'s emit path cannot answer a diff that renders
 * nothing, so requiring the namespace without reading the route would hold such a lane at `review`
 * with no work left that could free it. It is read exactly as `candidateOf` reads it —
 * head-bound, no content binding, one namespace.
 *
 * The read stops at the rows. Which bar is asked of them is the caller's, because the two bars are
 * opposite: a `PASS` must clear {@link foldNamespaces}'s floor, a park must only survive
 * {@link foldPark}'s single contradiction.
 *
 * It is exported for the one caller outside this verb that asks the same question of a PR no lane
 * is folded over yet — [`board-seat.ts`](board-seat.ts)'s admission. Sharing the read is the point:
 * the bar a board-seated boot clears is the bar the `PASS` it stands in for would have had to.

 * no cell and no verb that could ever free it. Which cell then owes it is not bookkeeping —
 * one epic run is one branch and one PR, so the tail PR's own diff carries every rendered file the
 * child's range added, and the tail's `PASS` derives, requires and proves it at a head a preview
 * exists for. A child whose range renders nothing derives the namespace nowhere, so the subtraction
 * is a no-op on its bar and on its notes.
 *
 * What binds is content and only content: the two
 * SHAs a range marker names stop being history the moment the range merges into the epic branch, so
 * `bindRange` compares the digest the reviewer recorded against the digest this range carries now —
 * a verdict written over a sibling's range, or over a tip the builder has since moved past, reads
 * `Stale` and refuses.
 *
 * A comment carrying a PR-scoped marker is `Malformed` to this reader rather than absent, and is
 * counted into the diagnostics instead of dropped: a verdict posted in the wrong format is the one
 * failure that would otherwise present as "the reviewer never ran".
 *
 * A `routed-elsewhere` record resolves `ROUTABLE` here too — a child's rendered-surface diff can
 * render nothing exactly as a PR's can — and it binds the range's **tip**, not the range digest.
 * The record's format is head-bound by construction and carries no digest to compare, so
 * the tip is the one object name the tree it attested has; every push moves it and voids the route.
