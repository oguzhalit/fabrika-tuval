/**
 * The append lock's own contract at unit tier: a writer that finds the lock held refuses
 * {@link CONCURRENT_WRITE} — distinguishable from an ordinary machine refusal — with the log left
 * byte-identical, while the uncontended path behaves exactly as it did before the lock existed.
 *
 * The stale-lock half is here too, and it is the one with four answers rather than two: a lock aged
 * past the horizon is stolen, a younger one is not, a second waiter already past that horizon still
 * does not get the lock the first one just took, and an explicit budget refuses before any of it is
 * asked. Only the second of those was ever covered.
 *
 * Contention here is scripted (`mkdirExisting`, `duringStat`), not raced: the point is the
 * *deterministic* half of the guarantee, down to placing one writer's whole run inside the other's
 * check-then-act window. The probabilistic half — that two live processes actually collide often
 * enough for the guard to matter — lives in [`append-race.cli.test.ts`](append-race.cli.test.ts),
 * which races real processes against one ledger.
