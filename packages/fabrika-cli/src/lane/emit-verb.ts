/**
 * `lane emit` — generate one epic's lane machine from its board state and place it as a new lane.
 *
 * The board reads ride the shipped readers (`getIssue` via `openIssue`, the native sub-issue list
 * via `plan/github.ts`), the emission is the pure `emit.ts`, and the placement is the same guarded
 * boot `lane open` uses. Every topology defect seats on its own code, because each takes a
 * different remedy: plan the epic, fix the reference, break the cycle. The unparseable arm's remedy
 * is a placement: the parser refuses a prose line inside the section on purpose (a mistyped edge must
 * never read as no edge), and `readTopology` ends the section at the first thematic break, so the
 * refusal names where such a line belongs instead of loosening the grammar to take it.
 *
 * `--children` is the descope escape: a founder who unlinks a child leaves the body's topology naming
 * it, and without the flag that is `16` forever. It is opt-in and not the default because the same
 * stale ref is a typo on the other reading, where dropping the child silently emits a machine short
 * one region. The `16` refusal names both escapes — this flag, and `ledger retopology`, which
 * repairs the body instead of routing around it.
 *
 * An existing lane is refused, and nothing carves an exception into that refusal: an overwrite path
 * for a lane already on disk by name was rejected, and that left
 * `placeMachine`'s refusal standing as the answer. What this verb owes instead is a refusal that
 * names the remedy exactly — retire the directory, then re-run it — so a wrong-template lane
 * is a two-step repair an operator can read off the line rather than a dead end.
 *
 * That remedy is for the wrong MACHINE, and it is not the one a changed PLAN takes: re-emitting
 * discards `events.jsonl` and every landed child's record with it. A running lane whose topology
 * moved is [`amend-verb.ts`](amend-verb.ts)'s, which re-derives the machine over the log it keeps.
 *
 * The epic lane's origin is written as its first fact ([`facts.ts`](facts.ts)) right after the
 * machine is placed, exactly as `lane open` writes a single-issue lane's.
