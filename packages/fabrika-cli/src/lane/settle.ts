/**
 * Which board closures entitle which terminal, and which entitle none.
 *
 * The whole judgement `lane settle` makes, held apart from the verb so it is testable without a
 * network, and reading no disk and no board of its own. The verb hands it what one issue read and
 * one pull-request read said; this decides what those entitle.
 *
 * **Four answers, never two.** A not-planned or duplicate close is a cancellation. A completed close
 * whose issue is linked by at least one merged pull request is a landing — the work shipped outside
 * this lane's own flow, which is what a hand-shipped lane looks like. An open issue is live work.
 * Everything else, including a read that failed and a completed close with no merged linking PR, is
 * UNKNOWN, and UNKNOWN appends nothing: these two terminals are proven from nothing on disk, so the
 * board read IS their evidence, and folding a failed or empty read into either arm invents the fact
 * the terminal is supposed to stand on.
 *
 * **A caller may supply the link the body lacks, and never the merge.** Plenty of merged work cites
 * one issue in its body and closes another by hand, which leaves a lane whose landing is real and
 * unreadable. `--landed-by <pr>` names that merge; the board still has to say it merged, and the
 * line records that a caller asserted the link rather than a body proving it.
