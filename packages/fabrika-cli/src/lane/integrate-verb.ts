/**
 * `lane integrate` — land one reviewed child on an epic run's assembly branch, and prove the merged
 * tree holds together before the branch keeps it.
 *
 * The order is the whole verb: merge, reconcile the merged tree's dependencies from the lockfile it
 * now carries, then run the repo's code validators. Reversing the middle two steps is what broke
 * a real run: an assembly worktree placed before the child existed still had the pre-merge install,
 * so the typecheck failed on a tree whose code was fine, and a valid child
 * spent a lane retry on stale worktree state. Every refusal below the merge resets the branch
 * through `ORIG_HEAD`, so a recorded `FAIL` names a branch that never carried the bad merge.
 *
 * Above the merge sits the other half of that guarantee: a seat already holding modified tracked
 * files is refused on exit 45 before anything runs, because dirt the child did not write reads as
 * its conflict or its bad lockfile and spends its retry budget either way.
 *
 * A textual collision is not always the end of the run: under `assemblyReplay.onCollision`, the
 * child's commits are replayed onto the tip and the plain keep-both hunks kept both ways, which is
 * the repair a hand-resolved cross-child collision always was (`replay.ts`). The key ships `off`, so
 * a repo declaring nothing gets the refusal byte for byte. The replay also moves the child's branch
 * onto the range it replayed, and refuses on exit 54 rather than merging when it cannot: the branch
 * is where every later read takes the child's range from, so one left on superseded commits sends
 * the child's next integrate into a collision with this one's own landing. A refusal below the merge
 * puts that branch back too, so a replay this verb did not keep leaves the graded range where its
 * reviewer left it — see {@link restore}.
 *
 * Publishing the merged head is `lane push`'s job; the driver records `DONE`. This verb neither
 * pushes nor writes the lane log. See ./command.ts help for its report format.

/**
 * Put the assembly branch back where the merge found it, and prove it went.

 * `reset --hard <to>` is the move; the re-read of HEAD against the sha captured before the merge is
 * what makes it an answer rather than a claim. A branch that will not go back is UNKNOWN, never a
 * plain `FAIL` — it may still carry the merge no verdict admits.
 *
 * The merge and validator paths reset through `ORIG_HEAD`, which the merge itself wrote. The replay
 * path passes the captured sha instead: `git cherry-pick` writes no `ORIG_HEAD`, so on that path the
 * ref names whatever the last thing that did wrote, and resetting to it would be a guess. The proof
 * is the same either way.
 *
 * `reseat` is the replay path's other half, and without it the restore was only half a restore. A
 * replay moves the child's branch onto the replayed range **before** the merge, which is right while
 * the merge stands: the replayed commits are the child's range then, and a branch left on the
 * originals collides with this run's own landing. When a refusal below the merge takes the merge
 * away, that stops being true — the assembly branch goes back and the child would be left naming
 * commits no reviewer graded and nothing carries, with no event to say so, because a refusal writes
 * no stdout. So the branch goes back too, and the graded range never moved at all.
