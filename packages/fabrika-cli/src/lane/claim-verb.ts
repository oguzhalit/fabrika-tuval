/**
 * `lane claim` / `lane release` — the driver's end of the claim protocol, in one file because
 * splitting a claim from its release is how the two come to disagree about who holds a lane.
 *
 * Same race as `build claim`'s, one namespace over (`./claim.ts`): post the marker, **re-read**, and
 * the earliest authorized marker wins. Posting alone only detects a race; the checkpoint read is what
 * resolves it. A loser retracts its **own** marker and nothing else — never another lane's, which is
 * the one write this protocol must never make.
 *
 * **Ownership turns on the whole token, never on the session id alone**. A session is not a
 * driver: one session routinely spawns several operators, and each mints its own token. Under the
 * session-only rule a sibling lane read the first lane's marker as its own, so `claim` answered `won`
 * carrying a token that owned nothing and `release` deleted the holder's marker — an unrecoverable
 * retraction that left the issue reading unclaimed. Every ownership question here is therefore asked
 * as a {@link Caller} carrying the lane's nonce, read off the `--token` this verb's own `claim`
 * handed back.
 *
 * **One driver leaves at most one marker on a thread**, the same fixed point `build claim` holds,
 * scoped per lane. `claim` handed the token it already holds reads ownership before
 * writing and answers `won` with that same marker, posting nothing; `release` sweeps every marker
 * carrying THIS lane's token rather than only the winner. Without both, N claims left N markers and
 * each release peeled one off a stack, and since nothing here expires a marker (`triage claim`'s TTL
 * has no counterpart in this namespace) the leftovers made the lane refuse on `31` until a human
 * deleted the comment.
 *
 * **No admission test runs here.** The fence decides what may start *building*, and the
 * builder this driver spawns runs it on its own account; a second copy in the driver would refuse a
 * lane at a different moment than the shell it drives, for reasons the driver is type-blind to.
 *
 * **`adopt` is the third verb, and it is what a killed seat's successor runs**, in parity
 * with the build namespace's own succession: the successor states on the board that a seat is gone
 * and inherits its claim, so `release` then answers `Mine` and retracts the claim and the adopt
 * together. No TTL, no lease, no steal.
 *
 * **An adopt marker is never a comment no verb can reach.** The claim it adopts may already be gone —
 * an operator adopts a released claim, or adopts twice — and `release` then resolved `Unclaimed` and
 * answered "nothing to retract" while `claim` went on counting the comment and losing to it under a
 * fresh nonce every pass. Deleting the comment by hand was the only way out, which is the one act
 * the lane-succession decision exists to remove. `release` now reads that stranded adopt as this
 * driver's own and retracts it alone, and an adopt fences and confers only over a claim marker it postdates.
