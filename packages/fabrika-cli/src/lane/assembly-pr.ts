/**
 * The two pieces of prose an epic run's single assembly PR opens with, derived from the epic issue.
 *
 * The title used to be the literal `feat(epic): #<n> one-PR run`, hardcoded in the operate skill's
 * `gh pr create` fence. The repo squash-merges with `squash_merge_commit_title:
 * COMMIT_OR_PR_TITLE`, so five epics landed on `main` under a subject that is a lane key with no
 * sentence in it. The derivation belongs here rather than in shell expansion because the fence must
 * stay literal, and because the conventional prefix has exactly one home: `feat` comes from
 * `../build/pr-title.ts`, the same read a builder PR's title makes, and this module only stamps the
 * `(epic)` scope over it.
 *
 * The About section's source is the epic's `## Pitch` **Problem** paragraph, read through
 * `../guard/pitch.ts`'s own section reader so a pitch means the same thing here as it does at
 * intake. `../build/pr-body.ts` refuses a body carrying a stray closing keyword or a classification
 * claim, and an epic's Problem paragraph is ordinary prose that may hold either — but the two are
 * not the same problem. A closing keyword acts on GitHub whoever wrote it, so the keyword is
 * swapped. A classification claim is a claim, and that module strips block quotes before it looks
 * for one, for the stated reason that a quotation reproduces text rather than asserting it: so the
 * lifted paragraph lands as a block quote, whole, in the epic's own words. Rewriting `type:epic` to
 * `type epic` instead would leave the assertion standing in the sentence a person reads while the
 * pattern that keys on the colon stops matching — a claim edited into something that only looks
 * safe.
 *
 * The text is bounded to the opening sentences a reader will actually read, and the assembled
 * section is then re-read through `pr-body.ts`'s own predicates, so a section this module answers
 * cannot be one the PR guard refuses.
