/**
 * Whether a lanes root stands where its ledger really lives — the two facts that can be wrong, their
 * refusals, and the guard every rooted `lane` verb runs through.
 *
 * A lanes root is a path (`.fabrika/lanes`, `.fabrika/chores`), so a relative one is joined onto
 * whatever cwd the process happens to hold. When that cwd drifts off the repo — a session scratchpad,
 * a subdirectory — the root resolves somewhere nobody meant, and the load path proves the lane
 * *absent*: the same `7` a repo with no such lane answers, which `operate` reads as "boot a fresh
 * ledger". A drifted-cwd boot then writes a second ledger over a live lane. "Not a repo" is a
 * different fact from "no lane here", and only the second may mean boot.
 *
 * An **absolute** root expresses no cwd drift, but it owes a probe of its own: it can still point at
 * a *linked worktree's* copy of a lanes root. `.fabrika` is gitignored, so no worktree inherits one
 * from its branch — but anything that writes a lanes root under a worktree makes a second ledger for
 * the same lane, and folding it answers from a frozen moment instead of failing. That is what lane
 * 8810 did: a shell folded a worktree copy, read a `tripped` lane whose task was `frozen`, and
 * refused a terminal the live ledger would have taken. So every root, absolute or relative, is
 * proven to sit in the working tree that OWNS it, and one inside a linked worktree is refused on
 * {@link ROOT_NOT_OWNED} rather than read.
