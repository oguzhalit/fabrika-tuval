/**
 * Recording a cleared repair round into a lane's own event log.
 *
 * Where a pull request carries the grant, the clearance lives on it and is audited there
 * (`../build/clearances.ts`), and this is the local half: the lane's guard reads
 * `retries < maxRetries` off the fold, so a lane that never heard about the grant freezes the same
 * repair `build verdicts` says still has budget. Appending a `<TASK>.CLEARED` event is what keeps
 * the two readers on one derivation (`../cap-clearance.ts`). Both verbs write both halves —
 * `build clear` posts the marker and bumps the lane, `lane clear` appends here and posts the marker
 * through `./pr-grant.ts` — so neither seat leaves one reader holding budget the other refuses.
 *
 * Where the lane has no pull request — an epic child, a chore lane — there is no board half at all,
 * and this log line is the whole grant. `lane clear` is the verb for that seat, and the `rationale`
 * it requires is that grant's only audit.
 *
 * **The grant is an event, never a field.** It used to be written into the task's `clearedRounds`
 * context and read back at replay time, which let a clearance recorded today change how yesterday's
 * `FAIL` routed — it stranded a legally-recorded `UNBLOCKED` in a state with no cell for
 * it and bricked every verb on the lane. Appended, the budget is a fold over the events
 * before each position, so a recorded event keeps the routing it took.
 *
 * **Set semantics, so a re-run buys nothing.** The append happens only when the log holds no
 * `CLEARED` for that round on that task, which makes reconciling an interrupted grant safe: the
 * operator re-runs the verb and the budget is the same as if it had landed the first time.
