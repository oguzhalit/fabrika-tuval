/**
 * The board seat — the one arm out of `lane open`'s prior-lane refusal (exit 63), and what the board
 * has to prove before it opens.
 *
 * A ledger is a lane's whole state and `.fabrika/` is gitignored, so a lane driven on another
 * operator's machine leaves this checkout nothing to resume. The refusal is right that re-booting
 * over it would launder a spent repair budget, and it had no arm at all for the one case where the
 * prior ledger is unreachable forever: a successor driver holding a verified pull request ended with
 * no verb that moved it.
 *
 * **What this module adds is a seat the board proves, not a way past the guard.** Two halves, and
 * they are separate on purpose:
 *
 * - **Admission is the merge gate's own bar.** Exactly one pull request hangs off the issue, and
 *   every namespace its head derives has answered — the same {@link foldNamespaces} fold `lane prove`
 *   takes for a `PASS`. A standing `FAIL` means a repair round is owed and nothing here can say how
 *   many the prior lane already spent, so it stays refused; so does a verdict that no longer binds
 *   the head, an unread board, and several pull requests.
 * - **The budget is seated at zero whatever the board said.** The board proves the work is verified;
 *   it proves nothing about how many repair rounds the prior lane burned. So the placed document
 *   declares `maxRetries: 0` — a `FAIL` on this lane parks at `human:budget-spent` immediately, and
 *   a round comes back the one way it always did, through a grant recorded on the board.
 *
 * The seat is read through a caller-passed reader, the shape [`prior-lane.ts`](prior-lane.ts)
 * established, so `lane open`'s unit tier stays offline. An unreadable half is `Unknown`, never a
 * seat: reading a failed read as "verified" is the permissive arm the whole refusal exists to close.
