/**
 * The lane store — where a lane lives on disk, and the one guarded read every verb goes through.
 *
 * A lane is a directory: `<root>/<key>/workflow.json` (the machine document, placed there by the
 * operator from a committed template) plus `events.jsonl` (the append-only log, born on the first
 * recorded event) — `.fabrika/lanes/<n>/` for an issue lane, `.fabrika/chores/<name>/` for a chore
 * lane. Lane state is local and gitignored — the repo `.gitignore`'s `/.fabrika/` entry covers it.
 * Which root a key resolves to is [`key.ts`](key.ts)'s call, not this module's.
 *
 * The load keeps four outcomes apart because they take opposite remedies: the lane is provably not
 * there, it could not be read (UNKNOWN, never "fresh"), it was read in full and is not the shape,
 * or it loaded. An absent `events.jsonl` alone is NOT one of them — a lane with no events yet is a
 * well-formed fresh lane, not a fault.
