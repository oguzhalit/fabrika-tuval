/**
 * The gated move one lane takes when its log will never replay — the whole of `lane archive`'s
 * decision, with none of its wording.
 *
 * `lane archive --sweep` is the one caller. The named single-lane route is
 * [`archive-verb.ts`](archive-verb.ts)'s own judgement and no longer comes through here: the
 * decision that retired its closed-issue gate gave it a claim retraction the sweep does not make, so
 * the two answer different questions and sharing one module would state a gate the named route does
 * not run.
 *
 * Every arm below is a PROVEN fact about one lane, never a message: the caller composes the prose, so
 * the sweep is not stuck parsing a refusal to find out what happened. The order of the two gates is
 * a cost decision: the replay judgement is local and free, the closure read is one request, so a
 * replaying lane is refused before the board is ever asked.
