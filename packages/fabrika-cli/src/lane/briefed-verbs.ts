/**
 * Whether the tree a brief's `fabrika:` entrypoint will resolve in actually carries the lane verbs
 * the brief instructs the shell to run.
 *
 * The entrypoint is repo-relative in a checkout, so it resolves inside the *shell's* worktree, not
 * the driver's. An epic run cuts its assembly branch once and every child's worktree comes off that
 * branch, so a lane verb that landed on the trunk after the cut is simply absent from the copy of
 * this CLI the child will run — and the shell then does real work, produces a real verdict, and
 * cannot record it. Reading the branch's own tree before the brief is emitted is what turns that
 * quiet loss into a refusal the driver can act on (`lane refresh`).
 *
 * Only a brief whose ground names an assembly branch is judged, and only in a checkout: an absolute
 * entrypoint is an installed copy the branch does not carry at all, so the branch's tree says
 * nothing about it, and every other brief's shell stands in a worktree cut from the driver's own
 * head — the tree this very process is running out of.
