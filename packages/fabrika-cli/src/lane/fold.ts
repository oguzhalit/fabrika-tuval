/**
 * The fold — `events.jsonl` in, lane state out, every invocation from scratch.
 *
 * Fold = state: there is no resident process and no snapshot, a verb re-folds the whole log each
 * run — measured trivially fast at operator scale. Tasks are independent regions,
 * so the global log partitions cleanly and each task's messages fold through its own machine.
 *
 * `deriveStatus` is the whole "compound machine": the active phase is the first whose tasks are not
 * all final, and a completed phase with a task in an error final trips the workflow — the
 * `noErrors` gate as a pure derivation, never a machine event. Everything here returns a
 * discriminated union rather than throwing, so a verb's refusal is data it seats on an exit code.

/**
 * One appended line of `events.jsonl`: which task, which (namespaced) event, when — plus, on an
 * event a shell reported through `lane report`, the artifact refs its terminal named, on a
 * `BLOCKED`, the closed-set cause of the park, and the lane classes the recorder observed
 * at that moment. Those three refs are evidence carried verbatim.
 *
 * `round`, `classes`, `waitGrant` and `partial` are not evidence — they are the payloads the fold
 * reads. A `CLEARED` line without a `round` names no round to clear, `classes` is what a
 * `class:<name>` guard routes on, `waitGrant` is the waits a resume buys, which rides
 * the `UNBLOCKED` line so one recorded event both clears a queue stall and pays for the read the
 * lane resumes to take, and `partial` says the merge behind a ship's `DONE` left its
 * issue open, which is what the `merge:partial` guard routes on. It is recorded at both
 * polarities, so absent means "nobody read the closure", never "the merge closed it": the fold still
 * routes an absent one down the closing arm, and every line written before the field existed folds
 * exactly as it did, but a reader asking which lines were never confirmed can now tell.
 * `landed` is that `partial`'s evidence — the merged pull requests the closure read stood on — and
 * it is what makes a recorded `false` legible after the fact: one naming its evidence was read off a
 * PR, one naming none fell through a nominator that could not see the subject, and no timestamp on
 * the line distinguishes them.
 *
 * `diagnosis` is the third payload of that kind and rides a `DONE` out of build: it says the
 * terminal was proven off a diagnosis comment rather than a pull request, which is what the
 * `done:diagnosis` guard routes on. Only `true` routes, so an absent field folds exactly as it
 * always did, and every line written before the field existed still reaches `review`.
 *
 * `deferred` is the fourth kind: not evidence and not a payload the fold reads, but the disclosure
 * that this `PASS` was proven over a set short the namespaces named — the routed `review-ui` an
 * epic child hands to its epic's tail. Without it a deferred `PASS` and a whole-set one are
 * the same line, and nothing in the ledger says a rendered verdict is still owed anywhere.
 *
 * `routed` is that disclosure's complement, and it rides the opposite answer: the namespaces this
 * `PASS` was proven over on a head-bound **route** rather than a verdict — nobody owes one, because
 * the rendered gate published a record saying this PR is not its to judge. `deferred` says a verdict
 * is still owed somewhere; `routed` says none is owed at all. Without it the `PASS` a satisfied
 * route earns is byte-identical to one a rendered gate passed.
 *
 * `tasks` is the sixth and rides one line only, an {@link AMENDED_EVENT}: the task set the
 * re-derived machine holds. It is the whole audit of a topology amendment — the log is append-only,
 * so the machine that folded the lines above this one is gone, and this field is what says which
 * task set replaced which.
 *
 * `corrects` is the fifth and rides one line only, a {@link CORRECTED_EVENT}: the `at` of the
 * earlier entry of this same task whose `partial` or `integrate` payload this line supersedes — one
 * of the two, never both. It is the one field naming another line, and it is how a fact recorded
 * before its field existed is repaired without any recorded line changing — see
 * {@link applyCorrections}.
