/**
 * Two real processes racing one lane ledger — the probabilistic half of the lock's evidence.
 *
 * The deterministic half (a scripted held lock refuses CONCURRENT_WRITE with the log untouched)
 * lives in [`append-lock.unit.test.ts`](append-lock.unit.test.ts). What that tier cannot prove is
 * that two live processes launched against the same ledger actually interleave badly enough for
 * the guard to matter, and that when they do, the outcome stays coherent: every appended line
 * parses, every exit is one of the three legal seats (won / machine-refused / lock-refused), and an
 * event that did not win never reaches the log.
 *
 * A fourth seat used to sit beside those, and its retirement is why the set here is narrower than
 * the one the first ruling below widened. A writer's first load runs before the lock on purpose,
 * and on a fresh lane `events.jsonl` does not exist yet, so `loadLane` read a `NotFound` and then
 * probed the path to tell "absent" from "unreadable" — two instants. A winner appending in between flipped the
 * probe, and the loser reported `LANE_UNREADABLE` about a log that was genuinely absent when it
 * read. `loadLane` now decides that split off the read's own failure, so the probe cannot
 * contradict it and no writer in this race can reach `LANE_UNREADABLE`.
 *
 * The children run this checkout's own `src/bin.ts` under node's type stripping — no build step on
 * the gate path. Collision frequency depends on real scheduling, so the invariants are asserted
 * across repeated pairs rather than trusting one lucky race.
