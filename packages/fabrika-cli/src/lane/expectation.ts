/**
 * The board read [`shape.ts`](shape.ts)'s judgement needs — is this issue an epic, how many
 * sub-issue links does it carry, and does it hang under a parent — plus the classes its labels
 * declare, which `lane open` seeds into the placed document.
 *
 * The parent edge rides the `getIssue` call already made — `IssueRecord.parent` is populated from
 * the single read's own payload — so the third fact costs no further request. Epic wins the
 * precedence: a sub-epic routes to `lane emit` like any other epic, and its parenthood changes
 * nothing about which machine it needs.
 *
 * Two reads rather than one, because an epic's two halves of life answer differently and the window
 * between them is the whole incident. A planned epic carries children. An epic nobody has
 * planned yet carries none, and the only thing on the board saying what it is, is its `type:epic`
 * label — so keying on children alone reads a pre-plan epic as an ordinary issue, which is exactly
 * the lane that came up on the single-task coder template at 16:30 before `plan-epic` ever ran.
 *
 * A reader a caller passes rather than a seam a verb reaches through on its own, which is what keeps
 * `lane open` and `lane migrate` provably offline everywhere they are handed `null` — the shape
 * `lane stale`'s claim pairing established.
 *
 * An unreadable answer is `Unknown`, never `Single`. Reading a failed read as "not an epic" is how a
 * wrong-machine boot would slip through the very refusal this exists to make.
