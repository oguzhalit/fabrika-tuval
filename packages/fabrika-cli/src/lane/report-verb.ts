/**
 * `lane report` — a shell records its own terminal token, mapped to one operator event in code.
 *
 * The channel between a shell and the ledger used to be prose the operator re-read out of a
 * transcript; this verb closes it: token in, [`report.ts`](report.ts)'s map picks the event, and
 * the append rides `transition`'s exact path — validate against the folded state FIRST, append only
 * what the machine accepts, refuse everything else with the log left byte-identical. The optional
 * `--pr`/`--comment` refs land on the event line itself, so an event names its evidence at the
 * moment the shell knows the URL. One more field lands there and it is the prover's rather than the
 * caller's: `deferred`, relayed off the proof's own answer and never recomposed here, says this
 * `PASS` was proven over a set short the namespaces named — the routed `review-ui` an epic child
 * hands to its epic's tail, which nothing else in the ledger records. `partial` is the second of
 * that kind and rides the ship stage's `DONE`: it says whether the merge behind this terminal
 * carried `Part of #N` and left the issue open, which is the whole input to the machine's
 * `merge:partial` arm. It rides at both polarities — a closing merge records `partial: false` — so
 * the line says the closure was read rather than leaving a later sweep to read it again. `landed`
 * is that read's evidence and rides beside it: the merged PRs the closure judged, so a recorded
 * `false` says which reader wrote it and not only which way it fell. `diagnosis` is the third and
 * rides a `DONE` out of build: it says this terminal was proven off a diagnosis comment rather than
 * a pull request, which is what the machine's `done:diagnosis` arm carries an investigation to its
 * own terminal on instead of the review it opened nothing for. It rides at `true` only, because the
 * three builder terminals that reach this verb all report one `DONE` and only the prover can tell
 * them apart.
 *
 * **A closing merge's issue is read back, and closed here if it stayed open.** A merged `Fixes #N`
 * has left #N open, so the ship `DONE`'s proof reads the issue after a `closes` answer. On `Open`
 * this verb posts a comment naming the merge and closes the issue as completed — the one issue write
 * it makes, and never `lane prove`'s. `issueClose` lands on the line saying which of
 * [`closing-merge.ts`](closing-merge.ts)'s four answers happened, so a failed close or an unread
 * issue is on the record rather than folded into a plain `complete`.
 *
 * **A queue wait is floored as well as counted.** A `ship:queued` re-fold that arrives before
 * `WAIT_FLOOR_SECONDS` of elapsed time since the task's last line is refused at `WAIT_TOO_SOON` with
 * the log byte-identical, so the wait budget measures how long a PR has sat rather than how fast a
 * driver passes.
 *
 * **A token is accepted only from a state its shell serves.** [`report.ts`](report.ts)'s
 * `GROUP_SERVES` names the leaves each vocabulary group reports out of, and a token none of its
 * owners serves from the task's leaf is refused at `TOKEN_UNSERVED`, before the proof and again under
 * the lock. A late builder's `SHIPPED-PR` out of `ship` otherwise maps to the same `DONE` a
 * shipper's `LANDED` does, and folds a lane with an open PR to `complete`.
 *
 * **One token names two events, and the proof picks.** `ROUTED-ELSEWHERE` out of `review:ui` is
 * [`report.ts`](report.ts)'s one {@link PROOF_CONDITIONAL_TERMINALS} row: a published head-bound
 * route beside a complete set of binding verdicts is a *finished* review, so the terminal records
 * the `PASS` that finish earns instead of a park the board itself contradicts. The advanced arm is
 * tried, never assumed — the lane's own machine must hold the transition and `lane prove` must earn
 * it unmodified — and every shortfall falls through to the park the flat table maps, byte-for-byte
 * as before. `routed` rides the line that lands, so the ledger says the `PASS` stood on a route
 * rather than on a rendered verdict nobody wrote.
 *
 * **The append is proof-gated.** A token is still a self-report, and moving the recorder from the
 * operator into the shell must not move the bar: between the machine's acceptance and the append
 * this verb runs the same read `lane prove` runs, so a `DONE` and a `PASS` enter the ledger with
 * their artifact behind them or not at all, a reviewer's park enters it only while no `FAIL` at the
 * head says the run reached a verdict, and every other event answers `not-required` — or
 * `not-walkable`, where this lane's machine walks no such event out of the task's leaf — without
 * a board read. A refusal is returned on the prover's own code, log untouched — the codes and their
 * remedies are `lane prove`'s, unchanged. The prover is a parameter so this verb's unit tier stays
 * offline; the CLI always hands it `runProve`, which is the only prover a shell ever invokes.
