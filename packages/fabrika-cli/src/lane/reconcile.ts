 * A body carrying both link kinds does not land there and must not: `landedFor` reads
 * `referencedIssues`, so an epic tail reaches this judgement over its epic, and `traceClosure` tests
 * the closing kind per issue rather than body-wide — the tail closes its children and answers
 * `Partial` for the epic it named with `Part of`. Reading it as `Closes` is the permissive fold.
