/**
 * The repo's `parkCause` rule, resolved once for both recorders.
 *
 * `lane report` and `lane transition` both append a `BLOCKED`, so both owe the same answer to
 * "may this park name no cause?". Deciding it in each verb is how the two drift — the shape
 * `config/ci-producer.ts` exists to prevent one layer up.
 *
 * An unreadable or malformed `parkCause` refuses rather than falling back to the shipped default:
 * whether this repo allows a cause-less park is then UNKNOWN, and a fallback would silently restore
 * the permissive arm in a repo that declared the strict one.
