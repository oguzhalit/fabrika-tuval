/**
 * The one commit range an epic run's child built, read off this tree's refs and object database.
 *
 * Off the tree rather than off a search index because a child's work is never published: nothing on
 * GitHub knows it exists until the epic's single PR opens at the tail. The branch is
 * nominated by `build branch`'s own grammar (`../build/lane.ts`'s `childLaneBranches`, never a second
 * regex) and the range is then the evidence — a branch is only a name until commits naming this
 * child sit on it.
 *
 * **This answers what the tree says; the exit code is the caller's.** `lane prove` reads the answer
 * as a proof and `lane brief` hands the same two endpoints to the reviewer it dispatches, so the
 * two verbs cannot name different ranges for one child — the defect that let a brief print
 * `epic/<n>..HEAD`, which the *spawned* shell re-resolved in its own worktree to an empty range.
