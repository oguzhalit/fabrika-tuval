/**
 * A lane's facts — what the lane is, beside what it did.
 *
 * `events.jsonl` is the machine's log: every line folds through a task's machine, and a line no
 * machine holds a cell for is a replay defect. Where a lane came from, and what it is waiting on,
 * move no task, so they live in their own append-only `facts.jsonl` beside the log and no fold
 * ever reads them. The lane directory moves as a whole on archive, so the two files never part.
 *
 * Two kinds, both closed. An `origin` line is written once, at boot, by `lane open` or `lane emit`
 * through {@link recordOrigin}; a lane carrying none — booted before this file existed — reads as a
 * driver pick, the default the ruling names. A `waiting` line is written by `lane wait`, and the
 * latest one stands.
