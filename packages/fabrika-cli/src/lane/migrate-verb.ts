/**
 * `lane migrate` — bring every booted lane's machine up to the committed template, or say why not.
 *
 * The second verb in the group that reads across lanes rather than into one, and for the same reason
 * `lane stale` does: the question is a sweep. A machine change ships in one commit and the lanes
 * carrying the old copy are all of them, so migrating them one key at a time is a loop nobody would
 * run to the end.
 *
 * Every lane is judged before anything is written to it, and each is judged on its own: a lane that
 * cannot be migrated is a row, never the end of the sweep, because refusing the whole answer over
 * one lane would leave every other lane on a machine its driver is about to break. The write is the
 * last thing that happens on a lane and only on a `Preserved` verdict ({@link judgeMigration}).
 *
 * `--check` is the same sweep with the write withheld — what a driver runs to find out whether a
 * lane it is about to drive is stale, and what a release runs before merging a machine change.
 *
 * A lane key narrows which entries are swept and nothing else. The whole-root sweep is still what
 * runs unaddressed — it is the release-time shape — but a driver holding one lane is sanctioned to
 * write that lane's document and no other, and before the key existed the only write this verb
 * could perform reached every lane in the root, other drivers' live ones included. Narrowing is a
 * filter over the swept name set: each lane was already judged on its own, so a narrowed run reaches
 * exactly the same verdict for the lane it names as the sweep would have.
 *
 * Staleness is not the only way a lane can be wrong, and it was the only one this sweep could see:
 * a coder-template lane booted on an epic grafts cleanly and reads `current`. So each
 * issue-keyed lane is also judged against the board's answer for its issue ([`shape.ts`](shape.ts)),
 * and a proven mismatch is its own verdict ahead of every migration one. A lane booted for an epic's
 * CHILD is the second such verdict and a different fault: its template is right, so it grafted
 * cleanly and read `current`, and the wrongness is that the directory exists at all beside the
 * parent's. That one is reported and never acted on — retiring a ledger is an operator's act — so a
 * `duplicate` row leaves the exit code where it was. The reader is passed in, so a caller that hands
 * none still gets the wholly offline sweep.
 *
 * The judgement never widens what this verb writes: a mismatched or duplicate lane is skipped, and
 * the read can only turn a write into a skip. That is what keeps this verb's guarantee intact — it
 * writes only where the swap is provably inert.
