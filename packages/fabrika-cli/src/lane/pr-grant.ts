/**
 * The PR-side half of a driver's grant — what `lane clear` records on the lane's pull request.
 *
 * A lane at its cap has two budgets, and they are counted in two logs: the lane machine guards each
 * task with `retries < maxRetries` off the lane's own events, and `build verdicts` folds
 * `capReached` off the FAIL-marker rounds on the PR. A driver clearing only the lane one dispatched
 * a builder that read the PR one and refused without touching the branch — the lane-side grant, the
 * `UNBLOCKED` and a whole shell spent on budget nobody could read. The two are one act now, and the
 * decision record that rules it is in the repository's own corpus; search it for this verb's name.
 * `build clear` stays the seat for a bare PR-side grant with no lane clear behind it.
 *
 * **What moves and what does not.** The document requirement moves: a driver's rationale IS the
 * dated authorization, because a driver acts on its own recommendation and logs it, exactly as it
 * already does on the lane line. The ACL does not: the marker is honoured through
 * `../build/clearances.ts`'s same four clauses, so the account posting it still has to be in the
 * repo's control-plane set — the owners `.github/CODEOWNERS` names — and still has to hold `write+`
 * live.
 * Authority was never the founder document's; it was always the ACL's.
 *
 * **The grant is whole or it is refused.** Every read and both writes happen before `lane clear`
 * appends its own line, so a PR-side grant that cannot be made honourably refuses with the lane log
 * byte-identical rather than leaving a void half-seat — which is the exact failure this module
 * exists to remove. The one asymmetry is deliberate: a task with no pull request answers `NoPull`
 * and the lane-side grant proceeds, because an epic child and a chore lane were always this verb's
 * first seat.
