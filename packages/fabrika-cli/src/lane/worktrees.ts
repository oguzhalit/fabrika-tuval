/**
 * The worktrees a lane's shells were handed — the set `lane cleanup` removes when the run ends.
 *
 * Every shell of a lane runs in a worktree of its own, and the only one the lane used to hear about
 * was the builder's, through an in-flight `working` record that stops standing at the task's next
 * event. So a finished lane left every tree behind with nothing naming them. These records live in
 * their own append-only `worktrees.jsonl` beside the log and are read by no fold: a `handed` line
 * names a tree, a `removed` line retires it, and a tree is in the set while its latest line is
 * `handed`. Nothing here expires with an event.
 *
 * The file is its own rather than a kind in `in-flight.jsonl`, whose reader refuses a kind it does
 * not know: a shell running a newer fabrika than its driver would otherwise break the driver's
 * `lane status`.
 *
 * `removed` exists because a path can be reused. Without it a tree placed later at a path this lane
 * once held would be this lane's to remove.
