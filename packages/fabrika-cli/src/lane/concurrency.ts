/**
 * How many seats the lanes root is holding, and the refusal a boot takes when the repo's declared
 * `laneConcurrencyCap` is full.
 *
 * The count is over the boot's own root and nothing beside it, which is what keeps
 * `.fabrika/lanes-archived` and `.fabrika/chores` out of it without either name appearing here: both
 * are sibling roots, so a lane archived is a lane already gone from this read, and a
 * chore lane is counted by nobody.
 *
 * **A seat is a lane somebody is driving.** A lane whose log folds to `active` holds one only while
 * its issue carries a live `lane claim` marker; an active lane nobody claims is idle, and it is
 * named separately in the refusal rather than counted. The cap was counting every unsettled
 * directory, so finished lanes refused every boot against a live driver count of one. There is no
 * TTL and no heartbeat on the marker — a claim ends when its driver releases it.
 *
 * **What cannot be read still counts.** A lane whose record will not load, whose log will not replay,
 * or whose claim the board would not answer for is not finished — it is a seat nobody can account for
 * — so it counts, and the refusal names it as such. Reading any of those the other way is the
 * permissive arm: a stale directory would silently raise the cap the operator set. The remedy for a
 * dead seat is `lane archive`, `lane settle` or `lane reconcile`, and the refusal says so.
