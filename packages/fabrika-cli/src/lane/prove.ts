/**
 * The proof core — what a lane event claims about the world, and whether the world says it.
 *
 * The retired epic conductor moved on the git graph rather than on its own report. A lane operator
 * owns no branch, so the artifact a lane event claims is one it cannot author: for a single-issue
 * lane and for an epic run's tail, an open PR tracing to the task's issue and a verdict at that PR's
 * head; for an epic run's *child*, which never opens a PR at all, the commits its range
 * adds and a range-bound verdict on the child issue. Everything here is the pure half — facts in,
 * one verdict out — so the whole table is testable without a network and without a checkout.
 *
 * **Four events carry a claim, and two of them claim a negative.** `DONE` out of a `build` state
 * asserts the work exists, `PASS` out of a review state asserts the namespaces that state owes
 * judged it — every derived one out of `review:ui`, every one the plain `review` cell can itself
 * reach out of `review` (see {@link REVIEW_UI_STATE} for why the two differ). `BLOCKED` out of a
 * review state asserts the reviewer's run reached **no** verdict, which one still-binding `FAIL`
 * falsifies ({@link foldPark}). `WIP` out of a review state asserts **no** open PR links the issue
 * any more, which one linking PR falsifies ({@link traceUnlinked}). Any other `WIP`, an
 * `UNBLOCKED`, a `FAIL`, a `BLOCKED` out of `build`, a `DONE` out of `ship` or a `DONE` out of a
 * child's `integrate` asserts nothing a read could falsify — those answer {@link Claim} `None`, so
 * a caller may prove *every* event and still only pay for the four that can lie.
 *
 * **What the two events claim is the same question asked of a different artifact**, and which
 * artifact is structural: {@link roleOf} reads it off the task's own name, exactly as the emitter
 * wrote it. Nothing here chooses a per-run policy, so a child cannot be proven against a PR it was
 * never allowed to open, and a tail cannot be proven against a range nobody judged.
 *
 * The state names are the shipped templates' (`./templates/coder.workflow.json` and the regions
 * `./emit.ts` renders). A machine that renames them derives no claim and says so, which keeps a
 * foreign workflow routable instead of refused.

 * question is whether every required namespace has answered, and "this diff is not mine to judge"
 * is an answer — the one `review-ui`'s evidence-required emit path cannot give for a diff that
 * renders nothing. Without it a lane that ships clean stalls here forever, because no
