/**
 * `lane archive` — move one lane whose log will never replay out of the swept root.
 *
 * The route for a lane no sweep can judge. `lane reconcile` reports such a lane
 * `unreadable` and `lane migrate` refuses it `unsafe` on every run, forever, because the fault is in
 * a log neither may rewrite: an `ISSUE.DONE` appended after the fold reached `frozen` has no update
 * cell and never will. Sealing it would mean appending a line for something that did not happen —
 * the log is append-only and a recorded line is never rewritten — and giving `frozen` the cell
 * would let a lane at its retry cap ship with no unblock. So the lane leaves the sweep's scope by
 * moving, and the log is never touched.
 *
 * **The unreplayable log is the whole entitlement**, and it is what keeps a genuinely broken lane
 * visible: a lane whose log replays is refused with the directory where it was. The archived root is
 * a SIBLING of the swept one, so no sweep learns a skip rule — `reconcile` and `migrate` read the
 * roots they are handed, and the archived one is not among them.
 *
 * **`--retriaged` is the one other entitlement, and it is a separate route rather than a widening.**
 * A lane whose log replays to `diagnosed` with no pull request and no spent round anywhere in it is
 * a builder's no-PR finish, and that final leaves the key occupied: once triage rewrites the issue,
 * `lane open` has nothing to boot into. Under the flag the lane moves on {@link judgeRetriage}'s verdict alone, every
 * other final is refused on {@link NOT_DIAGNOSED}, and the unreplayable route keeps its own gate
 * untouched. An issue re-triaged twice leaves two such ledgers, so this route takes the first free
 * `<lane>`, `<lane>.archived-<n>` slot rather than refusing on the first; the unreplayable route
 * still refuses an occupied destination.
 *
 * **An open issue is no longer a refusal.** A bricked ledger whose issue is still open had
 * no route at all: repair needs the replay that is broken, `settle` needs a board closure, and the
 * archive's own closed-issue gate refused it — so the seat stayed held and the lane could only be
 * deleted by hand, which is the thing an append-only log exists to prevent. The replay judgement
 * already carries what the closure gate was protecting: a log no machine can fold is a lane nobody
 * can drive, whatever the issue says.
 *
 * **The claim dies with the lane, and this verb kills it.** A lane that leaves the swept root while
 * its issue carries a live `lane-claim` marker strands that issue — the next `lane claim` reads a
 * foreign holder and refuses on a lane that is no longer there. So the marker is retracted here,
 * before the move, and a claim this caller does not name refuses on {@link CLAIM_NOT_MINE} rather
 * than being swept out from under its driver — the guard `lane settle` already holds, one act
 * further on. Ownership is raw token equality against the winning claimant, so a dead seat leaves
 * through `lane adopt` and then `lane release`: adopt mints a successor token beside the standing
 * claim, and release is what deletes the marker. Retract-then-move is the safe order: a retraction that lands over a move that does not
 * leaves an unclaimed lane where it was, which the next run archives; the reverse leaves a claim on
 * a lane nothing can release.
