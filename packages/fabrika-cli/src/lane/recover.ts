/**
 * What a non-terminal lane's leaf still owes its ledger — the pure half of `lane recover`.
 *
 * A shell posts its SHA-bound verdict on the artifact and then records the event. When it dies
 * between the two, the verdict stands on the PR and the ledger never learns it: the lane sits in
 * `review` carrying a provable `PASS` until somebody thinks to run `lane prove` by hand. Nothing in
 * the engine asked the lane's own artifact whether the event this state owes is already proven —
 * `./stale.ts` derives silence against a shell budget and reads no artifact, and `./reconcile.ts`
 * reads one but asks whether an already-recorded closure line can be trusted.
 *
 * This module answers the two offline questions that sweep needs, so both are testable without a
 * network: which event a leaf owes, and which of a lane's tasks are standing in a leaf that owes one.
 *
 * **The owed set is `./prove.ts`'s own, minus every arm a live shell also satisfies.** `claimOf` says
 * which event out of which leaf asserts a checkable artifact, and {@link OWED_EVENTS} is the arms
 * whose artifact a *finished* shell alone can produce: a `PASS` out of `review`, a `PASS` out of
 * `review:ui`. Two of `claimOf`'s arms are left out, and for one reason — each is satisfied by a
 * shell that is merely still working, so an unattended sweep standing on it would fold a lane out
 * from under a live one.
 *
 * - A `BLOCKED` out of either review cell claims `ParkUncontradicted`, which asserts that the
 *   reviewer's run reached **no** verdict. A negative like that is proven by the absence of a
 *   contradiction rather than by an artifact somebody posted, so the sweep would park every lane
 *   whose reviewer has simply not finished yet.
 * - A `DONE` out of `build`, `build:ui` or `build:mixed` claims `OpenPull`, which `./prove-verb.ts` answers `proven` for on the
 *   existence of one open PR whose body links the issue — a fact about the PR being *open*, never
 *   about the builder being *done* with it. A lane in a repair round carries exactly that PR for the
 *   whole round, so the sweep would move it to `review` while the builder is still pushing. The
 *   damage is bounded — the reviewer at head FAILs the unrepaired PR and the lane comes back — but
 *   it costs a review round and leaves the builder's own `lane report DONE` refusing against a lane
 *   that already moved, which is the park this sweep exists to prevent, not to cause.
 *
 * Reopening the `build` arm needs a claim the open PR alone does not carry — the builder's own
 * terminal, or a head the reviewer has not yet seen — and none of those is readable offline today.
 * A park is a thing a person or a driver decides, and so is calling a build finished; this records
 * the verdicts a shell already posted and died before writing.
 *
 * **The `build` leaf came back on a different question, and {@link buildingBy} is its walk.** The
 * paragraph above is about *finishing* a build, which stays off limits for the reason it gives. What
 * the spawn arm asks is whether the builder is **gone**, which turns on live board residue rather
 * than on an offline proof — so the conjunction it reads is the verb's, written once in that verb's
 * `lane recover --help` description in `./command.ts`. What lives here is the offline
 * half: which tasks to ask about ({@link buildingBy}), where a builder in each role would have left
 * its work ({@link publicationOf}), and the park those reads record ({@link DEAD_SPAWN_EVENT},
 * {@link DEAD_SPAWN_CAUSE}).
 *
 * **The queue arm asks a third question: has the merge queue already answered?** A task in
 * `ship:queued` owes no proven event, because its PR is just waiting. But the queue can finish with it
 * after the shipper's watch ended, and then all that is missing is the one read a driver pass makes.
 * {@link queuedBy} finds those tasks, {@link queuedPullOf} names the PR their own ledger recorded, and
 * {@link QUEUE_SETTLEMENTS} is the operate skill's `ship:queued` table minus the rows that spend a
 * wait or park: the sweep relays a landing or an ejection and records nothing else. A `parked`
 * answer records nothing either, but it is not a wait: per that table it owes
 * `ship disarm <pr> --site post-enqueue` now, so it is its own settlement and its own row.
