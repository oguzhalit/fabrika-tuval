/**
 * What the merge behind a ship-stage terminal closed — the one board read `lane prove` and
 * `lane reconcile` share, so the two verbs cannot disagree about one merge.
 *
 * **It reads the PR the line names, and nominates nothing.** That is not a shortcut past the
 * group's one nominator but a different question: a nominator answers "which PR is this issue's",
 * and the shipper recording the terminal already answered it — `lane report --pr` carries the URL
 * onto the very line being written, and a recorded line keeps it for `lane reconcile` to re-read.
 * Nominating here would also answer wrongly: a MERGED `Part of #N` is
 * invisible to both nomination reads, the closing edge being built from closing keywords and the
 * search half being `is:open`, so the union finds nothing for exactly the case the partial-merge
 * routing exists to catch. `nominatePulls` is unchanged — the argument against widening it stands.
 *
 * A line naming no PR falls back to the nominator at `open-or-merged`, which is the best answer
 * available without evidence on the line. Either way the judgement is {@link provenClosure}'s, not
 * `traceClosure`'s directly: a read that failed and a read that proved nothing are both `Unknown`
 * and never `Closes`, since reading either as a closing merge is the permissive fold that folds a
 * lane to a terminal over an open, still-buildable issue.
