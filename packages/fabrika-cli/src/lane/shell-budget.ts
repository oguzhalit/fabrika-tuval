/**
 * How long one shell may hold a lane before the shell driving it is judged dead.
 *
 * **There is no heartbeat, and that is the ruling rather than an omission.** The claim protocol
 * otherwise bans ending a claim on age, and two callers may read these numbers against a claim
 * marker: the `spawn-dead` unpark row, which retracts on the proof, and `lane recover --spawns`,
 * which may only record the park that row then clears. The ban that still stands whole is the one on
 * a reader **retracting**: no verb outside the unpark row ends a claim on these numbers, however it
 * reads them. A spawned shell writes
 * nothing between its claim and its terminal, so liveness is not observable at all: the only instant
 * on disk is the one the work began at. What is left to judge against is a budget — how long this
 * kind of work takes when it is going well — and silence past that budget is the death.
 *
 * The budget is therefore **per kind of work**. One horizon for the whole pipeline is the shape this
 * module replaces, and it is wrong in both directions at once: wide enough for a builder's
 * construct-check loop, it strands a dead shipper's claim for the better part of an hour; tight
 * enough for a shipper, it evicts a live builder mid-loop. Each shell state names its own number and
 * records, at the number, what shape of work the number is measuring.
 *
 * The three values are the founder's starting guesses, and they are guesses on purpose: nobody has
 * measured these loops yet, so the honest derivation is the *shape* of each shell's work, and the
 * numbers are tuned in the weekly machinery review beside the machinery-lap budget. What the shape
 * fixes and tuning may not break is the ordering — a builder writes and re-validates, a reviewer
 * reads once and records a verdict, a shipper walks a guard chain and enqueues — so
 * `build > review > ship` holds however the numbers move.
