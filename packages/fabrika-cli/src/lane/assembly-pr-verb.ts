/**
 * `lane assembly-pr` — the epic run's PR title and About section, derived and printed one at a time.
 *
 * It opens nothing. The operate skill's `gh pr create` fence stays literal and interpolates this
 * verb's stdout, which is why each `--field` prints a bare value rather than a JSON record: a shell
 * that has to reach into a document to find the title is a shell deriving the title.
 *
 * The About section's absence is an answer, not a failure: an epic with no `## Pitch` still has a
 * run to publish, and blocking that publication over prose would strand the only PR the run opens.
 * So an unpitched epic answers empty stdout with the reason on stderr, and the fence's body simply
 * carries no section. The one refusal on this field is a section the guard would refuse read back
 * through the guard's own predicates, which is a person's to reword rather than this verb's to edit.
