/**
 * The migration judgement — may this lane's `workflow.json` be replaced by the committed template?
 *
 * `lane open` places a byte-identical copy of the committed template into each lane at boot and
 * refuses to overwrite one afterwards, so a template edit reaches lanes booted after it and no lane
 * already on disk. That is safe while an edit touches the *template* only. It stops being safe the
 * moment a token→event map in code changes with it: `report.ts` is code, so a remap lands on every
 * booted lane at once and asks their frozen machines for a cell they do not have — the
 * `QUEUED`→`WIP` remap that named this.
 *
 * The fold is what makes a swap provable rather than hoped: state is `events.jsonl` replayed from
 * scratch every run, with no snapshot anywhere. So a replacement is safe exactly when the existing
 * log replays through the new machine to the same per-task leaf state it replays to through the old
 * one. This module decides that and nothing else — it reads no disk and writes none.
 *
 * The check is deliberately stricter than "the log replays": a machine that re-routes an event the
 * log already carries would replay fine and land the lane somewhere it never was, which is a
 * rewritten history rather than a migration. Drift is refused with each task named.
 *
 * What gets written is not the template's bytes but {@link graftContext}'s — see there for why the
 * lane's own `machine.context` survives the swap and why a generated machine is left alone.

/**
 * The template's shape carrying the lane's own `machine.context`, as the text to write.
 *
 * The context is the one part of a booted lane's document that is **data, not shape**: a task's
 * `maxRetries` is read from it, and a lane may carry per-task extras beside it that the fold passes
 * through to status untouched. Copying the template over a lane verbatim would reset every one of
 * them to the template's own numbers — a silent loss no fold could catch, because the log still
 * replays. So the swap replaces the states and keeps the context.
 *
 * A founder's cleared round is *not* among the things being kept here, and deliberately: a grant is
 * a `CLEARED` line in `events.jsonl`, never a context field, so it survives the swap for free — the
 * log is what the new machine replays.
 *
 * `Foreign` is the other half of the same care: a lane whose machine was *generated* rather than
 * booted (`lane emit`'s per-epic document) has no committed template to be brought up to, so it is
 * not this sweep's business at all. The document `id` is the recognition — an emitted machine is
 * `epic-<n>` and a booted one carries its template's id.
