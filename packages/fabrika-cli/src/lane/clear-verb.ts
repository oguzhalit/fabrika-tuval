/**
 * `lane clear` — the driver's seat on a spent repair budget, on both of the budgets a lane has.
 *
 * `build clear` is PR-keyed from its first line, so an epic child and a chore lane could never
 * reach it: their budget spent, they parked with a door nothing could walk. This verb is the other
 * seat, and it grants exactly what the founder's does — one recorded `<TASK>.CLEARED` round, which
 * is the only event a repair budget may come from.
 *
 * **A lane with a pull request has a second budget, and this verb grants that one too.** The lane
 * machine reads the log below; a builder reads `build verdicts`' round count on the PR. Clearing
 * only the lane's half dispatched a builder that refused without touching the branch, so the grant,
 * the `UNBLOCKED` and a whole shell went on budget nobody could spend. The founder ruled the
 * two are one act, and `./pr-grant.ts` is the PR half — it runs first, so a PR-side grant that
 * cannot be made honourably refuses with this log byte-identical rather than leaving the half-seat
 * the ruling closed. `build clear` is unchanged and stays the founder's verb for a bare PR-side
 * grant.
 *
 * **The round is derived, never typed.** `capWith` reads the task's own declared cap against the
 * rounds already cleared in its log, so one call grants one round and the next needs its own call.
 * A flag would let a caller type a number far ahead and buy several rounds in one line, which is
 * exactly the unbounded door this verb exists not to be.
 *
 * **The rationale is mandatory, because it is the whole audit.** A founder's grant is reviewable on
 * the pull request it was posted to; a driver's is reviewable on this line or nowhere — the driver
 * acts on its own recommendation and logs it.
 *
 * The round is derived outside the append's lock and recorded inside it, which is safe for the one
 * reason the grant is keyed by its round at all: two drivers deriving the same round concurrently
 * leave one `Recorded` and one `AlreadyHeld`, never two grants.
