/**
 * `lane assembly` — place, resume, or remove the worktree an epic run assembles in, and answer its
 * path.
 *
 * It is the only sanctioned way to reach `epic/<n>`'s working tree, because it is the only one that
 * cannot conscript the driver's checkout: `git worktree add` places the branch in a tree of its own
 * and leaves the invoking tree exactly where it was, where `git switch --create` moved it and kept
 * it there for the run. The branch name and the path are both derived from the epic number,
 * never taken from the caller, so "this is the run's assembly tree" is a fact rather than a claim
 * the argument asserts.
 *
 * Every mode reads the outcome back off `git worktree list` before answering. A `git worktree add`
 * that reported success and left no tree, or a `remove` that left one behind, is UNKNOWN and seats
 * on `8` — the same discipline `lane push` holds against a remote ref.
 *
 * A resume asks one more question than "does the branch exist": whether the trunk already
 * carries its content. A multi-phase epic that ships an intermediate tail lands in exactly that
 * state, and the branch is then simultaneously the sanctioned base for every remaining child and
 * guaranteed to conflict with the trunk. Containment is the one proof that re-cutting loses nothing,
 * so it is what opens that arm and nothing weaker does — and on this repository's squash trunk the
 * proof is `../io/containment.ts`'s, never ancestry alone.
