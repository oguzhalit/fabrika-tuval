/**
 * `lane refresh` — merge the trunk into an epic run's assembly branch, so the tail's review binds to
 * a head the merge queue can take.
 *
 * Nothing else in this package touches trunk after the first cut. `lane assembly` fetches `origin`
 * and cuts `epic/<n>` off `origin/HEAD` once; a resume fetches only to judge whether that branch is
 * already contained in the trunk, and merges nothing. So the branch drifts behind
 * trunk with nothing to notice, the queue ejects the tail, and `lane integrate` then reds on what is
 * really staleness. `lane push` names "fetch and re-merge" as the remedy for its exit 29 and no verb
 * performed it — this is that verb.
 *
 * A clean merge is silent: the branch moves and nothing parks. A real conflict aborts, resets
 * through `ORIG_HEAD` and **proves** the reset by re-reading HEAD, the same way `integrate`'s
 * `restore()` does — a branch that will not go back is UNKNOWN at {@link APPEND_UNKNOWN}, never the
 * clean {@link MERGE_CONFLICT} refusal, because it may still carry the merge no verdict admits.
 *
 * Two callers reach it automatically — the tail's way into review, and `lane dispatch` before it
 * cuts a child's worktree off the branch — and each is gated by its own `assemblyRefresh` arm
 * ({@link RefreshGate}). A driver typing the verb passes no gate and is never declined.
 *
 * Nothing is pushed here and no lane log is written: publishing the refreshed head is `lane push`'s
 * and recording the park is the driver's. On exit 0 the last stdout line is
 * `REFRESH-VERDICT: MERGED` or `REFRESH-VERDICT: CURRENT`, and the line above it the head.
