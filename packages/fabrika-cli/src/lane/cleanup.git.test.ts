/**
 * `lane cleanup` against real git — what a scripted spawner cannot show.
 *
 * The unit tier pins which commands run. Here git decides: whether a plain `worktree remove` takes
 * a tree that holds ignored installs, whether `rev-list --not --remotes` tells a pushed commit from
 * a local one, whether a recorded path still matches git's list when the temp directory sits
 * behind a symlinked prefix, and that git calls a tree prunable while its directory still stands.
