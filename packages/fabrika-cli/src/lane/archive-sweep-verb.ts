/**
 * `lane archive --sweep` — archive every lane in a root that both gates already clear.
 *
 * The verb existed and nothing called it in bulk, so the seats a dead lane holds against
 * `laneConcurrencyCap` only ever went down by hand: one repo reached eleven claimed seats against a
 * cap of two, nine of them corpses whose issue was closed and whose log will never replay. One lane
 * at a time is a loop nobody runs to the end, the same reason `lane migrate` and `lane stale` sweep.
 *
 * Every lane is judged on its own and a refusal is a ROW, never the end of the sweep — the single
 * fatal answer is a root that could not be listed, because an unreadable root makes the lane set
 * UNKNOWN rather than empty. The gates are {@link archiveLane}'s, and they stay BOTH gates: the
 * closed-issue one was retired from the named single-lane route only, on the argument that an
 * operator naming one bricked lane by hand has already judged it. Nothing has ruled the same for an
 * unattended walk of the whole root, and this sweep retracts no claim, so a lane it moves is a
 * strictly narrower set than `lane archive <key>` would move.
 *
 * A key that resolves to no issue is skipped and NAMED rather than fatal: the quarantine convention
 * puts `<issue>.<suffix>` directories in the root, and a root holding one unaddressable name must
 * not cost every other lane its sweep.
 *
 * A row has three outcomes, not two, because "skipped" asserts the directory is where it was: a lane
 * whose rename landed and whose destination will not read back is `moved-unverified` instead.
