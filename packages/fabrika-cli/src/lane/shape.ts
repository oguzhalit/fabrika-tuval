/**
 * Is this lane's machine the machine its issue's board state calls for?
 *
 * A lane's machine and the issue it drives are decided in two different places — the machine by
 * whichever boot verb ran (`lane open`'s committed template, `lane emit`'s generated document), the
 * issue's shape by the board — and nothing used to compare them. An epic whose lane was booted
 * before it had a plan came up on the single-task coder template, and every later diagnostic read it
 * as healthy: the fold replays fine, `lane migrate --check` grafts it cleanly and answers `current`,
 * and the only symptom is a builder backing off because the machine has no child regions to drive.
 *
 * This module is that comparison and nothing else — pure, no board read, no disk. The two inputs are
 * how the document was produced (read off its `id`) and what the board says the issue is; the reader
 * that fetches the second lives in [`expectation.ts`](expectation.ts).
 */

/**
 * What the board says the lane's issue needs.
 *
 * An epic is an issue the board types `type:epic` **or** one carrying sub-issue links: the label is
 * what a pre-plan epic has, the children are what a planned one has, and the mis-booted lane came
 * up in the window where only the first was true. `children` is the link count, so `0` is that
 * pre-plan case.
 *
 * `Child` is the mirror that guard could not reach, because both facts it reads are facts about
 * the issue itself: an epic's child carries no `type:epic` label and no children of its own, so it
 * resolved `Single` and a second lane ledger booted over work the parent's lane already owned.
 * `parent` is `null` when the board carried the edge and no number that parses.
