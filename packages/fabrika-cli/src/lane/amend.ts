/**
 * The amendment judgement — may this lane's machine be re-derived from the epic's current topology?
 *
 * The question `lane migrate` asks one axis over, under a rule that had to be new. That sweep is
 * safe exactly when the log replays through the candidate to the same per-task leaf, and it refuses
 * a candidate whose task set drops one of the lane's. A topology amendment breaks that on purpose: a
 * newly added child has no history to replay, and a not-started one may be re-sequenced into a
 * later phase, which is the whole point. So the rule here binds a narrower set — **the tasks that
 * carry history, plus the ones the lane already landed** — and leaves the rest free to move.
 *
 * A **deferral** is the one door through that history rule, and it opens only where the caller
 * names the task it is dropping. Naming it is what turns a silent drop into a recorded plan change:
 * the amendment carries the name, the bound and the reason on its own line, so the ledger still
 * accounts for every entry the dropped task recorded. See [`deferral.ts`](deferral.ts).
 *
 * Nothing here reads disk or the board: two compiled machines and the log go in, one verdict comes
 * out, and the verb writes only on the accepting one.
