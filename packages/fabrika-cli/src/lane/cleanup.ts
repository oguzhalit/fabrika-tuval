/**
 * The keep rule `lane cleanup` turns on: may this recorded worktree be taken off disk?
 *
 * Pure, and apart from the verb because the whole rule lives here. A tree goes only when every read
 * of it answered and none found something a removal would lose. Four things hold a tree: a path
 * git calls uncommitted, a commit that is neither reachable from a remote ref nor carried by one of
 * the lane's merged pull requests, a shell still in flight on it, and a directory that still stands
 * where git holds no live registration. A read that failed holds it too, because a tree nobody could
 * read is a tree nobody proved empty.
 *
 * A shell is in flight on a tree in two ways. A builder's standing `working` record names it. Or the
 * tree was handed at or after its task's standing dispatch: a dispatch stands until that shell's
 * terminal moves the task, so a tree recorded since then is the one that shell runs in, whichever
 * shell it is. A tree handed before the standing dispatch belongs to a shell that already returned.
 *
 * A local branch does not count as a home for a commit. The removal would leave the branch, so the
 * commit would survive it, but a branch only this clone holds is still work that exists nowhere
 * else, and the lane is ending.
 *
 * Three trees are never judged at all: the main working tree, which is no lane's to remove, the
 * tree the verb runs in, whose shell still stands in it, and a tree a driver recorded. A driver
 * outlives every shell it spawns, the shipper that runs this verb included, and nothing on this
 * machine says its shell has returned. A driver removes its own tree as its last act, with
 * `lane leave`.
 *
 * Git's `prunable` flag is read off a tree's `.git` file, never its directory, so it does not say
 * the directory is gone. Only a probe of the path does.
