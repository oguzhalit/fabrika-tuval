/**
 * Which recorded integrate `FAIL` may take a late exit-and-head pair, and the line that attaches it
 * — the offline half of `lane attach-integrate`.
 *
 * `build claim` reads an epic child's integrate `FAIL` off the `integrate: {exit, head}` pair on its
 * ledger line ([`integrate-failure.ts`](integrate-failure.ts)). A lane that recorded the `FAIL`
 * before the pair existed holds a pair-less line, and its task has already folded back into `build`,
 * where `lane report` refuses the pair — so no builder can take the repair the machine routed to.
 * The log is append-only, so the pair arrives on a `CORRECTED` line naming the `FAIL` by its `at`,
 * exactly as `lane reconcile` supersedes a `partial`; no recorded line changes.

 * when it was recorded, and no later `DONE` on the task has answered it. A `DONE` retires an
 * integrate `FAIL` for `build claim` (`standingIntegrateFailure`), so attaching to a retired
 * one would reopen a repair nobody owes. A line that already carries its own pair was recorded by
 * `lane report` with it, so there is nothing missing to attach. A pair an earlier attach supplied is
 * not refused: the new `CORRECTED` supersedes it, the later correction winning as for any other.
