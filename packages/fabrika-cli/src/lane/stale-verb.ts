/**
 * `lane stale` — every lane on disk, with how long since it moved, and which ones nothing is driving.
 *
 * The one verb in the group that reads across lanes rather than into one, because the question it
 * answers is a sweep: a driver (or a cron) asks which lanes are non-terminal and have gone quiet, and
 * gets a list. It writes nothing and stores nothing — the age comes off the `at` each event line
 * already carries.
 *
 * A lane that could not be read is a row, not the end of the sweep: refusing the whole answer over
 * one broken lane would hide every other lane's silence, which is the failure this verb exists to
 * end. The sweep itself refuses only when a root it was asked to scan is there and cannot be listed —
 * that leaves the lane set UNKNOWN, and an UNKNOWN lane set is never a short list.
 *
 * The sweep is **offline unless a caller asks for more**. A session limit strands a lane's state and
 * the claim marker its dead builder left on the issue, and only the first is on disk — so
 * `claims` pairs the second onto each non-terminal row. It is a reader the caller passes rather than
 * a flag this module reads, which is what keeps the default provable: with no reader there is no
 * seam to reach the board through.
