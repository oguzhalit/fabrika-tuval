/**
 * The shell in flight on each task — who the ledger says is working a task right now, and where.
 *
 * Between a dispatch and the terminal it earns, the event log records nothing, so a working
 * re-spawn and a stuck lane read the same. Two records fill that gap: the driver's `dispatched`,
 * written before it spawns, and the builder's `working`, written once its build claim wins. They
 * live in their own append-only `in-flight.jsonl` beside the log, so no fold reads them and the
 * machine moves exactly as it did without them. The file is its own rather than a kind in
 * `facts.jsonl`: a reader there refuses a kind it does not know, so a builder running a newer
 * fabrika than its driver would otherwise break the driver's `lane record` and `lane wait`.
 *
 * A record stands until the log moves its task after it: a terminal, a lap, a park, any event the
 * task's machine takes. The events that move no task — a clearance, a correction, an amendment —
 * supersede nothing. A `working` recorded before the standing `dispatched` belongs to the shell that
 * dispatch replaced, so it does not stand.
 *
 * **This is a record of who said they were working, never evidence that they still are.** Nothing
 * reads a record's age or its absence as a death: no claim release, worktree retire or reap reads
 * this file, and a shell that dies without a terminal leaves its record standing until the driver
 * records the lap or park that death is owed. `lane cleanup` reads it in the one safe direction: a
 * standing `working` record keeps the tree it names, and a standing `dispatched` keeps every tree
 * handed under its task since.
