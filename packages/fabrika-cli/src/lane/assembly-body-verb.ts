/**
 * `lane assembly-body` — the guard the epic run's PR body passes through on its way to `gh pr create`.
 *
 * It is a **relay**: the body arrives on stdin and a body that closes its epic leaves on stdout
 * unchanged — the same bytes, plus a trailing newline when the body lacked one, which is `answer`'s
 * doing and not a rewrite — so `operate`'s fence stays literal and pipes rather than deriving. A body
 * that does not close the epic is refused and nothing is printed, which is what makes the refusal
 * bite — a fence piping into `gh pr create --body-file -` opens no PR when the pipe carries nothing.
 *
 * It reads no board and takes no `--repo`, deliberately: the epic-ness of the number was already
 * established one command earlier in the same fence, by `lane assembly-pr`'s `56`, and a second
 * network read would only add an UNKNOWN to a judgement the bytes on stdin fully decide.
