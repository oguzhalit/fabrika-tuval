/**
 * `lane cleanup` — remove the worktrees a lane's shells were handed, under the keep rule in
 * [`cleanup.ts`](cleanup.ts), and name every one it did not remove.
 *
 * The set is the lane's own record ([`worktrees.ts`](worktrees.ts)) and nothing else: no tree is
 * found by listing a directory or by its name, so a tree the lane never recorded is out of reach by
 * construction. Each removal is a plain `git worktree remove` run by this process — a shell in an
 * isolated worktree is refused a typed git command against another tree, and a verb's own child
 * process is not. There is no `--force` anywhere in this file.
 *
 * The board is read only for a tree whose commits are on no remote ref, to ask whether one of the
 * lane's pull requests merged with them. Every other tree is settled by git alone.
 *
 * Nothing holds the ledger lock while trees are read or removed, because a removal deletes an
 * installed tree and can run long. The lock is taken once, at the end, for the `removed` lines.
 *
