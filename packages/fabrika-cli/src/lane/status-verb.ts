/**
 * `lane status` — one lane's derived state, folded fresh from its whole log every invocation.
 *
 * The answer is the operator's status shape: compound `stateValue` (active phase → per-task leaf,
 * future phases `"waiting"`), `status` active/done, and per-task `{retries, maxRetries, …extras}`
 * context with the tripped tasks in `errors`. A task whose latest event named a park cause carries
 * it as `context.<task>.cause` — the key `recipe unpark` seats a park against — beside the
 * evidence that park recorded: the `context.<task>.axisIssue` a `render-axis-missing` park waits on,
 * the `context.<task>.rulingIssue` a `ruling-owed` park's ruling is owed on with the `parkedAt` it
 * parked at, and the `context.<task>.founderAct` a `founder-act-owed` park waits on. A task with
 * lane classes standing carries them as `context.<task>.classes`, which is what a driver relays onto
 * the next event's `--class`.
 *
 * A `deferred` array rides beside it on a lane that has one, and it is the only part of the answer
 * not derived from the machine: a task an amendment deferred is gone from the machine, so nothing in
 * `stateValue` or `context` can say it ever existed. Without it a deferred child and a child nobody
 * ever planned read identically, and "deferred" would be indistinguishable from "done" to a reader
 * that only checks the lane reached its terminal. Absent rather than empty where the lane deferred
 * nothing, so every other lane's status is byte for byte what it always was.
 *
 * An `inFlight` object rides beside it on the same terms: each task a shell is standing on — the
 * driver's dispatch and the builder's claim token and worktree ([`in-flight.ts`](in-flight.ts)) —
 * read off a file no fold reads. It is absent where nothing stands, and a file that does not read
 * never costs the fold its answer: it is named in `inFlightUnread` instead.
