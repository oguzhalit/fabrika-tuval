/**
 * `lane open` — boot one single-issue lane from the committed coder template.
 *
 * **Byte-identical when no class stands, and seeded when one does.** The names ride the expectation
 * read's own payload ([`expectation.ts`](expectation.ts)), and [`class-seed.ts`](class-seed.ts)
 * writes them into the bytes placed and carries the why. An off-set spelling refuses on
 * {@link CLASS_UNRECOGNISED} before placement.
 *
 * The boot an operator used to do by hand as `mkdir -p && cp`, as a verb
 * that refuses instead of overwriting: an existing lane dir is a loud {@link LANE_EXISTS}, because
 * resuming needs no boot and a silent overwrite would corrupt a live fold.
 *
 * The coder template has one task, so an epic has no machine here at all — booting one anyway is
 * the wrong-template lane, which reads healthy to every later diagnostic. So an issue-keyed boot
 * asks the board what the issue is *before* it writes, and refuses an epic with
 * {@link SHAPE_MISMATCH}. A chore lane drives no issue and is never asked.
 *
 * **Both halves of "epic" are asked for, and the unplanned half is the one the incident needed.** An
 * epic that has not been planned carries no sub-issue links, so a refusal keyed on children alone
 * could not fire in the pre-plan window the incident came from; the `type:epic` label is what covers
 * it. The refusal says which case it is, because their remedies differ: plan the epic, or emit its
 * machine.
 *
 * **The parent edge is asked for too, and it is the mirror those two facts cannot see.** An epic's
 * child carries neither of them, so it booted a coder-template ledger of its own while the parent's
 * lane held the same number as a task — two ledgers over one piece of work, reconciled by
 * nothing. That refusal is {@link LANE_IS_CHILD}, and a child never gets a ledger whatever else is
 * true. Epic wins the precedence, so a sub-epic still routes to `lane emit`.
 *
 * **The edge is where that question starts, not where it is answered.** The refusal used to assert
 * off the edge alone that the parent's lane already carried the child as a task, which is false for
 * a follow-up linked under a running epic — its remedy sent the driver to a lane with no cell for
 * the issue, and no operator could pick it up at all. So the parent lane's own task set is
 * read first ([`child-membership.ts`](child-membership.ts)) and the route the refusal names comes
 * off that: drive the parent lane, amend it first, or — when the task set did not read — read it
 * before choosing either.
 *
 * **A lane the board says already ran is refused too, with {@link PRIOR_LANE}.** The ledger is a
 * lane's whole state and `.fabrika/` is gitignored, so removing the directory and booting again
 * restores a spent repair budget and leaves no record that a round was granted — the laundering this
 * refusal exists to stop, and the reason a spent budget comes back only through a recorded
 * clearance. The fact is a caller-passed [`prior-lane.ts`](prior-lane.ts) read, asked only when the
 * directory is absent, so an existing lane still answers {@link LANE_EXISTS} and a driver's tolerated
 * resume is unchanged.
 *
 * **That refusal has one arm, and the board opens it: `--from-board`.** A prior ledger written on
 * another operator's machine is unreachable forever, so the refusal used to leave finished, verified
 * work with no verb that moved it — and the only moves left were the two `operate` forbids. Under
 * the flag the boot is admitted by [`board-seat.ts`](board-seat.ts): exactly one open pull request,
 * every namespace its head derives answered, on `lane prove`'s own fold. The placed document then
 * declares the repair budget **spent**, because the board proves the work is verified and proves
 * nothing at all about how many rounds the prior lane burned — so this boot mints none, and the
 * adoption is recorded on the issue before anything lands on disk. Everything the board does not
 * prove refuses at {@link PRIOR_LANE} exactly as it did.
 *
 * The lane's origin — where it came from — is written as its first fact ([`facts.ts`](facts.ts))
 * right after the machine is placed, a driver pick unless `--origin` says otherwise.
 *
 * The repo's declared `laneConcurrencyCap` is the last gate before the write, and an issue lane's
 * alone — see [`concurrency.ts`](concurrency.ts) for what counts as a held seat: a lane under this
 * root whose log folds to `active` AND whose issue carries a live `lane claim`, plus every lane no
 * read can account for. An active lane nobody claims is idle and takes no seat.
