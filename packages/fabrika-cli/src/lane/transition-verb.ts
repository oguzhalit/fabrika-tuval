/**
 * `lane transition` — record one operator event, or refuse it with the log left byte-identical.
 *
 * The order is the contract: validate against the folded state FIRST, append ONLY an event the
 * machine accepts. An invalid event — no cell in the current state, outside the six, wrong phase,
 * finished workflow — never reaches the append, so the refusal leaves `events.jsonl` untouched.
 * An append that fails is {@link APPEND_UNKNOWN}, never reported as recorded.
 *
 * **The append is proof-gated, exactly as `lane report`'s is.** A driver's record is a self-report
 * like a shell's token, so between the machine's acceptance and the append this verb runs the same
 * read `lane prove` runs and refuses on the prover's own code with the log untouched.
 * The proof used to sit beside the verb as a command a driver was told to run first, which a
 * chained `lane prove …; lane transition …` skipped without failing anywhere. The prover is a
 * parameter so this verb's unit tier stays offline; the CLI hands it `runProve`.
 *
 * The prover's own payloads ride the appended line here as they do on the shell's path, `diagnosis`
 * among them: an investigation's build `DONE` proven off a diagnosis comment rather than a pull
 * request takes the machine's `done:diagnosis` arm from this door too, so which verb recorded the
 * terminal cannot change which terminal the lane reaches.
 *
 * The proof is read-only over the artifacts and runs BEFORE the lock; the authoritative
 * load → fold → validate → append pass runs inside it ([`append-lock.ts`](append-lock.ts)), so a
 * writer cannot validate against bytes another is about to move under it. Lock-budget exhaustion
 * refuses {@link CONCURRENT_WRITE} — retry this same event — never an ordinary machine-refusal code.
