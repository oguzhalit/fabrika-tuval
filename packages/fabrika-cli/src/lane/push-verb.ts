/**
 * `lane push` — publish an epic run's assembly branch, then **independently confirm the remote ref
 * moved**.
 *
 * `build push` cannot serve this branch: it proves the checked-out branch carries a build claim's
 * nonce, and the assembly branch is owned by no spawned shell. The alternative was a bare
 * `git push` in the driver's own hands, which cannot report whether the ref landed — the exact hole
 * every other publishing verb closed. So the assembly step gets a verb of its own with the
 * same evidence discipline: `git ls-remote` asks the remote directly and the caller compares.
 *
 * The branch name is derived from the epic number through {@link epicBranch}, never taken from the
 * caller, and the run's lane must be on disk — together that makes "this is the run's assembly
 * branch" a fact read off the ledger rather than a claim the argument asserts.
 *
 * There is no force flag. The assembly branch only ever grows, one merge per landed child, so a
 * non-fast-forward push is always a mistake and the flag that would let one through does not exist.
 *
 * The push target is derived the same way: `HEAD:refs/heads/epic/<n>`, spelled out rather than read
 * off the branch's recorded upstream. Reading it there aimed every push in an epic run at
 * `refs/heads/main`, which only branch protection refused.
 *
 * It is also the run's fail-closed isolation gate. Every assembly publication passes through here,
 * so this is where "the assembly seat never stands in the main working tree" is proven rather than
 * assumed: a push from the primary checkout is refused on `33` before anything is fetched, read back
 * or sent.
