/**
 * `lane reconcile` — find every lane whose recorded merge closure disagrees with the board, and
 * append the line that corrects it.
 *
 * The third verb in the group that reads across lanes rather than into one, and for the same reason
 * the other two do: the question is a sweep. The `partial` payload only ever rode lines
 * written after it existed, so the population is every lane shipped before it — nobody has counted
 * them and no read into one lane could.
 *
 * It is not `lane migrate`'s business even though the shapes rhyme. That sweep answers whether a
 * lane's machine is the committed template and writes `workflow.json` **only where the swap is
 * provably inert**, which is the guarantee that sweep rests on; appending an event is the opposite
 * of inert. Two questions, two writes, two verbs.
 *
 * Every lane is judged on its own — an unreadable one is a row, never the end of the sweep — and the
 * board is asked only about a lane whose log already nominates a correctable line: one PR read each,
 * serial.
 *
 * **A lane is read once, not once per sweep.** Whichever way the board answers, the answer is
 * appended as a correction — `partial: true` on a merge that left its issue open, `partial: false` on
 * one that closed it — so the line carries its own answer afterwards and `findMisroute` stops
 * nominating it. The confirming line moves no task; the ship stage now writes `false`
 * too, so only lanes shipped before that stop nominating one at a time. Budget a sweep as one read
 * per never-confirmed lane: the first pass over a backlog is still hundreds, every pass after it is
 * the lanes that shipped since. `--check` withholds the append, so it buys nothing for the next
 * sweep and costs the same reads twice.
