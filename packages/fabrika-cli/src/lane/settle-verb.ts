/**
 * `lane settle` — record the terminal the board's own closure proves, on a lane whose own flow never
 * reached one.
 *
 * Two shapes of stranded ledger, one verb. Lane 5983 sat parked at `blocked` while its issue closed
 * `not_planned`, with no artifact owed and no legal event to end it. The hand-shipped lanes sit in
 * `build` or `review` while their issue closed `completed` over a merged PR the lane's own flow never
 * recorded. In both, `DONE` claims an open PR that is not there, `BLOCKED` only parks, and
 * `UNBLOCKED` resumes work that is already over — so the only remedy was `rm -rf` on the lane
 * directory, which erases an append-only history instead of recording an outcome. This verb appends
 * one line instead, and moves nothing on disk.
 *
 * **The board read is the whole entitlement**, because both terminals are proven from nothing on
 * disk. `not_planned`/`duplicate` records `CANCELLED`; `completed` PLUS at least one merged pull
 * request linking the issue records `LANDED`, carrying those pull requests and their merge commit as
 * the line's evidence. An open issue refuses at {@link ISSUE_LIVE}. A `completed` close with no
 * merged linking PR is UNKNOWN, not a landing — the board says somebody called it done and names
 * nothing that did it, so what discharged the lane is genuinely unread.
 *
 * **`--landed-by <pr>` supplies the link that read lacks, and nothing else.** Plenty of merged work
 * cites one issue in its body and closes another by hand, which leaves a landing that really
 * happened and no body naming it. The flag names the merge; the board still has to say that pull
 * request merged, so an unmerged one refuses at {@link PROOF_IN_FLIGHT} and an absent one at
 * {@link PROOF_ABSENT}, both with the log unappended. The line then records `assertedBy`, so a later
 * reader tells an asserted link from a body-proven one without re-reading anything.
 *
 * **A live claim is protected.** A lane another session is driving is not one to end underneath it,
 * so an authorized lane-claim marker refuses unless the caller names that very token. An unreadable
 * claim thread is UNKNOWN, never "unclaimed".
 *
 * The gate order is a cost decision, the shape `lane archive` set: everything local runs first — the
 * load, the fold, and whether this lane already carries a terminal — so a lane with nothing to settle
 * costs no board read, and the pull requests are read only on the arm that needs them.
 *
 * `DONE`'s own proof semantics are untouched: this appends neither `DONE` nor any operator event, so
 * a lane whose own flow really does reach its ship stage still folds through the machine it always
 * did, and a terminal recorded here says by name that the pipeline did not drive it.
