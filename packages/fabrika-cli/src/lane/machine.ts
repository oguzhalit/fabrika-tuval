/**
 * The lane compiler — one `workflow.json` machine document in, one flat tea Transitions machine
 * per task out, everything a nested state library carried reduced to data.
 *
 * Structural recognitions replace every name-driven mechanism, and **four guard spellings are
 * read**: a `guard`/`actions` string is otherwise inert data.
 *
 *   - An **array on an event** means guarded: `[taken-when-the-guard-holds, else-fallthrough]`, and
 *     the fallthrough target, when final, is the task's error final (`frozen`, `tripped`) — except
 *     under the three routing spellings below, whose fallthrough is the ordinary path and carries no
 *     error. The first arm past any leading routes picks the guard, and only five kinds exist.
 *     {@link LAP_GUARD} is one of the two that may repeat and the one that comes first: zero or more
 *     `lap:<cause>` arms may precede the budget pair on a {@link MACHINERY_EVENT}, each naming the
 *     target that lap's own cause folds to. It routes and nothing else — the lap is still spent, and
 *     a cause no arm names still loops on the budget pair — which is what lets one `LAP` cell send a
 *     ship-cell conflict to `build` while the machinery that only moved a head still self-targets.
 *     `class:<name>` reads the lane class the event carried (see {@link TaskState}) and spends
 *     nothing: it picks which shell serves the round, and picking is not repairing. It is read two
 *     ways, told apart by what follows it: above a single fallthrough the class arms ARE the cell —
 *     one arm or several, the first whose class stands taken — and
 *     leading a budget pair it is a ROUTE like `lap:<cause>` — the budget still decides whether the
 *     loop is taken, the class only decides which cell it re-enters. That second reading is what
 *     sends a rendered child's FAIL back to `build:ui` while a spent one still parks.
 *     {@link PARTIAL_GUARD} reads whether the merge this event reports closed its issue, and spends
 *     nothing either: a `Part of #N` merge is real work landing, so the lane goes round again rather
 *     than folding to a terminal over an issue the board still calls buildable.
 *     {@link DIAGNOSIS_GUARD} reads whether the `DONE` this event reports was proven off a diagnosis
 *     comment instead of a pull request, and spends nothing either: an investigation opens no PR, so
 *     the review its `DONE` used to reach could never be walked. Every
 *     other spelling is the budget guard, one inline counter comparison in the compiled cell, and
 *     **which counter it spends is the event's own polarity**: `FAIL` is a repair round and spends
 *     `retries`, {@link MACHINERY_EVENT} is the pipeline's own machinery failing and spends `laps`,
 *     every other event is a wait and spends `waits`. A queue dwell must not eat the
 *     budget a later repair draws on, and neither must a child collision at integrate; reading that
 *     off the event keeps it structural — no guard NAME is consulted beyond the four routing
 *     spellings, and a fifth spelled with their namespace is refused at compile rather than read as
 *     the budget guard, which is what closes the set.
 *   - A transition **targeting a `history` node** resumes the state the task left, carried as the
 *     `was` field in {@link TaskState} — history-state semantics as data, no pseudo-state.
 *   - A phase's **`onDone` pair** `[{target, guard}, {target}]` names the two workflow terminals
 *     structurally: the last phase's guarded target is the complete terminal, the fallthrough is
 *     the tripped one.
 *   - A **`final` carrying an `on`** is a park rather than an end: it stays in `finals`, so its
 *     phase still folds and its trip still reads, and the door out stays walkable — how `frozen`
 *     takes an `UNBLOCKED` without leaving either set.
 *
 * Compilation is total over its result type: a document that does not fit comes back as
 * {@link Malformed} with every defect named, never as a machine that half-works.
 *
 * One cell is the compiler's rather than the document's: {@link CLEARED_EVENT}, injected into every
 * state, which raises the retry budget and moves nothing. A document that declares it is
 * still a defect — the budget is a fold over recorded events, so a grant is a line in
 * `events.jsonl`, never a field the compiler reads out of mutable context.
