/**
 * The stall derivation — a lane's folded state plus the age of its last event, judged.
 *
 * The ledger records state, not liveness: when the shell driving a lane dies, the last recorded
 * state stays on disk and every reader still sees an active lane. Nothing new is stored to
 * fix that. Every event line already carries an ISO `at`, so "how long since this lane moved" is
 * already on disk, and this module is the reading of it.
 *
 * The judgement turns on one question — **should something be driving this lane right now?** Three
 * dispositions answer it and only one is judged against the clock:
 *
 *   - A lane whose fold is `done` has no driver by design.
 *   - A lane where no task can be driven and at least one sits in a **park** — `blocked` or a
 *     `human:*` state — is waiting on a person, and waiting is what a park is for. It may sit for
 *     days without that being a defect.
 *   - Everything else is a lane something is supposed to be doing: a task in a state that routes to
 *     a shell (`lane brief`'s own routing, so the two agree by construction), or a `queued` task
 *     nobody has dispatched. Silence there is the defect.
 *
 * How long that silence may run is **not** one number for the pipeline: it is the budget of the work
 * actually being done, off `./shell-budget.ts`, so the same sweep judges a shipper and a builder on
 * their own horizons.
