/**
 * The archive judgement — is this lane's log one no sweep can ever judge?
 *
 * The entitlement `lane archive` needs before it moves a directory, the closed-issue gate that used
 * to stand beside it having been retired; {@link judgeRetriage} below is the one other, taken only
 * under `--retriaged`. This module reads no disk and writes none; the verb's remaining board work is
 * retracting the lane claim, not judging the log.
 *
 * The judgement is [`migrate.ts`](migrate.ts)'s, deliberately and by call rather than by
 * re-derivation: the lanes an archive is for are exactly the ones `lane migrate` already refuses as
 * `Unreplayable`, so if the two ever answered differently, the sweep would keep reporting a lane the
 * archive had already taken out of scope, or take one out that the sweep still judges fine.
 *
 * The lane's own machine is folded first, and that ordering is the one thing this adds. A generated
 * epic machine has no committed template to be a candidate ({@link graftContext} answers `Foreign`),
 * so that one fold is the whole judgement: a log it folds `Replays`, because no second machine
 * exists to be unknown about, and one it refuses is `Unreplayable` through `current`. Asking for a
 * candidate first would answer neither.

/**
 * The re-triage judgement — did this lane end `diagnosed`, with no pull request anywhere in its log?
 *
 * The second thing that entitles `lane archive` to move a lane, and a narrow one. A builder's no-PR
 * finish is final, so once triage rewrites the issue nothing can boot a fresh lane over the ledger
 * standing in the key. Only the lane's own machine is folded: the question is which state this lane
 * is in, not whether a sweep can judge it. A log any line of which names a pull request is refused
 * whatever it folds to, so moving a ledger aside is never how a lane's published work goes unread.
 *
 * A line's `pr` is optional evidence — `lane transition` never writes one — so its absence proves
 * nothing, and the fold is read for spend as well: a retry or a cleared round on any task, a review
 * verdict or a `CLEARED` line, or a `DONE` not proven off a diagnosis (which only a delivered pull
 * request earns). Any of them is `Spent`, because a fresh lane boots at zero retries and moving this
 * ledger aside would hand back a repair budget no granted round restored.
