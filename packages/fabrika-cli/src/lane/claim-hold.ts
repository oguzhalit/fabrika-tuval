/**
 * Whether a lane on disk is one somebody is actually driving — the board read the concurrency cap

 *
 * A reader a caller passes rather than a seam [`concurrency.ts`](concurrency.ts) reaches through on
 * its own, which is what keeps the counting testable with no board at all — the shape `lane open`'s
 * [`expectation.ts`](expectation.ts) reader established.
 *
 * `Unknown` is why this is a sum and not a boolean: an unreadable comment thread or ACL leaves the
 * question unanswered, and reading that as "unclaimed" would free a seat on a failed read, which is
 * the permissive arm the cap exists to refuse.
