/**
 * `lane brief` — the spawn prompt for one task's current leaf state, printed rather than composed.
 *
 * Every value is derived: the state from the fold, the shell from the format's routing table, the
 * issue and PR from the board, the rules from the format's own byte-fixed text. Nothing here is
 * authored per run, which is the point — a prompt a driver writes by hand is a prompt two drivers
 * write differently, and the "URLs, never restatements" rule is then enforced by nothing but care.
 *
 * The brief is a dispatch artifact, consumed in-session and never posted, so it is not leak-scanned.
 * It carries no content — only URLs the board already published, the epic branch the emitter's own
 * shape names, and the two local paths a spawned shell cannot derive: this driver's lanes root,
 * resolved absolute here because the shell would resolve a relative one against its own worktree,
 * and the fabrika entrypoint the shell runs its verbs through, resolved off this running copy so a
 * repo that installs fabrika is not handed the developing repo's in-tree path.
 *
 * An epic lane's children are the one place where no PR is resolved at all: one run is one branch and
 * one PR, so a child builds in a worktree and its review judges a commit range, while the tail task
 * briefs that single PR under the same refusals a single-issue lane has always used. That
 * range is resolved here, off this tree, through the same read `lane prove` stands its proof on
 * (`./range.ts`) — the two verbs cannot name different ranges for one child, and a range the tree
 * cannot pin refuses the dispatch instead of printing one that resolves to nothing.
 *
 * A brief standing on that branch is also checked against it: the entrypoint is repo-relative in a
 * checkout, so it resolves inside the shell's worktree, and a branch cut before a lane verb landed
 * hands the shell a CLI that cannot execute the contract this brief states. `./briefed-verbs.ts`
 * reads the branch's own tree, and a missing verb refuses at {@link BRIEFED_VERB_ABSENT}.
 *
 * A build or review brief also names the comments a control-plane account left on the issue that no
 * ruling marker records, read through the scan `review criteria` and `lane prove` answer from. That
 * read never refuses a dispatch: a failure rides in the brief as `unknown`.
