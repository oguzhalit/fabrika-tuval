/**
 * `lane recover` — find every lane whose own artifact already proves the event its ledger is
 * missing, and record it.
 *
 * A reviewer posts its SHA-bound verdict on the PR and then runs `lane report`. A shell killed
 * between the two leaves the verdict standing and the ledger silent, and nothing downstream can see
 * it: one lane sat in `review` for 448 minutes carrying a head-bound `review-code: PASS` the whole
 * time, and its recovery — `lane prove <lane> PASS`, then `lane transition <lane> PASS` — was two
 * commands and no judgement. This is that recovery as a sweep. Every provider-killed reviewer or
 * shipper lands in the same state, so the cost scales with how often shells die rather than with how
 * hard lanes are.
 *
 * **Where it lives is a decision, not an accident.** The symptom is already detected in the
 * `heal-ci` group, whose scheduled sweep saw that same stranded PR and routed it to `ship` on the PR
 * itself while the ledger stayed three events short — but that group's own law is that it summons
 * nobody and writes no ledger (`heal-ci/SKILL.md` §2, anchor `NEVER-DISPATCH`), and its lane arm is a
 * total lookup from a stall class to a lane token. An arm there that appended would need that law
 * amended. So the write lives in the `lane` group beside the other cross-lane sweeps, where appending
 * to a ledger is already what the group does: `lane stale` derives silence against a shell budget and
 * reads no artifact, `lane reconcile` reads an artifact and corrects an already-recorded line, and
 * this reads an artifact and records a line nobody wrote.
 *
 * **It adds no trust and no proof path.** Every append is an existing verb's whole path, unchanged:
 * the proven and spawn arms append through `lane transition`, and the queue arm through `lane
 * report` — the same machine validation, the same proof gate and the same ledger lock a driver's own
 * record goes through. What moves is only who runs them: a sweep rather than a person who happened
 * to think of it.
 *
 * **The proven arm records on the literal `proven` and on nothing else.** Its bar is `lane prove`'s
 * read, unchanged. `not-required` and every refusal code leave the lane exactly where it was and land
 * as their own row, so an unreadable board is a row to re-run rather than a lane moved on a read
 * nobody made.
 *
 * **And the proven arm asks only about the events a finished shell alone can have earned.** A `PASS`
 * out of either review cell is its whole owed set; the `BLOCKED` a reviewer's park claims and the
 * `DONE` a builder's open PR claims are both out of scope, because a shell that is merely still
 * working satisfies each of them too. `./recover.ts` carries the argument for both arms.
 *
 * **`--spawns` adds the second arm: the builder that died leaving nothing behind at all.** The arm
 * above recovers a shell that finished and could not say so; this one parks a lane whose shell never
 * finished and never will. Lane 7778 read `issue: build` for five days holding a seat against the
 * concurrency cap, because the only thing that records `BLOCKED --cause spawn-dead` was a driver
 * re-reading the lane by hand. **The conjunction it reads, and what each answer short of it means,
 * is owned by `lane recover --help`** in `./command.ts`. Repeating it here left five copies
 * disagreeing about the population when they landed.
 *
 * The implementation also holds two local invariants:
 *
 * - **Every conjunct is a read actually made, and every row's reason names the read it stands on.**
 *   The population spans two build leaves and three lane roles, so the third conjunct is picked off
 *   `./recover.ts`'s {@link publicationOf} rather than off the recorded-event claim table — see that
 *   function for what borrowing the other table cost.
 * - **It retracts nothing, and it is not the end of the chain.** Ending a claim stays the
 *   `spawn-dead` unpark row's act, on the same budget proof through the same `../build/dead-claim.ts`
 *   read — and that row is keyed on exactly the park this arm writes, so the claim does end, one
 *   verb later, with no person in between. The ruling below authorizes the sweep to record that park.
 *
 * It is off unless a caller hands in the reads, because it costs board reads per building lane and
 * because recording a **park** is a different act from recording the verdict a finished shell earned.
 *
 * **The queue arm settles a lane whose PR left the merge queue after the shipper stopped watching.**
 * It is the operate skill's `ship:queued` driver pass, run for every queued lane at once: the same
 * `ship reconcile <pr> --polls 1` read, with its answer relayed through `lane report`'s own path —
 * `landed` records `LANDED` and `ejected` records `EJECTED`, the `DONE` and `FAIL` out of
 * `ship:queued` that only `lane report` maps. `unresolved`, `parked` and an unreadable read record
 * nothing, so the sweep never spends a wait. `parked` is not a wait, though: it lands as a
 * `disarm-owed` row naming the `ship disarm <pr> --site post-enqueue` the driver owes now, because
 * a live arm left standing enqueues ungated later. It is on by default, unlike `--spawns`, because what it
 * records is an answer and never a park, and it reads only the lanes standing in `ship:queued`, which
 * is a handful and not the whole building population.
 *
 * **A `recovered` or `settled` row reports where the append says the lane landed, not where this
 * sweep predicted it would.** The prediction is taken off a fold nothing holds a lock over, and the
 * appending verb re-reads and re-folds the log inside the ledger lock before it applies anything, so
 * a writer landing between the two makes them disagree — and the row a driver reads and acts on would
 * name a state the lane is not in, on an exit-0 sweep. A `--check` row keeps the prediction, which is
 * the only ground a run that appends nothing has.
 *
 * Each recoverable lane costs two board reads rather than one: this sweep asks the proof what the
 * answer is, and `lane transition` asks it again under its own gate before it appends. That second
 * read is the gate refusing to take this sweep's word for it, which is the property worth the read —
 * and it is paid only by a lane that is actually recoverable, which is a killed shell's lane and not
 * a busy one. A queued task costs its one `ship reconcile` read, plus `lane report`'s own proof read
 * of the `DONE` when that answer is `landed`. `--check` pays the first read alone and appends nothing.
