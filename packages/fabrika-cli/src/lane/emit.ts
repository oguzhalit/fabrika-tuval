/**
 * The pure epic-machine emitter — one epic body plus its child links in, one `workflow.json` text
 * out, byte-deterministic.
 *
 * **No second grammar and no second cycle walk.** The topology is read through
 * `ledger/topology-doc.ts`'s `readDeclared`, which parses with the shipped `build/dependencies.ts`
 * parser — the same reader `build check --surface plan` validates with, while `build eligible` gates
 * on the native `blocked_by` graph instead — restricts what it read to the epic's live children, and
 * carries the `dropForeign` axis `ledger retopology` reads too; the cycle check is that same
 * module's `findCycle` over the union graph (declared `requires` edges
 * plus the edges the phase order implies). What this module adds is only the machine rendering:
 * one region per child, phases sequenced by `onDone`, parallel within a phase, and one epic tail
 * phase after the last of them.
 *
 * **One epic run is one branch and one PR**. A child's region is the local loop only —
 * `queued → build → review → integrate`, the integrate step merging the child's range into the epic
 * branch — and the merge to `main` lives once, in the tail phase's single epic-level region
 * (`review → ship → shipped`, plus the `build` repair cell a failed tail review retries into and the
 * `review:ui` cell a rendered run's tail routes through on its way to `ship`). The
 * tail is a *phase* rather than a bare state because `machine.ts` reads the workflow's two terminals
 * off the last phase's `onDone` pair; shaped this way the compiler needs no change at all.
 *
 * Determinism is by construction: phases ascend, children within a phase ascend, every object's
 * keys are inserted in one fixed order, and the serialization is a single `JSON.stringify` — the
 * same body bytes and the same child links (each child's number, state and close reason) can only
 * produce the same machine bytes. A child's state is part of the input: a closed child boots its
 * region in a final state, so re-emitting a partly-built epic yields a machine that can still
 * terminate.
 *
 * The machinery lap axis rides one boolean, off by default (`machineryLaps.onEmit`): on, each task
 * seeds a lap counter and every state a machinery failure can strike takes a `LAP` arm — the
 * collision and queue cells, and every state that dispatches a shell (see {@link lapArm}); off,
 * every byte is what it was before the axis existed. The machine is fixed at emission, so the flag
 * reaches no lane already on disk.
 *
 * The class axis rides each child's own `classes`, off the `sub_issues` payload's labels: a classed
 * child seeds `context.<task>.classes` and takes the class-guarded arms, an unclassed one is the
 * bytes it always was ([`class-seed.ts`](class-seed.ts) carries why that seed matters). Same
 * fixed-at-emission rule — a class stamped after the emit reaches this machine only through an
 * event.

 * One child's region — the local loop, namespaced to the child's task id.

 * because there is no per-child PR to ship or to gate.
 *
 * `integrate` is the merge of the reviewed range into the epic branch, and it is a *state* so that a
 * collision between two children resolves inside the run: its `FAIL` — a textual conflict, or a
 * failed post-merge check, which is the semantic collision — re-enters the construction cell under
 * the same guarded-FAIL retry array `review` uses, and exhausts into `human:budget-spent` — a park with an
 * `UNBLOCKED` door back to the state it left, spent retries held. No route from it reaches a
 * merge queue, and none reaches `landed` without passing back through `review`: post-resolution
 * content is not what the range verdict judged, so the verdict is re-proven before the landing
 * rather than after it.
 *
 * Its `WIP` is the door that keeps that second half true when the verb resolves the collision
 * itself. `lane integrate`'s replay puts a colliding child's commits down on the assembly tip, so
 * the graded range moves and a verdict bound to the old range no longer describes what would land —
 * the run says as much in `reReview: "required"`. Without an arm out of `integrate` the only move
 * toward progress was the `DONE` into `landed`, which ends the child on content no reviewer read.
 *
 * That arm is a guarded array like `ship:queued`'s, not the plain target it was first written as: a
 * replay is machinery working rather than the child failing, so it spends `waits` and never a repair
 * round, which is the whole of `budget: "unspent"`. Spending nothing at all is the shape that was
 * wrong — `integrate --WIP--> review --PASS--> integrate` is a closed cycle, and a plain target sits
 * in no wait park, so nothing counted its turns. Its spent-budget fallthrough is
 * `human:replay-stall` rather than `human:budget-spent` because a replay that will not settle is a
 * collision between two children a person reads, not a child that failed its review. Its own row in
 * `report.ts`'s `STRUCTURAL_PARK_CAUSES` is what keeps it a door rather than a dead end: a `WIP`
 * may carry no `--cause`, so without one the leaf folds causeless, `routeForCause` reads `founder`
 * and `recipe unpark` refuses it forever — a machinery failure spending a person, which is the whole
 * defect this region was rewritten to remove.
 *
 * `frozen` survives as the boot state {@link initialFor} seats an abandoned child in, and nothing
 * transitions into it any more: a spent repair budget lands on `human:budget-spent` instead, which
 * is the SAME shape — a `final` carrying an `UNBLOCKED` door, so the phase folds and the lane trips
 * loud — under a name `recipe/parks.ts` can see. `isPark` matches `blocked` and `human:*` and
 * matched `frozen` never, so a child at its cap parked where every recipe answered `NotParked`.
 *
 * A `ui`-classed child carries one more state — `build:ui` — and the guarded `queued.WIP` arm into
 * it, so its first construction pass runs in the rendered shell. Without that pair the class seed
 * reached an emitted child and turned nothing, the half of this axis a folded report named from the
 * other end. Its repair rounds run there too: both FAIL arms are {@link repairArm}, which leads the
 * retry pair with the class route, so a rendered child's every round is served by the rendered
 * shell and a spent one still parks at `human:budget-spent`. A mixed child — `ui` beside a text
 * class — carries `build:mixed` above it on the same arms ({@link classedBuilds}). The template's `review:ui` cell has no
 * counterpart here, for the reason {@link UI_CLASS} carries — a child's rendered review is the
 * tail's, and the class on these arms picks the BUILDER, never a reviewer.

/**
 * The epic's own region — the tail phase's single task: review the one PR, then merge it once, with
 * one `build` cell behind the review for the repair a failed tail owes.
 *
 * `ship` carries the same guarded FAIL, because a PR can be re-reviewed at a rewritten head while
 * the lane sits there and a park clear is exactly that path. Its retry arm stays `review`: a shipper
 * fails on the PR's own mergeability, which the next verdict over the same head answers.
 *
 * `ship:queued` is the tail's wait cell: the tail is the one place an epic run meets a
 * merge queue, so it is the one region that needs it — a child region has no `ship` and reaches no
 * queue at all. The `WIP` out of it is a guarded array like the FAIL above, but it spends `waits`
 * rather than `retries`, so a queue dwell cannot eat the epic review's repair rounds. Its spent-
 * budget fallthrough is `human:queue-stall` and not `human:cp-approval` because a `WIP` carries no
 * park cause, and `recipe/parks.ts`'s §CP row keys on the approval wait's cause — a stall landing
 * there would seat on no row at all. Its own leaf is what seats it on the `queue-moved` recipe.
 *
 * `review` FAIL is a two-arm guarded array so the fallthrough final is an *error* final by the
 * compiler's own structural read; a plain target would leave a failed epic review folding to
 * `complete`. Its retry arm is `build` — the tail's own repair cell, carrying the child region's two
 * edges — because the facts a tail review fails on (a trunk conflict against a moved `main`, a head
 * with no CI) are a builder's to fix and no reviewer can change them: aimed back at `review` the arm
 * re-dispatched the shell that had just produced the verdict, spent the round and reached the park
 * anyway (the 2026-08-20 amendment to the epic-machine decision record). The fallthrough is the same `human:budget-spent` a
 * child's is: an epic review that spent its budget is a park its driver resumes, not the end of the
 * run, and one leaf for one fact means one route to read it by.
 *
 * `human:cp-approval` carries the coder template's guarded `FAIL` pair, so `recipe unpark` can send a
 * head `heal-ci` classes `logic` red out of the park into repair. It retries into `build`, not
 * `review`, for the reason `review`'s does: a red head is a builder's to fix.
 *
 * Its `WIP` is the refreshed-head route: a head moved while the tail waits on its approval has no
 * binding verdict, so the round it owes is walked from `review` and returns to this park only by
 * `review → ship → BLOCKED`. It is a plain target because a re-review is neither a repair round nor
 * a queue dwell, and it is not `UNBLOCKED` because nothing was approved.
 *
 * `review:ui` is the tail's second review cell, and the tail is the ONE region of this machine that
 * carries it. Every child hands its rendered namespace on unconditionally, so the whole run's
 * `review-ui` debt arrives here; with no cell to route into, `prove.ts` left the tail owing the set
 * at `review`, refused every `PASS` at exit 23, and the lane could neither ship nor park honestly —
 * `review` is an active state, so no stale sweep ever saw it. The cell is emitted unconditionally
 * rather than on a class, because the tail's context seeds none: the tail is emitted before any
 * child has classed anything, and the class reaches it only as the `classes` a reviewer relays on
 * `lane report --class ui`. A tail whose run renders nothing never raises the guard, walks
 * `review → ship` on the bytes it always walked, and derives no namespace for the cell to owe.
 *
 * Its `FAIL` retries into `build` — the tail's one repair cell — and not into a `build:ui` of its
 * own. A tail repair round is briefed on the assembly branch beside the run's PR, and
 * `wire/lane-brief.ts` admits that pair for `build` alone; a rendered repair is the mixed builder's
 * per-file law over that same branch, which needs no second cell here.
