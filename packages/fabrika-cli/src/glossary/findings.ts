 * always be set together — and a run that reports both a dead citation and "the corpus was never
 * read" contradicts itself. `detail` is the whole finding line, worded by whoever knows why the
 * corpus went unread (unreadable directory, or a repo that declares it keeps none).
 *
 * `Empty` exists so `Unverified` can never carry a citation set of zero: with nothing cited, why the
 * corpus went unread is moot, and reporting it hands a repo that keeps no corpus and cites nothing a
 * defect it can only clear by starting to keep one.
