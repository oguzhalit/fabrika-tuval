/**
 * The end-to-end half: the **exit status and the bytes on each channel** a shell caller reads.

 * Only a subprocess proves those, and each `it` costs one cold node+TS load of `bin.ts` — so spawn
 * count is this file's cost (`.patterns/subprocess-test-budget.md`). One spawn, for the fact no
 * in-process test can establish: the answer channel carries the answer and nothing else, with the
 * scope line on stderr. Registration is in `command.unit.test.ts`; everything else about these verbs
 * is covered in-process by the `*-verb.unit.test.ts` files and by `contract-examples.test.ts`.
