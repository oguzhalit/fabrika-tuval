/**
 * `glossary drift`'s candidate extraction, stated deterministically so two implementers agree.
 *
 * Two v1 scars are designed out here rather than inherited. Its tokenizer was `/\b[a-z][a-z-]+\b/g`,
 * which excludes uppercase and all non-ASCII, so every Turkish product noun the glossary exists for
 * was structurally invisible — {@link tokenize} splits on Unicode letter classes instead.
 * And it suppressed a candidate when a declared term contained it **or** it contained a declared
 * term, which against a 226-row register inverts the stated recall bias to about 10% measured
 * precision — suppression here is equality on the normalized key, never containment in either
 * direction.
