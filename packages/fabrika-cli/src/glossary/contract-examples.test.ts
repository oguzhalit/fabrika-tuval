/**
 * The contract's worked examples, reproduced byte for byte against the **committed** fixtures under
 * `packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/`.
 *
 * In-process rather than through a subprocess: what is under test is the bytes each verb produces
 * over a corpus that does not move, and a spawn per example would buy nothing but cost a cold
 * node+TS load each (`.patterns/subprocess-test-budget.md`). The end-to-end facts a subprocess is
 * the only witness for live in `glossary.cli.test.ts`.
 *
 * The reads are the real filesystem through `NodeServices.layer` — the same layer `run.ts` provides
 * — so a fixture that moves reds here instead of drifting away from the document that pins it.
