/**
 * The cleared repair round — one founder grant, one extra round, on top of the one declared budget.
 *
 * The cap in `./retry-budget.ts` is enforced in two places that never see each other: `build
 * verdicts` folds `capReached` off the FAIL-marker round count, and the lane machine guards each
 * task with `retries < maxRetries`. A founder clearance used to live only as issue prose, so the
 * round it granted could only land as an edit outside the loop. This module is the one derivation
 * both readers apply, so a PR read through `build verdicts` and the same PR driven by a lane cannot
 * disagree about whether the loop still has budget.
 *
 * **A grant is keyed by the round it clears, which is what makes it spendable exactly once.** A
 * clearance recorded at round N raises the cap to N+1, so the round it was issued for proceeds; the
 * moment another FAIL lands the count is N+1 and the cap is spent again. Binding the round rather
 * than the head SHA is deliberate — a clearance exists precisely so a *new* head can be pushed, so a
 * head-bound grant would be void the instant it was used.
 *
 * **The cap is the round after the highest cleared one, not the declared cap plus a tally.** Adding
 * one per grant held that invariant only when the grant landed at exactly {@link CAP_ROUND}: a
 * clearance stamped at round 4 with no prior grant raised the cap to 4, so `capReached(4, [4])` was
 * still true and the granted round could not be built — an honoured clearance bought nothing and the
 * lane parked. Taking the maximum is the same number whenever the grants are the contiguous run from
 * `CAP_ROUND` up, and the right one when they are not.
 *
 * A round below the relevant declared cap is never counted. Nothing can be cleared before the budget is
 * spent, so such a marker is either hand-written or from a drifted writer, and counting it would
 * silently widen the cap by a round nobody granted.
