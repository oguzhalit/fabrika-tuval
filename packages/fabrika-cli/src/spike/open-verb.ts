/**
 * `spike open` — mint the spike issue for one question, allocate this run's workspace under a freshly
 * minted nonce, and bind the two in a manifest.
 *
 * Not a judging verb: it supplies an identity. Whether this question deserves a spike stays in the
 * skill; what this verb proves is mechanical — the path is outside the tree, the label exists, the
 * issue read back as sent, and the workspace names it.
 *
 * **Three ordering rules are load-bearing and none is incidental.** The in-tree refusal comes before
 * any write, so a workspace inside the tree never becomes part of the thing the digest measures. The
 * tree digest is taken before the workspace exists, for the same reason. And the workspace is created
 * **before** the issue, so a half-applied run fails toward a local orphan directory `spike dispose`
 * collects rather than toward a public issue nobody holds a nonce for.
 *
 * **An absent workspace is the normal first-run path, not a refusal** — which is why this verb seats
 * `4` for a manifest that does not parse and never `12` for one that is not there, the asymmetry its
 * sibling verbs invert.
