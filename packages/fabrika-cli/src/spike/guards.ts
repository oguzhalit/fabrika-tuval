/**
 * The checks every `spike` verb runs before it decides anything, factored here so five verbs cannot
 * disagree about what an off-grammar nonce is, what an absent workspace is, or what a leak is.
 *
 * Each returns the refusal itself rather than a boolean, so a caller cannot receive "this failed" and
 * then compose a message that drifts from the code it seats.
 *
 * **Absence and unreadability are separated at every read here**, because that is the split the whole
 * group rests on: an absent workspace is `12`, an absent evidence log is a *fact*, and a read that
 * could not be performed is `11` with nothing written.
