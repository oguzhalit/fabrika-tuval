/**
 * The three composed bodies and the marker grammar three behaviours turn on — pure, so recognising a
 * capture is mechanical rather than a prose instruction.
 *
 * **The issue body carries no marker.** A spike is found by its `prototyping:spike` label and its own
 * number, so a marker there would be a second identity to keep in step with them. Only the two
 * comments carry one, on their first line and nothing else.
 *
 * **The run table is transcribed, not summarised.** A reader sees each recorded run's command and
 * status beside the claim rather than a hash standing in for them; the `evidenceDigest` is what
 * proves the table matches the log.
 *
 * **The body never carries a machine-local path**, because a body is published where anyone can read
 * it. The prose parts never place one there; the run table is transcribed from argv a caller chose,
 * so it is masked here at composition — the workspace root by class as `<workspace>`, anything else
 * by the leak scanner's own class masks. The caller cannot edit an argv already on the log, so a
 * refusal over it would have no remedy.
