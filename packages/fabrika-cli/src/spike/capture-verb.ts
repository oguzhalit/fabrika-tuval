/**
 * `spike capture` — post the decision plus the log's own run table, read it back, and close the spike.
 *
 * **Zero recorded runs reds** (`14`): "I ran nothing and it worked" is a pass this verb must never
 * emit — a guard that cannot fail is not a guard, and this is the precondition the verb most exists
 * for. A decision with no recorded run is a self-report, not evidence.
 *
 * **The ACL gate precedes every write on every path, the idempotent one included**, because a close
 * is a write and only an author who holds write authority may record a decision; authority is
 * checked before writes rather than around them. A permission read that fails is `11` — UNKNOWN,
 * never a grant and never a demotion.
 *
 * **The re-entry story is the marker branch.** A marker whose digest equals the current one means the
 * decision already covers the log, so nothing is posted and the stdin just read is **discarded** —
 * re-wording a decision without recording a new run changes nothing, and a caller who meant to revise
 * must run something first so the digest moves. A marker whose digest differs means runs were
 * recorded after that decision, so a superseding comment is posted and the spike closes either way:
 * that is what makes `spike dispose`'s `21` a detour rather than a trap.
