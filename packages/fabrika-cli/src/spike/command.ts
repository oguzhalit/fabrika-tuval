/**
 * The `spike` verb group — `fabrika spike <open|run|capture|dispose|status>`, the `prototyping`
 * skill's half of the ideation layer.
 *
 * The adapter and nothing else: it declares the flags (`--help` is the interface, so every flag
 * carries a one-line description), reads the two machine facts this group does not derive — the OS
 * temp root and a cryptographic random source — runs the pure verb, and emits its outcome. Every
 * decision lives in the `*-verb.ts` modules beside it, which is what makes each refusal testable
 * without spawning a process.
 *
 * **Every leaf is declared with `leafCommand`, never a bare `Command.make`** — the bare form silently
 * opts out of the excess-operand guard, which `../excess-operand.unit.test.ts` reds on.
 *
 * **`--kind` is declared as a string and checked in the verb.** The check is the closed set's, and
 * seating it in the verb is what lets the refusal name the whole vocabulary and seat it on `10`
 * rather than emit the parser's generic message.
