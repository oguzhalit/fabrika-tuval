/**
 * `spike dispose` — prove the repository tree is unchanged and the capture still covers the log,
 * remove the workspace, and prove it is gone.
 *
 * This is the group's one **judging** verb: it judges whether the throwaway stayed thrown away, and
 * its verdict rests on the digest comparison stated on stderr as the scope line. An absent manifest
 * is `12` before any judgment is attempted, never a clean verdict over nothing.
 *
 * **The tree comparison runs first — before any state read and before any write.** That ordering is
 * what keeps a `17`, the refusal this verb most exists for, from destroying the leak it just found.
 * It does **not** make every non-zero exit write-free: `8`, `9` and `16` all sit past the
 * `--forfeit` write or past the removal.
 *
 * **`--forfeit` relaxes neither `17` nor `21`.** Forfeiting is about the absence of a decision; those
 * two are about whether the throwaway stayed thrown away and whether the record is current, and they
 * are independent questions.
 *
 * **A manifest carrying `spike: null` skips the issue half entirely** — no `15`, no `21`, no forfeit,
 * no GitHub read — leaving only the tree comparison and the removal, so the orphaned workspace a `20`
 * leaves behind is always collectable.
