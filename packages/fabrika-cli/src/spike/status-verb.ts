/**
 * `spike status` — one run's spike state, workspace presence, and evidence count.
 *
 * **Deliberately near-total: it reports per-field state inside exit `0` rather than refusing**,
 * because its consumer is a session resuming cold, and a resuming session that gets a refusal learns
 * nothing about where it is. So an absent workspace is a **fact** here (`workspace: "absent"`, every
 * workspace-derived field `null`) while the same absence is a refusal (`12`) in the mutating verbs —
 * two consumers, two correct treatments, and the asymmetry is stated rather than left to be "fixed".
 *
 * **The bound on that near-totality is that a state it cannot read is never rendered as a plausible
 * default.** `4` and `11` still refuse: a workspace that cannot be described is not "absent", and a
 * default standing in for an unreadable field would be a green report over nothing.
 *
 * An **absent `evidence.jsonl` under a present workspace** yields `runs: 0`, `lastCommandExit: null`
 * and `evidenceDigest: null`, also a fact: a log that was never written is not a log that hashes to
 * the empty string.

 * The issue half of the answer.
 *
 * A **provisional** manifest names no spike, so there is nothing to read and `spikeState` is `null`.
 * A spike that is **proven absent** is also reported as `null` rather than refused — this verb holds
 * no `7` seat and its consumer cannot act on a refusal — but the stderr note says which of the two it
 * was, so the proven case is never silently indistinguishable from "no spike named". A read that
 * *failed* is `11`, as everywhere else in this group.
