/**
 * The packaged copy still boots a lane — the half of `lane open` that only a real build and a real
 * pack can prove.
 *
 * `lane/command.ts` resolves its workflow templates by path off `import.meta.url`, and `tsc` copies
 * no file it does not compile, so `dist/lane/templates/` never existed and every install outside
 * this checkout booted nothing. No in-process test could see it: read from `src/`, the
 * templates are right there. What is under test is the *build output*, so this suite builds and
 * packs for real and drives the tarball's own `dist/bin.js`.
 *
 * The tarball is unpacked with the package's own `node_modules` symlinked beside it rather than
 * installed from a registry: what the defect is about is which files the tarball carries, and a
 * real dependency install proves nothing further while putting the network on a gate path
 * (`.patterns/subprocess-test-budget.md`).
