/**
 * Resolve `fabrika <token> …` against the command tree before the Effect CLI runner sees it, so an
 * unresolvable path is refused instead of answered.
 *
 * The runner cannot do this itself. `Command.runWith` processes **action flags** (step 5) before it
 * inspects accumulated **parse errors** (step 6), and `--help` is an action flag — so a `--help`
 * anywhere in argv runs the help action and returns, discarding the `UnknownSubcommand` error the
 * parser already put in `parsedArgs.errors`. Verified in the installed dependency,
 * `effect@4.0.0-beta.92`, `src/unstable/cli/Command.ts`: line 2327 `// 5. Process action flags —
 * first present action wins, then exit`, line 2341 `// 6. Handle parsing errors`. Without `--help`
 * step 6 raises `ShowHelp` carrying the errors and the process exits 1; with it, exit 0 and the
 * deepest valid prefix's help — at any depth, discarding any number of invalid tail tokens.
 *
 * That matters because `--help` is fabrika's designated discovery probe
 * (`claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/cli-interface-convention.md` §1): the one probe meant to answer
 * "does this path exist?" answered yes for paths that do not.
 *
 * The guard runs on every invocation, not only ones carrying `--help`, so one refusal shape covers
 * both — and it seats that refusal the way §2/§3 of the convention require: the reason on stderr,
 * nothing on stdout, a non-zero exit.

 * fail-safe direction for a guard whose output is a refusal:
 *
 * - **A leaf ends the walk.** A node with no subcommands takes arguments, so its tokens are its own.
 * - **A flag ends the walk.** A later bare token may be that flag's value (`--log-level debug`), and
 *   reading a flag value as a subcommand would refuse a valid invocation.
 *
 * One divergence from the parser: it suppresses `UnknownSubcommand` when the node *also* declares
 * positional arguments (`resolveFirstValue`'s `expectsArgs` branch), which the public `Command`
 * surface does not expose. No fabrika node has both — every node carrying subcommands is a bare
 * `Command.make(name)` router — and `unknown-subcommand.unit.test.ts` re-proves that against the
