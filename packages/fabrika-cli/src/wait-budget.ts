/**
 * How many times a driver may re-fold a lane that is waiting on something outside it, before the
 * wait escalates to a human — and how long each of those re-folds has to wait for its turn.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT [`RETRY_BUDGET`](retry-budget.ts). A retry is a repair round — the lane failed and is
 * spending a chance to fix itself — and a wait is a lane that did nothing wrong sitting behind a
 * merge queue. Riding one counter would make a PR that dwelt in the queue arrive at its first real
 * FAIL with no repair rounds left, which is a budget spent on a queue's clock rather than on the
 * work. The two counters therefore stay separate.
 *
 * The value is four observations of the same wait: the shipper's own bounded watch, then three
 * driver re-folds. The wait that forced this bound sat ~13m45s against the shipper's ~480s horizon,
 * so a bound of three covers roughly four horizons without ever letting the wait run open-ended.
 *
 * **The budget is floored as well as counted.** A count alone measures driver speed: lane 6915 spent
 * two of its three waits inside roughly ninety seconds while its PR was clean and simply queued, so
 * the third pass would have parked a person over a dwell this pipeline calls normal. Each re-fold
 * now has to clear {@link WAIT_FLOOR_SECONDS} of elapsed time before `lane report` will record it.
