/**
 * `guard readme-guard check` — every real workspace member carries a `README.md`.
 *
 * The convention is the root `CLAUDE.md`'s: a package with no README has no entry point for a
 * reader or a consumer. Nothing enforced it and two packages drifted README-less, which is why this
 * is a gate rather than a lint.
 *
 * The verb is scope plus a rule and nothing else — the scan lives in `./members.ts`, the taxonomy
 * and the output shape in `./verdict.ts`. What is left here is the two facts this guard adds: the
 * `packages/*` glob must still be declared, and each member under it must hold a README.
 *
 * Under a `Change` scope only the members the change touches are judged, and the declared-glob and
 * zero-member floors still read the whole tree. A consumer repo whose older packages predate the rule
 * is then red only on a lane that adds or edits a README-less member, never on every lane.
