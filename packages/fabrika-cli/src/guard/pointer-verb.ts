/**
 * `guard pointer-guard check` — every backticked repo path in a tracked `CLAUDE.md` resolves.
 *
 * Scope is the git-tracked `CLAUDE.md` set: `node_modules` docs and untracked scratch files are out,
 * and a renamed target reds the moment a referencing CLAUDE.md is committed. Decision-history and
 * pattern docs are deliberately not scanned — history legitimately names code that has since moved,
 * and pattern docs cite external dependency trees that resolution alone cannot tell from a deleted
 * in-repo path.
 *
 * **`git ls-files` is proven before any `check-ignore` runs.** A failed subprocess reads as "not
 * ignored" at that seam, so a `git` that cannot run at all would turn every pointer stale and
 * report a tree-wide violation. Listing first means a broken `git` lands on UNKNOWN instead.
