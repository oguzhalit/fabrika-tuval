/**
 * `catalog-guard`'s pure half — is every dependency in a workspace `package.json` sourced from the
 * pnpm `catalog:` (or an internal `workspace:` ref) rather than a hardcoded version string?
 *
 * The rule is the root `CLAUDE.md`'s "Every dependency via `catalog:`": one shared version per dep,
 * declared once in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. A hardcoded semver introduces a second version and breaks
 * frozen-lockfile CI downstream — a PR once hardcoded `@distilled.cloud/cloudflare` and did exactly
 * that. The convention was written but unenforced, so it held only by reviewer vigilance.
 *
 * Scope and the fail-closed floor live at the IO boundary in `./catalog-verb.ts`; this module never
 * touches disk and never decides what a scan covered.
