/**
 * GitHub workflow-command annotations — how a red guard lands on the PR diff instead of in a log
 * dig. This is the one module that knows the syntax: the location model, the escaping, and
 * the "only under Actions" predicate.
 *
 * A location is a closed union rather than optional `file`/`line` fields, so the state GitHub
 * silently drops — a `line=` with no `file=` — cannot be constructed.
 *
 * **The commands ride on stderr here, where v1 wrote them to stdout.** The runner wires
 * BOTH streams of a `run:` step into an `OutputManager` over the same `ActionCommandManager`
 * (`actions/runner`, `src/Runner.Worker/Handlers/ScriptHandler.cs`: `StepHost.OutputDataReceived`
 * and `StepHost.ErrorDataReceived` both feed one command manager), so a command on stderr is parsed
 * exactly as one on stdout. That is what lets a guard keep fabrika's stdout invariant — a non-zero
 * exit carries NOTHING on stdout (`../verb.ts`) — without losing the annotation.
