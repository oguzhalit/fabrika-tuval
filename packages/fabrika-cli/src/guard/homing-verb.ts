/**
 * `guard homing-guard check [--issue N]` — the board read behind the home-xor-exempt decision.
 *
 * Two scopes, and the difference is what an empty one means. The bare sweep reads the whole open
 * `status:triaged` set and reds on an empty one, like every guard here; `--issue N` is the per-issue
 * seam check a triage sweep runs right after it stamps the label, and an issue that is simply not
 * triaged is a pass over a scan of one.
 *
 * The `--issue` fork reads the repository's label set too, but only when the issue turns out not to
 * be triaged: without that read an empty result cannot be told from a repo that never defined
 * `status:triaged`, and the seam guard would report clean forever having checked nothing.
 *
 * The standing lanes arrive as the delivery layer's config read, refusal included: an unreadable
 * declaration cannot say which labels exempt an issue, so it is UNKNOWN here and never "no lanes",
 * which would red every lane-homed issue as un-homed.
 *
 * The whole decision lives in `./homing.ts`; this file resolves the repo, reads, and emits.
