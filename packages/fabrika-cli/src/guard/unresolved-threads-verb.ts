/**
 * `guard unresolved-threads check` — the review-thread accounting merge gate.
 *
 * The whole decision is in `./unresolved-threads.ts`; this file is the two reads it rests on and the
 * fail-closed posture around them.
 *
 * - The threads come from `ship`'s `listReviewThreads` — the one sanctioned GraphQL path (REST has
 *   no `isResolved`), already paged and count-proved. A short read is UNKNOWN here, never a shorter
 *   thread list, because a verdict over a truncated set is a verdict over unknown scope.
 * - The verdict body is the newest `review-code:` marker whose author holds write+ on the repo.
 *   Without that gate a forged `review-code: PASS … path:line` from anyone with a
 *   keyboard would account for the very thread it is hiding.
 * - Those comments come from `listCommentsReconciled`, the sanctioned reader, and not from
 *   `listComments` compared against a count of the caller's own. The count has to be the **later**
 *   fact for a shortfall to prove anything: reading it first makes every comment written between
 *   the two reads look like a page that never arrived, which is how this guard came to red a pull
 *   request with nothing wrong on it. The reader lists
 *   first, counts second, and re-reads a shortfall on a bounded backoff — the shape
 *   [.patterns/github-read-completeness-proofs.md](../../../../.patterns/github-read-completeness-proofs.md)
 *   rules for a read whose answer depends on somebody else's recent write.
 *
 * **An unreadable ACL drops the marker rather than refusing the run.** That is the opposite of
 * `ship gate`, and deliberately: there, a dropped verdict reads as `absent` and the gate must not
 * decide, while here dropping one can only *add* unaccounted threads — the guard gets stricter, never
 * more permissive. What must never be dropped is a thread or a comment page, so both of those reads
 * fail to `11`.
