/**
 * `patch-guard`'s pure half — does every maintained `pnpm patch` carry a registered
 * behavior-pinning test, and is no pin stale?
 *
 * The two-layer discipline this enforces is defined once in
 * [.patterns/dependency-patch-behavior-pins.md](../../../../.patterns/dependency-patch-behavior-pins.md):
 * a `pnpm patch` is a silent fork of a dependency's behavior, so each patch must be pinned by a
 * test that fails if the patched behavior regresses, and that test self-registers with a
 * `// @patch-pin: <name>@<version>` marker keyed to the exact `patchedDependencies` entry. This
 * guard is the forcing function — a patch with no registered pin is a fork nothing verifies.
 *
 * IO-free: the workspace read and the test-tree walk live in `./patch-verb.ts`.
