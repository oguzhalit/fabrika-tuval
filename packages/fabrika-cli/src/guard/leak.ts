/**
 * The authoritative leak gate's pure half — does a committed file put a machine-local filesystem
 * path into a shared artifact? Ported off v1's `leak-guard scan`.
 *
 * CI is the unbypassable surface here: it is the only place that sees every PR's diff whatever
 * wrote it (an agent tool, an editor, a `cat >`, a human commit), which is why the rule lives as a
 * required check rather than a write-time hook.
 *
 * **Two surfaces, `doc` and `shell`.** Shell was added because the doc-only premise expired: the
 * rule was written when all pipeline shell lived inside markdown fences, and extracting that shell
 * into standalone `.sh` files walked the exact bytes off the guard's surface while the required
 * check kept exiting 0. A `.sh` is scanned whole, comments included — unlike an
 * *invocation* guard, a machine-local path is a leak wherever it sits in a committed file, and a
 * shell comment is the likeliest place for one to land.
 *
 * **The path shapes live here rather than in a module of their own.** In v1 they sat in a separate
 * `path-matcher.ts` because two detectors consumed them and a carve-out had landed on one copy only.
 * Here the gate is the single consumer, so a second file would be indirection with no
 * second reader. What still keeps the shapes honest is the golden fixture: `build check
 * --surface prose` predicts this gate in-tree from its own copy in `../build/doc-leaks.ts`, and
 * `./leak.golden.test.ts` pins this list against the same committed bytes that one pins against.
 *
 * Every arm is a generic structural shape. None names an operator, a machine or a repo.
