/**
 * Which directories are real workspace members — the scope half of every guard that judges the
 * repo's own packages.
 *
 * The load-bearing detail is what "member" means: a directory matching a declared member glob is a
 * member ONLY when it carries a `package.json`. A bare directory with none is a dead shell (a
 * consolidation leaves them behind — a stale `.turbo/` log and nothing else), and a guard that
 * counted one would red on litter instead of on a real gap.
 *
 * The scope is grounded in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s declared globs rather than in a hardcoded
 * `"packages"` literal, so a guard tracks a workspace reshape instead of scanning a phantom
 * directory. {@link MemberScan.declared} is returned alongside the members precisely so a guard can
 * assert the glob it cares about is still declared — which is a different failure from finding no
 * members under it, and the two want different reports.
 *
 * `pnpmWorkspaceGlobs` is reused from `../delegate/root.ts` rather than re-parsed here: the
 * delegation already had to read this file, and a second parser is a second answer.
