/**
 * `guard roadmap-guard check`'s pure core — does `ROADMAP.md` still agree with the live milestone
 * projection? Ported from v1's `roadmap-guard`.
 *
 * **`ROADMAP.md` is the only surface parsed here.** Milestones are the projection it is checked
 * against, never a second source it is reconciled with — so drift always has one author.
 *
 * The five invariants, because they live nowhere else:
 *   I1 — every row pins its milestone BY NUMBER and that milestone exists. A `queued` arc gets its
 *        milestone on activation, so a queued arc with no pin is legal; nothing else may defer.
 *   I2 — EXACTLY ONE arc is `active`. Arcs only: campaigns run concurrently.
 *   I3 — every OPEN milestone is claimed by some row.
 *   I4 — zero arc rows or zero milestones fails closed, never a vacuous green.
 *   I5 — an `active` or `paused` row's milestone is open and a `done` row's is closed. A queued arc
 *        is exempt (I1's lazy pin); a row whose pin dangles is already an I1 and is not re-reported.
 *
 * I6 — the focus-row-honesty check — retired with the `## Focus` table it kept honest: a campaign's
 * `State` cell is the one place a theme's lifecycle is declared, so there is no second declaration
 * surface left to reconcile.
 *
 * Total and IO-free: `./roadmap-verb.ts` reads the file and the projection.
