/**
 * `guard decisions-index validate` core — the ADR number lock: every record in the decision corpus
 * declares the four index fields, its filename number and its frontmatter `id` name the same ADR,
 * and no two records claim one id.
 *
 * The two invariants are one guard because they compose. The id-keyed duplicate check is what
 * catches the collision class — two branches each minting 0284, green apart, colliding once
 * both land — and it only sees a filename collision because the prefix↔`id` lock forces the two
 * axes to agree. Drop either half and a collision hides behind the other axis.
 *
 * IO-free: pure over the files' names and texts. The directory read lives in
 * `./decisions-number-verb.ts`, and the frontmatter/id parsing is fabrika's own
 * `../adr/records.ts` — this guard adds the rules, not a second parser.
