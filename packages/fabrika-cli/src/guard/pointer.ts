/**
 * `pointer-guard`'s pure half — which backticked repo paths a `CLAUDE.md` points at, so the gate can
 * ask whether each still resolves.
 *
 * This closes the gap the `doc-links` gate cannot see by construction. `doc-links` validates
 * markdown `[text](path)` links and deliberately MASKS code spans, because a `[x](y)` inside
 * backticks is an example rather than a link. But CLAUDE.md leans on a different reference class:
 * backticked prose pointers — "operate from the repo root, never `apps/site`", a pointer at
 * `apps/site/worker/dom/settings.ts`. When the target moves, that pointer rots unseen. The two gates
 * are complementary: one reads link targets and masks code, this one reads code spans and ignores
 * link syntax.
 *
 * **Precision over recall.** Not every backticked token is a path — `catalog:`, `type:bug`, `pnpm
 * dev`, a regex, a snippet. A token is treated as a pointer only when it is unambiguously
 * repo-root-relative: whitespace-free, no scheme or glob or call or placeholder syntax, and
 * beginning with a known repo top-level segment. That ignores bare basenames and app-relative
 * shorthand, which prose uses freely, at the cost of missing a stale partial pointer. A gate that
 * cries wolf is a gate people route around.
