/**
 * `guard leak-guard scan <file>...` — the authoritative no-machine-local-paths gate over a change's
 * files, ported off v1's `leak-guard scan`.
 *
 * The argument shape is part of the port: CI resolves the diff and hands the file list in, because
 * the scan's scope IS the change. The verb self-scopes from there — `findLeaks` reads only doc and
 * shell surfaces — so a workflow may hand it every changed file without filtering.
 *
 * **An empty list reds.** v1 answered a zero-file invocation with a clean pass, which is the one
 * shape a broken caller produces and the one a gate must never reward. A file that could
 * not be READ reds too, on the UNKNOWN seat rather than the violation one — v1 skipped it silently,
 * and a skipped file is indistinguishable from a clean one: a gate that skips quietly passes.
