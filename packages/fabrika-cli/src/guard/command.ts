/**
 * The `guard` verb group — `fabrika guard <name> check`, this repository's fail-closed CI gates.
 *
 * Unlike every other group here, this one nests: a guard is its own subcommand and `check` is its
 * leaf, so CI reads `node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts guard readme-guard check` — the shape
 * `governance-floor.yml` already uses, with the guard's name where a reader expects it. Each ported
 * guard appends one row to {@link registry} and one `<name>-verb.ts` beside this file; nothing else
 * about the group changes, which is what keeps five batches of ports off each other's lines.
 *
 * A row carries the guard's command **and its local-tree membership** — whether `build check` runs
 * it over the checked-out tree, and under which leaf. See `local-tree.ts`.
 *
 * The adapter and nothing else: it declares the flags, reads the two machine facts the verbs do not
 * derive — the working directory and the environment — runs the pure verb, and emits its outcome.
