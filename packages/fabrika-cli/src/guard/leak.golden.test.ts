/**
 * The gate's half of the doc-leak vocabulary pin.
 *
 * `build check --surface prose` predicts this gate in-tree from its own copy of the path shapes in
 * `../build/doc-leaks.ts`, and the two copies must carry the same bytes or the predictor and the
 * gate disagree on real files — the two copies have drifted apart before with nothing red. Both sides now live in this package, but they stay separate modules because they
 * answer different questions: the predictor scans markdown only and reads its exemptions from
 * `.fabrika.jsonc`, while the gate also scans a shell surface and carries its own self-exempt list.
 * So the fixture stays the arbiter, read at test time and never imported.
 *
 * The second pin is the markdown half of {@link DOC_SELF_EXEMPT} against `.fabrika.jsonc`'s
 * `docLeakExempt` — one policy this repo declares twice, held equal here rather than in a comment.
