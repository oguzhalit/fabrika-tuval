/**
 * What a guard scans when its scope is "the change" rather than "the tree" — and what that means on
 * each CI leg.
 *
 * Today every workflow that needs this resolves it in inline shell, and each copy re-derives the
 * same four-way branch from `github.base_ref` / `github.event.merge_group.base_sha`
 * (`.github/workflows/leak-guard.yml`, `.github/workflows/cli-invocation-guard.yml`). Those copies
 * are where the fail-open lives: a base that resolves to the empty string reaches `git fetch origin
 * ""` and the diff silently becomes "nothing changed". Here the empty case has a name and no
 * `Basis` value, so a guard cannot scan a base of nothing without noticing.
 *
 * The legs, as the workflows establish them:
 *
 * - `pull_request` — `base_ref` is the target branch; the basis is `origin/<base_ref>...HEAD`.
 * - `merge_group` — `base_ref` is EMPTY on the batched ref, so the basis is the queue's
 *   `merge_group.base_sha`, which yields the files the batch adds vs `main`.
 * - `workflow_dispatch` — both are empty; a dispatch carries a ref, not a base. The dispatched ref
 *   targets the default branch, and the three-dot range resolves that to the merge-base.
 * - `push` to the default branch — there is no baseline at all, and that is deliberate: the whole
 *   tree is in scope, so a violation already on `main` keeps redding until someone clears it.
 *
 * Anything else is {@link Unresolvable} — never quietly the whole tree and never an empty diff.
