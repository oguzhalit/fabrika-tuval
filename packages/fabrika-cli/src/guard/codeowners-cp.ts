/**
 * `guard codeowners-cp check` core — every path the §CP regex marks control-plane has a covering
 * `.github/CODEOWNERS` row.
 *
 * The drift it closes: §CP is one anchored regex, CODEOWNERS enumerates the same paths
 * LITERALLY, and a pattern set and a literal set drift silently. A §CP path added to the regex with
 * no CODEOWNERS row is control-plane by regex yet outside `require_code_owner_review` — and when a
 * branch ruleset pairs `required_approving_review_count: 0` with `require_code_owner_review:
 * true`, a path matching NO row merges on ZERO approvals. This reads the §CP set FROM
 * the regex, never a re-hardcoded copy.
 *
 * **This is the one §CP site that is deliberately PATH-ONLY, and it is not a defect.**
 * Everywhere else a bare path answer is non-authoritative — §CP has a second, content-inferred
 * source (a guard-touching decision record). CODEOWNERS structurally cannot express a
 * content predicate: GitHub matches it on paths. So the content clause is enforced at the
 * merge-deciding gates, which is where a merge is actually decided.
 *
 * IO-free: pure over the CODEOWNERS text and the regex const. The read lives in
 * `./codeowners-cp-verb.ts`.
