/**
 * `portability-guard`'s pure half — is there a reference in fabrika's own text that resolves only in
 * the repository fabrika grew up in?
 *
 * fabrika installs into repositories that are not its home. Every issue number, decision-record
 * number, decision-corpus link and product name left in a skill, a contract or a docblock is a
 * pointer an adopter cannot follow: the exit-code rationale names a ticket they cannot open and the
 * step names a product they do not have. Nothing else in the corpus catches one, and every lane that
 * edits a skill adds more.
 *
 * The five matchers below are the whole rule. Four things are deliberately not hits: a markdown
 * heading (`#` with no digits behind it), a hex colour (`#fff`, `#1a1a1a` — a colour carries letters
 * or too few digits to be a ticket), a ticket number that is test *data* — the subject under test in
 * a `*.test.ts` string literal, or anything under a fixtures directory, where the number is the
 * input rather than a claim about the world — and an `@ruling` citation under
 * {@link CITATION_ROOT}, which is a link into fabrika's own history rather than into the reader's
 * tree.
 *
 * Scope, the fail-closed floor and the allow-list live at the IO boundary in `./portability-verb.ts`;
 * this module never touches disk and never decides what a scan covered.
