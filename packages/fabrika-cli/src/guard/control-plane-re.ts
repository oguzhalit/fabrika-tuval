/**
 * The §CP control-plane boundary — the one anchored regex that says which paths are
 * human-merge-only.
 *
 * It lives as a const rather than a literal each consumer copies: it used to be hand-copied into
 * ~10 surfaces guarded only by a byte-compare that missed three vitest fixtures, and a stale fixture
 * assertion ran only in `merge_group` and silently ejected 3 green PRs. Everything
 * importable imports this.
 *
 * The value is the POSIX-ERE grep/jq form; the doubled backslashes are TS escapes, so `\\.` is the
 * value `\.`.
 *
 * Two branch groups are worth naming because their scope is not obvious from the pattern:
 *
 * - The old pipeline-plugin clauses (skills/, lib/, agents/, hooks) retired with the plugin itself,
 *   and the enforcement-core clauses over the v1 verb package retired with that package: both trees
 *   are deleted, so they classified paths that can no longer exist, and their CODEOWNERS rows went
 *   with them.
 * - `^packages/fabrika-cli/src/ci/` is the ONE §CP path in THIS package, and the narrowness is the
 *   ruling, not an omission: `ci-required`'s verdict core lives here, and it must stay covered or
 *   it lands matching no CODEOWNERS row, which merges at zero approvals. The rest of the package is
 *   ordinary by founder ruling.
