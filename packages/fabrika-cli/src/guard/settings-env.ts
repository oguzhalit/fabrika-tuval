/**
 * `settings-env-guard`'s pure half — does any `.claude/settings.json` `env` VALUE carry an
 * unexpanded `${...}` token?
 *
 * The invariant, grounded once: Claude Code applies settings.json `env` values VERBATIM — it does
 * NOT expand `${VAR}` in them (the settings docs describe `env` as "environment variables applied
 * to every session" and document no interpolation; verified on both the desktop and the web
 * harness). So a `${...}` in an env value never resolves: it is consumed literally, which is how
 * `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` became a stray directory at the repo root and clobbered PATH. A
 * checkout- or session-relative path an env value wants is resolved in the consuming hook, from
 * the hook-exported `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, never wired as an env-value expansion.
 *
 * An empty `env` block is a legitimate pass, not a vacuous one: the scan covered the whole block
 * and found nothing to expand. The fail-closed case is the FILE — a settings.json that is absent or
 * does not parse — and it lives at the IO boundary in `./settings-env-verb.ts`, not here.
