/**
 * The IO-free core of `guard unresolved-threads check` — the accounting question `ship threads`
 * hands off: is every live-unresolved review thread NAMED in the latest authorized `review-code:`
 * verdict?
 *
 * The rule the review contract states as reviewer prose, given teeth. A `review-code` agent could
 * post `PASS … merge-ready` and omit the unresolved-thread accounting entirely, and on a §CP PR — which
 * banks for a manual merge and never reaches the enqueue refusal — that prose was the only thing
 * standing between an unaddressed finding and a human clicking merge. That is what it costs: a
 * CodeQL inline finding once reached a merger under a merge-ready flag.
 *
 * So: a live-unresolved inline thread, human or bot, is unaccounted-for unless the verdict body
 * names its `path:line`. The check is **polarity-blind** — a `[FAIL] unresolved-threads — path:line`
 * row accounts for the thread exactly as a PASS row does, because the FAIL blocks the merge on its
 * own and the thing being gated here is the silent omission, not the reviewer's call. It re-decides
 * nothing about substantive-vs-nit: a genuine nit is discharged the sanctioned way, by resolving the
 * thread with a written rationale, which takes it out of the live set.
 *
 * **Zero threads is a clean pass, not zero scope.** A PR with no review threads is the common,
 * valid state — there is nothing to account for. The fail-closed case is an UNREADABLE thread
 * channel, and that lives in `./unresolved-threads-verb.ts` where the read happens.
