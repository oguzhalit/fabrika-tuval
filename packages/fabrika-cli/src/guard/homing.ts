/**
 * `guard homing-guard check` — the decision: did every `status:triaged` issue leave triage with
 * exactly one home?
 *
 * Home and exemption are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE: a triaged issue carries an arc/campaign milestone, or
 * one of the standing-lane labels its repo declares, never both, which is banned outright.
 *
 * **Both directions red here.** Enforcing only the neither-marked half read as full coverage
 * downstream while double-marked issues landed in the `homed` count — a burndown that counts an
 * issue which also claims exemption from it.
 *
 * **The exempt set is an input, never a constant.** A standing lane is milestone-less BY DESIGN,
 * and which labels are one is the repo's own declaration: every decision below takes `lanes`, and
 * in a repo that declares none nothing is exempt — a milestone is the only home.
 *
 * IO-free and total; the board and config reads live in `./homing-verb.ts`.
