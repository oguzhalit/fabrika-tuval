/**
 * The matchers behind `guard no-gh check`: is there a `gh` invocation left in this package's source?
 *
 * Every GitHub call in `packages/fabrika-cli/` moved off the `gh` binary and onto the
 * fetch client in `../io/gh-api.ts`, so that a fabrika verb runs from a token alone — on a phone, on
 * a lean CI image, in a consumer repo. Nothing but this guard holds that: one `execFileSync("gh", …)`
 * puts the binary back on the request path and no test anywhere notices.
 *
 * **Comments are stripped before anything is matched.** This package's docblocks talk about `gh` at
 * length — they have to, they record what the port replaced — and a guard that could not tell
 * `` `gh api --paginate` `` in a sentence from `execCapture("gh", …)` on a line would force every
 * such note out of the source. {@link codeOf} does the stripping with a string-literal-aware scanner
 * rather than a `//`-to-end-of-line cut, because `"https://api.github.com"` is a `//` that starts no
 * comment and truncating there would hide whatever follows it.
