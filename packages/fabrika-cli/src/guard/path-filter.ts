/**
 * `guard path-filter-guard check` core — ci.yml's `changes.e2e` and deploy.yml's `changes.deploy`
 * classify a PR's diff the same way.
 *
 * The invariant: deploy's RUN-set must be a superset of e2e's. ci.yml's `e2e` job polls deploy.yml's
 * sticky `<!-- preview-deploy -->` comment on a 10-minute deadline, so a PR that trips e2e while its
 * deploy skips times the poll out and wedges the required `ci-required` check. Set EQUALITY
 * is the checkable form — equality implies superset, and equality is what the two reciprocal
 * comments in those files already pin.
 *
 * **Equal globs are not enough — the diff BASIS must match too.** The globs decide which paths
 * matter; dorny's `token` and `base` decide which changed-file set they are applied to. Those once
 * drifted while the lists stayed byte-identical, and a PR then showed 22 phantom `e2e:` hits in
 * ci.yml only: `e2e_required` went true, `deploy` correctly skipped, and the poll permanently
 * redded a defect-free PR. This compares both halves.
 *
 * IO-free: a deterministic transform over the two workflow texts. The reads live in
 * `./path-filter-verb.ts`.
