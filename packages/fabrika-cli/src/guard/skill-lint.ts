/**
 * `guard skill-lint check` core — the pure, IO-free matchers that gate the skill
 * corpus. Four independent checks, all fail-closed on zero scope, like every guard
 * here:
 *
 *  1. GraphQL-path `gh` invocations — flags a reflexive `gh project`
 *     / GraphQL `gh pr edit` / `gh api graphql`, enforcing "REST only on this org"
 *     mechanically instead of by memory.
 *  2. Frontmatter YAML validity — parses each SKILL.md / agent .md
 *     `---`-fenced frontmatter block as strict YAML and flags any that does not
 *     parse. This is the durable gate for the recurring defect where an unquoted
 *     `description:` whose prose carries a mid-sentence colon-space (`ritual:
 *     pre-flight`) reparses as a nested mapping and breaks GitHub's renderer — the
 *     tolerant harness loader accepts it, strict parsers reject it, so it shipped
 *     uncaught three times over.
 *  3. Bare `git push` in an executable block — flags any `git … push`
 *     inside a runnable shell block in the corpus, because a bare push cannot report
 *     whether the ref landed: `| tail` eats its exit status (`pipefail` is off here)
 *     and a detached run's output file carries no status at all, so a dead push reads
 *     as a clean one. `fabrika build push` is the sanctioned path — it reads the remote ref
 *     back and prints a PUSH-VERDICT line; this check is what makes that mechanical rather
 *     than attention-based.
 *  4. Non-portable plugin path literal in a fence — flags a repo-relative
 *     `./claude-plugins/…` path inside a fenced block. That literal resolves only inside
 *     the plugin author's own checkout; a marketplace consumer's install lives in their
 *     plugin cache, outside their repo, so the same fence is `No such file or directory`
 *     there. This is the guard that would have caught a live customer-down break, and it
 *     exists because nothing asserted the consumer's case (only the in-repo one).
 *
 * Fails CLOSED on zero scope: `lintCorpus` returns the set of files
 * scanned alongside the findings, and `isZeroScope` reports when nothing was
 * scanned — the CI/bin layer turns that into a FAIL, never a silent PASS. A lint
 * that scanned no files is a broken lint, not a clean one.
 *
 * The IO (reading the skill files) is done by the caller and the contents are
 * handed in, keeping this core pure and unit-testable. The gh-call match is
 * line-scoped; each finding carries the file, the 1-based line number, the matched
 * text, and a reason, so the report points at the exact offending line.
