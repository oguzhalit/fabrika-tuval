/**
 * `guard pitch-guard check [--issue N]` — the board read behind the pitched-or-unpickable decision.
 *
 * Three reads compose one candidate, and the order is the cost control: the label-narrowed sweep
 * shortlists, each shortlisted issue is then re-read singly because the list endpoint omits the
 * parent link, and only then are its comments and their authors' permissions resolved. A parentless
 * feature carrying a `pitch-ruled:` comment costs the reads behind that comment's ruling, and
 * nothing else does.
 *
 * The ACL resolution is fail-closed at the boundary: a permission that cannot be read
 * resolves NOT authorized, so an unverifiable approval stops counting rather than passing.
 *
 * The whole decision lives in `./pitch.ts`; this file resolves the repo, reads, and emits.
