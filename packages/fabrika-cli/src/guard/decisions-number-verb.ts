/**
 * `guard decisions-index validate` — ported off v1's `decisions-index validate`.
 *
 * The verb is the IO boundary and nothing else: list the decision corpus, read each record, hand
 * them to the pure rule in `./decisions-number.ts`, seat the answer on the group's exit taxonomy.
 *
 * Where the corpus is comes from `decisionsDir`, the same resolver `adr` and `governance`
 * read, so a repo that keeps its records elsewhere is scanned rather than reported empty.
 *
 * v1's other three modes did not come with it: `generate`/`check` served a committed corpus index
 * that a later decision deleted, and `compact`/`next` are `fabrika adr`'s
 * (`../adr/`), not a guard's. `validate` is the whole of what CI ran.
