/**
 * `guard codeowners-cp check` — ported off v1's `codeowners-cp check`.
 *
 * The verb is the IO boundary and nothing else: read `.github/CODEOWNERS`, hand it and the §CP
 * boundary const to the pure rule in `./codeowners-cp.ts`, seat the answer on the group's exit
 * taxonomy.
 *
 * **The port drops v1's second leg — the formats-doc byte-compare — because that check already runs
 * elsewhere.** v1 also read the `CONTROL_PLANE_RE='…'` line out of
 * `claude-plugins/kampus-pipeline/skills/gh-issue-intake-formats.md` and redded if it had drifted
 * from the const, because the v1 shell gates re-resolved the boundary from that line on
 * the trunk. No fabrika verb reads that line, and `ci.yml`'s unconditional `skills` job
 * still runs `validate-gate-path-drift.sh`, which is the const↔formats-doc compare in full. Keeping
 * a duplicate here would have pinned a retired plugin's prose as a second merge-blocking source of
 * this boundary.
