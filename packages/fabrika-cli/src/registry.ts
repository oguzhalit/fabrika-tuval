/**
 * The fabrika verb-group registry — the extension seam.
 *
 * One row per verb group exposed as `fabrika <group> <verb> …`. The root command and its
 * `--help` index both read this array, so a group appears under `--help` by being registered and
 * nowhere else: the index is **derived from the registry, never hand-maintained**, which is the
 * defect a parallel hand-written list reintroduces the moment it drifts.
 *
 * The `Name`/`Input` slots sit at `any` because the Effect CLI types demand it here: both
 * are contravariant, so a concrete literal name (`"adr"`) is not assignable to `string` and a
 * group's concrete flag shape is not assignable from `object`. Only `any` admits groups with
 * different names and inputs into one array. The requirement row is bounded by the Node platform
 * services the bin provides; a group needing more bakes its own layer in with `Command.provide`
 * before registering.
