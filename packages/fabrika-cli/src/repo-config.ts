/**
 * The two widen-only keys of `.fabrika.jsonc`, in the shape their callers already read.
 *
 * The surface itself now lives in `config/`: one load, one parse, one module per key group
 * (`config/registry.ts`). This file is the adapter for the two keys that predate it — their
 * callers open the bytes themselves, at the working root (`build check`), and take a text-in /
 * union-out reader.
 *
 * **Both are widen-only policy, where empty IS the strict answer**: nothing is exempt, this repo
 * declares no validator. So each collapses the surface's `Default` and `Malformed` arms into one
 * `Unusable`, carrying the reason through unchanged, and an unreadable file never reaches here — the
 * callers refuse on it before opening these readers.
