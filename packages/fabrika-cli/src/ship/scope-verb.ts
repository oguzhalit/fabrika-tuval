/**
 * `ship scope` — one PR's state, head, linked issue, artifact classes with the review namespaces
 * they require, and the three-state §CP classification.
 *
 * **The class partition and the namespace derivation are one derivation, printed once.** v1 printed
 * the class set from one derivation in one script and hand-copied it in another, and the copy
 * dropped a class on a live PR — so the map is shared code with `review scope`
 * (`../review/classes.ts`), extended here with the `ui` class and nothing else.
 *
 * A `merged`, `draft` or `closed` PR is an **answer**, not a refusal: this verb reports state and
 * the skill acts on it. The write verbs downstream refuse a non-open PR themselves — no verb trusts
 * its dispatch.
 *
 * The `landing` line is the one place the two landing paths are named, so a shipper reads its route
 * here rather than composing it from a merge-queue read and a repository-settings read on two
 * different APIs. It is the one field that **degrades instead of refusing**: an unreadable
 * landing prints `unknown` and costs the run nothing else, because the guard that matters sits on
 * the write — `ship merge` re-derives the same fact itself and refuses `11` where this printed
 * `unknown`, so a degraded read here can never license a landing.
 *
 * **This is also where a shipper proves it is not standing in the driver's checkout.** A spawn flag
 * asking for `isolation: worktree` is a request, not a fact, and a shipper that ran in the driver's
 * tree let that checkout's branch move under a mid-drive operator, which changed which build of
 * these verbs the driver went on executing, with no signal. Every dispatched shipper run carries
 * this read and nothing downstream proceeds without it, so seating the refusal here costs one
 * `git rev-parse` and covers the whole group. `ship disarm --site preflight` runs earlier and
 * deliberately does not carry it: clearing a stale merge intent is safe from any tree, and refusing
 * there would cost the run the one act that protects it.
 *
 * **A repo may lift that refusal for itself, and only in its tracked config.** `shipScope`'s
 * `mainWorkingTree` ships as `refuse`; a repo that keeps one checkout, or ships by hand, declares
 * `allow`, and the read proceeds from the main working tree with a notice saying so. The key is read
 * off the checkout the verb stands in, and only once git proves that checkout is the main working
 * tree, so a shipper in a linked worktree never refuses over a key it does not weigh.
 *
 * **Which runs it binds is {@link ScopeCaller}, and the caller states it.** The refusal is about the
 * shipper's seat, not about the derivation, so an in-process relay that stands on no lane branch and
 * writes to no tree passes `relay` and skips the read entirely — see that type for why a default
 * would be the wrong shape here.
 *
 * **The partition is taken over the enumerated file list, not over GitHub's `changed_files`.** A list
 * short of that declared count used to refuse at `13`, and this is the first verb a `ship` run makes,
 * so the refusal stranded the whole merge path before it started. The count is the stale side —
 * GitHub computes it against a base cached at the PR's last push, which nothing on the shipper's
 * side can invalidate. {@link platformFileSet} owns that argument; the disagreement leaves as a
 * `scanned` line, and the zero-file refusal below is what keeps a partition over an unread diff from
 * printing.
 *
 * **The `13` this verb keeps for that list is the endpoint's own ceiling, not a count comparison.**
 * `pulls/<n>/files` serves at most 3000 files (`PULL_FILES_CAP`) and ends its Link chain normally
 * there, so the pagination proof passes over a list GitHub already truncated — and a class, a
 * namespace or a §CP path could sit in the part it never served.
 *
 * **The classes derive over the PR's own config, never this checkout's.** `.fabrika.jsonc` is read at
 * the PR's head and at the merge base the platform diffs its file list from
 * (`../review/class-config.ts`), so a shipper standing in a stale tree derives what `review scope`
 * derives over the same head.
