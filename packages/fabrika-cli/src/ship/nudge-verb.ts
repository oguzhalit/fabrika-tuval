/**
 * `ship nudge` — the at-most-once dropped-trigger remedy.
 *
 * **The verb trusts nothing it was told.** It re-derives the zero-runs precondition itself, because
 * a mis-dispatched nudge once close→reopened a live green head and left a false comment on it:
 * the caller's `ship checks` output is routing, never authority. A state *proven otherwise*
 * — runs exist, no workflows, PR not open — is `16`, refused without touching the PR.
 *
 * The head ref is untouched by construction: close/reopen preserves it, so SHA-bound verdicts
 * survive. That is why the remedy is this and not a rebase.
 *
 * `17` is the loudest code in the group. The nudge is the group's one two-legged mutation, and v1's
 * unguarded PATCH pair could close a PR, fail the reopen, and still report "nudged". Folding that
 * into `8` would hide the one fact the operator must act on immediately.
