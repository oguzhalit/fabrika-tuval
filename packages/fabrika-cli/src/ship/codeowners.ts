/**
 * The §CP boundary, derived from `.github/CODEOWNERS` itself — the artifact the merge gate
 * enforces — so this group and the gate read one file and cannot disagree.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing and each has an incident behind it:
 *
 * - **Last match wins, and an owner-less row unsets ownership.** That is GitHub's documented rule,
 *   and a repo leans on it to un-own a subtree that a broader row above it would otherwise sweep in.
 * - **A trivial boundary is a printed hold, not a match-everything verdict.** A row that owns
 *   every path, and a boundary file that parses to no owned rows at all, both hold instead.
 * - **The owners are parsed, never hardcoded.** `@<org>/<team>` and individual `@login` owners are
 *   both read off the file, so an adopter repo with a different team, or with no org at all, is
 *   answered rather than mis-answered. Individual owners count exactly as team owners do: GitHub
 *   discharges a row when any listed owner approves, and a personal repo whose owners are all
 *   individuals used to classify `unknown` — the HOLD state — which deadlocked every PR in it.
