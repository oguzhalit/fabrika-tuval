/**
 * `ship floor-batch` — the `governance floor at head` context on a merge queue's batch ref.
 *
 * A required status check is demanded on the queue's batched `merge_group` ref, not only on the PR
 * ref, and a workflow only runs there if it carries a `merge_group:` trigger. `governance-floor.yml`
 * had `pull_request:` alone, so the moment the floor was added to the ruleset's required set the
 * batch could never carry the context and every queued merge hung toward the check timeout — the
 * repo-wide freeze. The same omission had already frozen the queue once on the required CI context.
 *
 * **The batch ref has nothing to re-derive, so this verb resolves no floor.** A `merge_group` ref is
 * not a pull request: it has no number, no changed-file list against a base a verdict was written
 * over, no comments and no reviews. `ship floor` reads all four, so on a batch it has no input at
 * all — the pass here is the absence of a question, not a question waved through.
 *
 * **What still holds the floor is the PR ref.** Each PR in a batch was floor-gated at its own head
 * by `ship floor --publish-check`, and `ship gate` — the single merge authority — refuses a
 * governance-root PR whose `governance` verdict is absent, stale or FAIL before `ship enqueue` is
 * ever reached. Nothing about that changes here; this verb only puts the context where the queue
 * looks for it.
