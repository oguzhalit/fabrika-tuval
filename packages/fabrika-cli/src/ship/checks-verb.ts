/**
 * `ship checks` — the head CI rollup, with the running-vs-wedged split and the zero-checkset facts.
 *
 * The rollup itself is **the shipped `review ci` module, extended rather than forked**
 * (`../review/rollup.ts`): same bucket rules, same fail-closed direction on the ambiguous rows. This
 * group adds two things on top — the wedge diagnosis and the informational-check carve-out — and
 * both live in that same module so a second copy cannot drift the way v1's two `jq` copies did.
 *
 * See the checks help in ./command.ts for rollup states and output fields.
 *
 * A `green` is served only over bytes a gate of this repo's own inspected: the coverage read is
 * `../review/gate-coverage.ts`, the same module `review ci` refuses on, and a head where every
 * repo-authored workflow was silent refuses on {@link NO_GATE_COVERAGE} rather than printing the
 * word this group merges on. Silent means no run that opened *this* head: a repo-authored
 * `pull_request_target` run carries the head and checks out the base, so the run's own event and
 * head are what that module judges, never its workflow path alone.
