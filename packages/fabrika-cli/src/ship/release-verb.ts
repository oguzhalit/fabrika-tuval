/**
 * `ship release` — dark-ship detection and the board's awaiting-release status label
 * (`status:awaiting-release` unless the repo renamed it).
 *
 * Agents deploy, humans release: the label is the seam and the whole action. Nothing here
 * flips or validates a flag.
 *
 * `no-issue` is deliberately its own answer, never folded into `n/a`: a dark-ship signal fired and
 * there is no linked issue to label, which means a dark ship the release queue cannot see — the
 * exact hazard this verb exists to prevent. The label write is read back, because v1's unverified
 * POST could report a release queued that no human would ever find.
 *
 * The write is also taxonomy-guarded like every other board-label writer: GitHub's
 * label POST creates what it cannot find, so on a repo that never bootstrapped its taxonomy an
 * unguarded write mints `status:awaiting-release` with a random colour and no description.
 *
 * **The flag scan runs over the enumerated file list, not over GitHub's `changed_files`.** A list
 * short of that declared count used to refuse at `13`, and the count is the stale side: GitHub
 * computes it against a base cached at the PR's last push, which nothing on the caller's side can
 * invalidate, so the refusal blocked the scan with no act available to clear it.
 * {@link platformFileSet} owns that argument; the disagreement leaves as a `scanned` line.
 *
 * **What survives is an empty list and the endpoint's own ceiling.** A zero would answer `n/a` over
 * a diff nobody read, which is the dark ship this verb exists to catch, so it refuses at `7`. And
 * `pulls/<n>/files` serves at most 3000 files (`PULL_FILES_CAP`) and ends its Link chain normally
 * there, so a flag declaration could sit in the part the platform never served — that stays `13`.
 *
