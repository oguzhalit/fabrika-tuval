/**
 * `ship merge` — land a PR on a base branch no merge queue governs, and prove the landing.
 *
 * **The second landing path, not a flag on the first.** `ship enqueue` carries no merge-method flag
 * by construction, because a method alongside the queue arm conflicts with the queue and no-ops the
 * enqueue silently at exit 0. That argument is about a queue-governed base and says nothing about a
 * base with no queue — where, before this verb, `ship` could land nothing at all. So the
 * method surface lives here, on the path where the queue is *proven absent*, and `ship enqueue`
 * still has none.
 *
 * The queue check is a refusal and never a fallback: a base a queue governs is `ship enqueue`'s, and
 * a direct merge into it walks straight past the gate the queue exists to run. An unreadable queue
 * regime refuses too — this verb never lands on a base whose regime it could not read.
 *
 * The method is read off the repository, never guessed. A repo permitting none of the three refuses
 * on `19` rather than sending the platform a method it will reject.
 *
 * The write is proved the way the arm is: `merged` **and** the merge commit read back off the PR
 * after the call, because the merge call's own response is a claim and not evidence.
