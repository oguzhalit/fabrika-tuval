/**
 * The stdin-and-leak fence the two writing verbs share.
 *
 * **The text arrives on stdin only** — no `--body`, no `--body-file`. A path flag is how a
 * machine-local path reaches a public surface while the poster reads success, and the bare-`@`
 * refusal is that byte pattern caught after the fact.
 *
 * The leak predicate is `../report/leaks.ts`, imported. Two known limits of that seam are inherited
 * rather than resolved here, and the refusals name both: a body that proves path-cleanliness *by
 * example* trips the detector, which is generic by design, and no verb can rewrite a foreign
 * comment. Both route to a human.
