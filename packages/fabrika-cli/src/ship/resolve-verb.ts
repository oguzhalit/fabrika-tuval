/**
 * `ship resolve` — the sanctioned thread-resolution write.
 *
 * Five steps, each gating the next: re-derive the thread's live state and class, leak-scan the
 * rationale, post the reply, fire the resolve, read back. Steps 3–4 are one logical write and the
 * ordering is deliberate — rationale first, so an interrupted run never leaves a silent resolve.
 *
 * **The `16` refusal is the founder ruling's structural anchor.** The nit-vs-substantive call stays
 * in the skill; this verb is the mechanics under it, scoped to positively bot-classed threads, and
 * that scope is enforced by re-deriving the class here rather than trusting the caller's dispatch. A
 * confused caller cannot resolve a human's objection.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no `--sha` and no `12` seat**: a thread is not head-bound, and step 1
 * re-reads its live state at write time, so there is no stale carried observation for `12` to guard.
