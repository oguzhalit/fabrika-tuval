/**
 * Which landing path a base branch has, and which method a direct landing may use.
 *
 * The fact is composed from **two** platform reads that live on different APIs — whether a merge
 * queue governs the branch, and which merge methods the repository permits — and neither read is
 * about the pull request. A shipper left to do that composition itself is the gap this closes: `ship`
 * could arm a queue and nothing else, so a repo with no queue had `allow_auto_merge: false` and
 * `mergeQueue: null` sitting on two endpoints, with no verb reading either.
 *
 * See the scope help in ./command.ts for landing routes. A queue owns the method, so its path
 * skips the permitted-method read. A repo permitting no method cannot be repaired by guessing one.
