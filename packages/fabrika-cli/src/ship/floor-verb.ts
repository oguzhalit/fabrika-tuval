/**
 * `ship floor` — the governance floor as an exit code, so a CI job can red on it.
 *
 * `ship gate` seats `blocked` at exit 0, and that is right for its interface: `blocked` is an answer
 * it proved, and a produced answer goes on 0 (`../verb.ts`). But an answer nobody reads enforces
 * nothing. When the only thing turning `blocked` into a stop was prose in the `ship` skill,
 * governance-root PRs merged with no governance verdict anyway. A workflow step cannot read
 * `gate\tblocked` on its own without deciding in bash, which shell must never do — so the decision is
 * seated here and CI relays this verb's exit code.
 *
 * **One namespace, and the resolution is `runGate`'s own.** This verb is not a second conjunction: it
 * asks `ship gate` for `governance` and reads that one line back, so there is one derivation of an
 * in-force verdict in this package and no rival answer about any other namespace. It decides nothing
 * about enqueue either — `ship gate` stays the single merge authority.
 *
 * **It refuses on WRONG, not only on MISSING.** `absent`, `stale` and `fail` all seat
 * {@link GOVERNANCE_FLOOR_UNMET}; a verdict from an author without write+ resolves `absent` through
 * the ACL gate and lands there too. Only a head-bound PASS from an authorized author is
 * satisfied.
 *
 * **What the floor is, and how it is seated, are two things.** {@link resolveFloor} answers the
 * first and nothing else; {@link runFloor} seats that answer on this verb's exit table, and
 * `./floor-check.ts` seats the same answer on a check-run. Splitting them is what lets the
 * check-run mode distinguish "not judged yet" from "judged wrong" without a second derivation of
 * the floor to disagree with this one.
 *
 * **Whether the floor binds is read off the enumerated file list, not off GitHub's `changed_files`.**
 * A list short of that declared count used to refuse at `13` on the grounds that a governance root
 * could sit in the part nobody read. The count is the stale side — GitHub computes it against a base
 * cached at the PR's last push — so the refusal blocked the merge with no act available to clear it.
 * {@link platformFileSet} owns that argument; the disagreement leaves as a `scanned` line, and the
 * empty-list refusal below is what keeps `not-required` from being answered over a diff nobody read.
 *
 * **The `13` this verb now keeps is the endpoint's own ceiling, not a count comparison.**
 * `pulls/<n>/files` serves at most 3000 files (`PULL_FILES_CAP`) and ends its Link chain normally
 * there, so the pagination proof passes over a list GitHub already truncated — and a governance
 * root could sit in the part it never served. Unlike the retired arm, this one rests on a fact
 * about the read itself rather than on a count computed against a base cached elsewhere.
