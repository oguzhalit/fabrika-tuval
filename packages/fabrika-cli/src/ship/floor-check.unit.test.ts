/**
 * The check-run mode's whole point is that ONE of the blocking states reads as waiting: `absent`
 * means nobody has judged this head yet, and showing that as the same red a FAIL shows is what
 * taught people to stop reading reds. So the battery below pins the conclusion map row by row, and
 * pins the two things the polarity change must not cost — a `stale`/`fail` verdict still concludes
 * failure, and an UNKNOWN still concludes failure rather than waiting.
