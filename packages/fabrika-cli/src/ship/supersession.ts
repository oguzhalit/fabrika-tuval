/**
 * Which check contexts at a head belong to a workflow run something newer already replaced.
 *
 * A repo whose CI declares `concurrency: {group, cancel-in-progress}` cancels its own older run
 * whenever the suite re-fires **without the head moving** — a close/reopen, a base refresh, a rapid
 * second push. The older run's contexts conclude `cancelled` at the same `head_sha` the newer run is
 * still proving, and the dependent aggregator job (`ci-required`) makes it worse: the newer run has
 * not created its own aggregator context yet, so latest-per-context resolves to the cancelled one.
 * `ship checks` then reads a healthy head as a hard red and routes a green PR to `heal-ci`.
 *
 * **Only `cancelled` is reclassified, and only into `pending`.** The rollup's fail-closed default
 * (`../review/rollup.ts`) is load-bearing everywhere else: a cancel proved nothing, and "proved
 * nothing" must never read green. What supersession adds is the one case where something else is
 * proving it right now — so the answer is "wait", not "pass". A `failure` stays red at every level
 * of supersession, and a cancel with no newer run of its workflow at that head stays red too.
