/**
 * `ship gate` — the verdict conjunction over every required namespace, at one head.
 *
 * Two collapses are designed out at two layers. `--require` **accumulates**: a single-valued parse
 * that keeps the first and drops the rest says enqueueable past a live FAIL. And the affirmative
 * answer carries its own proof — the namespace lines are asserted to cover exactly the distinct
 * required set *before* `satisfied` is printed, because a plausible answer with silently narrowed
 * coverage is that defect's signature.
 *
 * In-force resolution is one derivation, not three tests to keep in sync: head-bound first (a
 * live-head verdict strictly outranks recency), then by the body's **write stamp** rather than
 * `created_at` — a FAIL upserted after a PASS must win — with authorization applied as the write+
 * ACL. `absent` and `stale` stay distinct tokens because their remedies differ, and both block: an
 * absent verdict is a refusal, never a pass.
 *
 * **Staleness is the content question, not the head question.** A verdict whose head has moved
 * survives only while the content it bound is still this head's. `inForce`'s ordering is
 * deliberately *not* widened to match: a content-current verdict at a moved head still loses the
 * head-bound tiebreak, so the widening can only ever let a FAIL win an ordering a PASS used to win —
 * never the reverse.
 *
 * The one caller-asserted input is `--cp`, and it reaches **every** resolution in one run — v1
 * passed it to the gate and not the native fold, and a discharged FAIL stayed in force forever.
 * The fold living inside this verb is what makes that seam unrepresentable. Without `--cp` a
 * head-bound advisory still never resolves a namespace, but it is named on stderr: the row then
 * describes whichever older comment the other carriers left, and read alone it sends a driver to
 * re-review a head that already holds a current verdict. That is a notice, not a seventh state.
 *
 * `governance` is the one namespace the caller cannot decline: see {@link requiredWithFloor}.
 *
 * `routed` is the fifth state. It is not a verdict and not a weaker pass: it is a
 * gate recording that this PR's diff holds nothing its rubric is about, which `review-ui`
 * alone needed because its emit path cannot produce a verdict over zero rendered surfaces. See
 * {@link ROUTABLE} for why exactly one namespace may resolve that way. A route a repo's
 * `reviewUi.whenNoPreview` rules admitted carries its basis — `hand-check` or `skip` — onto the
 * row and its stderr line ({@link routedLine}), so nobody reads it as a render.
 *
 * `unopened` is the sixth. A `review-ui` verdict is the one whose proof lives outside the comment —
 * hosted captures a human must be able to open — so it counts only after its evidence is re-read
 * and opens (`../review-ui/standing-evidence.ts`). One that does not open blocks like `absent`.
 *
 * **The enumerated file list is the floor's file set, and `changed_files` no longer refuses.** This
 * verb used to stop at `13` whenever the list came up short of that count, and the count is the
 * stale side: GitHub computes it against a base it cached at the PR's last push, which nothing on
 * the shipper's side can invalidate — so the refusal stranded the enqueue with no act available to
 * clear it. {@link platformFileSet} carries the whole argument, including why this verb enumerates
 * through the platform rather than a git range: the common path here is asserted to read no git at
 * all, and a merge gate needing a fetch to answer is one a checkout-less caller cannot run. The
 * disagreement leaves as a diagnostic line, and the zero-file refusal below is what keeps a
 * conjunction over an unread diff from printing satisfied.
 *
 * **The `13` this verb keeps for that list is the endpoint's own ceiling, not a count comparison.**
 * `pulls/<n>/files` serves at most 3000 files (`PULL_FILES_CAP`) and ends its Link chain normally
 * there, so the pagination proof passes over a list GitHub already truncated. That is a proven
 * partial read rather than two counts disagreeing, and a floor raised from it would be raised over
 * scope nobody saw.
