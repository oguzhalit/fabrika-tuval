/**
 * `ship floor --publish-check` — the same floor, seated on a check-run instead of an exit code.
 *
 * A GitHub Actions job's conclusion is success/failure/cancelled/skipped and nothing else, so while
 * the floor was seated on the job's exit code, "no verdict posted at this head yet" — the ordinary
 * mid-lane state every governance-root PR passes through — showed a human the same red as a verdict
 * that is FAIL or bound to another head. Five of six red open PRs were red on exactly that on
 * one audit, and a red that means "not yet" trains people to stop reading reds.
 *
 * A check-run has the state a job conclusion does not: it can stay `in_progress`. So the absent
 * verdict leaves the check pending, which reads as "waiting" to a human and still withholds a merge
 * — a pending required check is not a passing one, and `ship checks` rolls it up as `pending` rather
 * than green.
 *
 * **The verb writes the check-run; the job only relays what it did** — a workflow's shell relays a
 * verb's answer and never derives the decision itself. Nothing in
 * `governance-floor.yml` decides a conclusion, and nothing here re-derives the floor: the answer is
 * `./floor-verb.ts`'s `resolveFloor`, which is the same derivation the exit-code mode seats.
