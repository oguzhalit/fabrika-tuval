/**
 * The GitHub surface the `ship` verbs read and write, beyond what `../io/pulls.ts` already serves.
 *
 * Two disciplines hold everywhere here and are stated once:
 *
 * - **Every response's status is read before its bytes are interpreted.** A failed read becomes an
 *   explicit `Failure`, never an empty string flowing onward as "nothing found" — roughly a third of
 *   v1's captures skipped this, and every scar in that family is the same omission wearing a
 *   different symptom.
 * - **Every list read pages, and returns its own completeness proof beside what it received.** A
 *   caller that cannot see the proof cannot refuse a truncated read, and a truncated read that
 *   answers anyway is a verdict over unknown scope. Which proof depends on what the platform
 *   declares: an envelope read (`total_count`) proves completeness by the declared count; a bare-array
 *   read (reviews, timeline) declares no count at all, so its proof is **exhausted pagination** — a
 *   terminal page carrying no `rel="next"` link, which the transport now reads off the `Link` header
 *   natively instead of parsing `gh api -i` output back out of a printed status line.
 *
 * The transport is `../io/gh-api.ts`, not a `gh` subprocess. REST throughout, with two of the three
 * carves this package records: the review-thread block at the bottom, and the auto-merge mutation.
 * Neither has a REST route at all. The third is `pullsClosing` in `../io/pulls.ts`.
