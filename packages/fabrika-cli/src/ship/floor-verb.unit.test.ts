/**
 * The floor's whole value is that it refuses on a verdict that is WRONG, not only on one that is
 * MISSING — a guard that fires on absence alone keeps letting the wrong verdict through. So the
 * battery below mutates the verdict four ways that all *look* like a governance verdict is there —
 * FAIL at head, PASS on another head, PASS from an author without write+, a marker in a neighbouring
 * namespace — and asserts each one still reds.
