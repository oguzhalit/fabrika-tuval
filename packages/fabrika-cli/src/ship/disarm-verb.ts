/**
 * `ship disarm` — the four-site merge-intent lifecycle, read-back-verified.
 *
 * **Fail-closed at every indeterminate probe, and the direction is chosen per probe:** an unreadable
 * armed-state reads *armed* (clearing a never-armed intent is a no-op; leaving a parked one is an
 * ungated enqueue the moment the queue opens), and an unreadable queue regime reads
 * *queue-governed* (so a failed read cannot grant the pre-queue keep). The regime is the **base
 * branch's**, never this PR's queue history: a per-PR proxy exempts exactly the parked intent this
 * verb exists to clear.
 *
 * A `disarmed` answer is proven by re-reading `auto_merge` after the write. The disable call's own
 * exit status fuses "it failed" with "nothing was armed" and is never trusted.
 *
 * **There is no `7` seat.** A disarm aimed at a merged or absent PR answers `kept` with the reason —
 * the intent is structurally moot, which is a proven answer. Refusing would make the safety verb the
 * fragile one on exactly the cleanup paths that need it.
