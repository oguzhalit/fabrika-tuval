/**
 * The `ship` verb group — `fabrika ship <verb>`.
 *
 * The adapter and nothing else: it declares the flags (`--help` is the interface, so every flag
 * carries a one-line description), runs the pure verb, and emits its outcome. Every decision lives
 * in the `*-verb.ts` modules beside it, which is what makes each refusal testable without spawning
 * a process.
 *
 * **Every leaf is declared with `leafCommand`, never a bare `Command.make`** — the bare form
 * silently opts out of the excess-operand guard, which `../excess-operand.unit.test.ts` reds on.
