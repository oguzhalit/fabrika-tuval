/**
 * Reading the §CP boundary once, for the two verbs that need it.
 *
 * The ref is the PR's **base branch**, not the PR — a PR must not reclassify itself — and not a
 * literal trunk name either: the base ref is that same branch in this repo and the honest
 * generalization in an adopter repo whose trunk is called something else.
 *
 * A **proven-absent** CODEOWNERS (404) is an empty row set, which classifies as the `unknown` hold.
 * A **failed read** is neither — it is the caller's `11`; collapse the two and a §CP read that
 * failed reports "awaiting approval" instead. Neither answers `not-control-plane`: collapsing
 * `unknown` → `not-control-plane` is the recurring fail-open defect, and `unknown` is the state
 * that holds the PR.
