/**
 * `ship cp-approval` — the §CP approval cardinality discharge, transcribed.
 *
 * Identical single-owner PRs merged in one run and were refused in another while this was judgment.
 * The case table ended that, and this verb **is** that table: roster cardinality in, one of
 * `discharge` / `stop` / `n/a` out, every signal bound to `--sha`.
 *
 * The roster is the union of every owner the boundary's control-plane rows name — GitHub's own
 * any-listed-owner semantics. A team is expanded through the members endpoint; an individual
 * `@login` owner is already a roster entry and no roster is read for it, which is what lets a repo
 * with no org behind it discharge the gate at all.
 *
 * The two collapses this verb refuses to make are the ones v1 shipped. A failed read is never
 * `stop` and never "awaiting approval" — it is `11`. And head-binding is checked here, always,
 * rather than delegated to the ruleset's `dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push`, which has been seen to
 * leave a patch-changing push's approval undismissed.
 *
 * **The §CP classification is taken over the enumerated file list, not over GitHub's `changed_files`.**
 * A list short of that declared count used to refuse at `13`, and this verb gates the control-plane
 * discharge, so the refusal left a §CP merge with no act available to clear it. The count is the
 * stale side — GitHub computes it against a base cached at the PR's last push.
 * {@link platformFileSet} owns that argument; the disagreement leaves as a `scanned` line.
 *
 * **The empty-list refusal below is new, and it is what the retired arm used to cover by accident.**
 * `classify` over no files answers `not-control-plane`, so a zero would have rendered as a discharged
 * §CP boundary rather than as an unread one. The other `13` this verb keeps for that list is the
 * endpoint's own 3000-file ceiling (`PULL_FILES_CAP`), where the Link chain ends as a complete read
 * ends: a control-plane path could sit in the part the platform never served. Its `13` refusals on
 * unexhausted review and comment pagination are untouched — those are the platform's own exhaustion
 * proofs, not a count comparison.
 *
 * **A `stop` over a head that conflicts with its base answers `base-conflicted` instead.** Nobody
 * should be asked to approve bytes the rebase will replace, so a conflicting head is a builder's
 * work, not a person's. Mergeability is read only where the answer would otherwise be `stop`: a
 * discharge never reads it, because `ship enqueue` still refuses a `dirty` head after the approval,
 * so no approval is spent here. An unread or still-indefinite mergeability is `11`, because whether
 * the lane waits on a person or a builder is then unknown.
