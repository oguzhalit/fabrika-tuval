/**
 * `ship note` — the durable stop-path comment.
 *
 * Every non-enqueue path leaves a signal, and this verb is that signal's single sanctioned emitter:
 * a freelanced `gh api -f body=@file` is the bypass class this closes, and a stop with no signal at
 * all is a shipper that died where nobody can see it.
 *
 * Stop-path notes are a **history, not a state** — each run's refusal is its own record — so this
 * posts a new comment rather than upserting one. A note on a closed or merged PR is legal for the
 * same reason: refusals happen at every lifecycle stage and the durable record is the point.
