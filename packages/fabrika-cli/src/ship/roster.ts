/**
 * Who is on the control plane — one read, shared by every verb that needs it.
 *
 * Resolved from `.github/CODEOWNERS` on the repository's default branch, through the same
 * `./codeowners.ts` + `./github.ts` pair `ship cp-approval` uses. **One ACL module, not three.** A
 * second reading of "who is on the control plane" would drift from the one the merge gate enforces,
 * and drift here is an approval nobody with authority gave. It lives beside the merge gate rather
 * than under the group that reached for it first, because both `plan approve` and `decision rule`
 * resolve it and neither owns it.
 *
 * The one collapse this module refuses to make: a roster that could not be read is
 * `Unknown`, never an empty roster and never a permissive one. An empty roster is a *proven* fact and
 * a separate answer.
 *
 * **What the roster proves, exactly.** That the invoking token (on a write) or a marker's author (on
 * a read) is an account the control-plane owners resolve to. It does not prove a human typed the
 * command; nothing mechanical can, and the residue is the same one `build clear` carries. The rule
 * asks for a human behind the control-plane owner, and this is the mechanical half of that. A driver
 * recording a decision on that human's behalf posts from a roster account, so its marker is honoured
 * for the same reason a human-typed one is.
