/**
 * `ship enqueue` — arm the queue's auto-merge at a pinned head, and prove the arm landed.
 *
 * **There is no merge-method flag to pass, by construction.** The queue owns the method, and v1's
 * documented hazard is that a `--squash` alongside `--auto` conflicts with the queue and silently
 * no-ops the enqueue at exit 0. A surface that does not exist cannot be misused.
 *
 * The live head is re-resolved first and drift refuses on `12`: the enqueue is the one action every
 * gate's `--sha` was protecting, so arming at a moved head ships a tree nobody verified.
 *
 * After the arm, `auto_merge: null` is **expected** — the queue consumes the intent — and is never
 * read as a jam. The jam discriminator is the arm's own error response, quoted verbatim on `8`.
 *
 * **Mergeability is asserted BEFORE the arm, and both an indefinite and a definitely-false read
 * refuse.** Probed live on this repo: GitHub *accepts* the arm on a conflicted PR under a
 * queue-governed base and parks the intent on it — no platform-side refusal — so nothing but this
 * precondition stands between a `dirty` PR and a parked intent reported as a healthy `enqueued`.
 * `mergeable` is computed lazily, so `null` is routine and is **not an answer**: it is polled, and a
 * still-indefinite value is UNKNOWN and refuses on `11`. A read that could not produce a definite
 * answer must never resolve to one. A definite `mergeable: false` refuses instead of arming: the
 * conflict is already proven by the read the verb just performed, and arming on it spends an enqueue
 * round plus one of the lane's retries to rediscover it at reconcile.
 *
 * **That refusal splits by cause, on two codes.** A `mergeable_state: dirty` is a fact about the
 * *base* — it moved under the branch — and every other definite not-mergeable value is a fact about
 * the head. The lane charges the two differently (`21` spends a machinery lap, `16` a repair round),
 * so the split is a code rather than a state string a shipper would have to parse. What it does not
 * change is that the repair round happens: a dirty base moves the merge-base blob every verdict's
 * content digest covers (`../review/content-binding.ts`), so every verdict on the PR is void and
 * the re-review is genuinely owed. This verb moves no branch — rebasing the head is the builder's,
 * on a re-reviewed round.
