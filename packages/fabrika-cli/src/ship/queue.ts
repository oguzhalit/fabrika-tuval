/**
 * Reading queue state off the timeline, and reading a landing off the base branch.
 *
 * Two rules here are incident-shaped and neither is negotiable:
 *
 * - **An ejection is a removal NOT paired with a merge.** The queue consuming an entry emits the
 *   same `removed_from_merge_queue` event ≤1s before the merge, so reading the bare removal reports
 *   a false ejection over a PR that landed.
 * - **The base-branch subject match is anchored at the END.** A squashed subject can carry two
 *   parenthesised numbers, and the last one is the PR that landed; a contains-match credits the
 *   other. The timeline itself lags the truth by up to ~65 minutes, which is why the base branch is
 *   cross-checked at all.
