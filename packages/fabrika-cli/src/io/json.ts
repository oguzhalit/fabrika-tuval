/**
 * The JSON boundary — the one native `try/catch` around `JSON.parse` in this package.
 *
 * **No `effect` import here on purpose.** Parsing an untrusted string needs a native `try/catch`,
 * and this package bans that inside Effect control flow — so this is the boundary half, and the
 * Effect seams in `issues.ts` wrap it. A parse that fails never resolves to a value: it is either
 * `null` or a tagged reason, which every caller turns into a typed refusal rather than into an
 * empty result.
