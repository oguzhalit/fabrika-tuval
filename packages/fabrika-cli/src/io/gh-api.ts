/**
 * The GitHub transport every adapter in this package calls: a fetch client over
 * `effect/unstable/http`, not a `gh` subprocess.
 *
 * Two disciplines hold everywhere here and are stated once rather than re-derived per call site:
 *
 * - **Every response's status is read before its bytes are interpreted.** The status arrives as a
 *   number, so `Absent` and `Unknown` are told apart by the platform's own answer instead of by
 *   scraping `(HTTP 404)` out of a `gh` error string, which reads a ported 403 as no status at all.
 * - **Every list read returns its own completeness proof beside what it received.** A caller that
 *   cannot see the proof cannot refuse a truncated read, and a truncated read that answers anyway
 *   is a verdict over unknown scope. Which proof depends on what the platform declares: an envelope
 *   read proves completeness by `total_count`, a bare-array read declares no count at all and its
 *   proof is exhausted pagination — a terminal page carrying no `rel="next"` link.
 *
 * REST throughout, with exactly five carves: {@link graphqlRead} for review threads
 * and their mutations, the auto-merge mutation, `pullsClosing` in `./pulls.ts`, the Projects
 * (v2) client in `./projects.ts`, and the batched issue reads in `./issue-batch.ts`, carved by
 * ruling rather than by a missing REST edge. Issue
 * *search* stays REST — this org's Projects-classic integration errors GraphQL search out.
 *
 * The credential is an argument to every leg *of this module*, never something a leg resolves —
 * {@link resolveToken} is the one producer, and a caller holding no `token` cannot construct a
 * request at all. Adapters outside this file take `(repo, …)` and reach {@link ambientToken} for
 * theirs, and they erase the transport requirement with {@link onTransport} rather than publishing
 * `HttpClient` up through every verb annotation.
