/**
 * The GitHub surface the `report` and `triage` verbs read and write: the intake queue, the search
 * index, the repository's label set and open milestones, and the issue/comment writes plus their
 * read-backs.
 *
 * Everything goes through `./gh-api.ts` REST and **never GraphQL** — the org's Projects-classic
 * integration errors out the GraphQL issue *search* connection, which is what this module's reads
 * are — and **every list read pages** and refuses a walk it could not prove whole: an unpaginated or
 * capped read is a silently short answer, which for a duplicate check is a false `none`.
 *
 * Two disciplines this module exists to make unavoidable:
 *
 * - **Absent and unreadable are different outcomes.** {@link Existence} splits them on the numeric
 *   status the response carried. A caller may only seat a proven "does not exist" refusal on
 *   `Absent`; `Unknown` refuses on its own code with nothing on stdout.
 * - **A shape that is not what was asked for is a failure, never an empty result.** Every read
 *   validates before anything interprets, because a 200 can carry something else entirely.

 * Every comment on `issue`, reconciled against the count the issue declares for itself.

 * lane that has in fact lost: on 2026-09-05 a `triage claim` read one comment, did not see a marker
 * that had been live for three minutes, and answered `won` — the read was stale, the rule over it
 * was correct, and a whole triage pass was spent on somebody else's issue.
 *
 * GitHub documents no read-after-write guarantee for the REST API and no cache-bypass directive: its
 * REST best-practices page offers only `etag`/`last-modified` conditional requests, whose answer is
 * "unchanged since the value *you* saved", which proves nothing about a write another lane made
 * ([GitHub, "Best practices for using the REST API", §Use conditional requests / §Make requests that
 * can be cached](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28)).
 * So consistency is not requested here, it is **proven**: the issue payload's own `comments` field
 * is the denominator, and a list shorter than it is a read that provably missed something. Verified
 * live on 2026-09-10 against a real issue: the payload's `comments` and the comments endpoint's
 * length agreed. The wider shape is
 * [.patterns/github-read-completeness-proofs.md](../../../../.patterns/github-read-completeness-proofs.md).
 *
 * The list is read first and the count second, so the count is strictly the later fact and
 * `length < declared` cannot be explained by a comment posted after the count was taken. A shortfall
 * is re-read on a linear backoff, and a shortfall that survives every attempt is a
 * {@link Attempt} failure — never a shorter list handed on, which is the fail-open shape the claim
 * resolver cannot see through.
 *
 * `length > declared` is not fenced: a comment deleted between the two reads produces it, and a list
 * carrying *extra* markers can only make the claim resolver more cautious. A payload carrying no
 * `comments` field reads as `0` and fences nothing, which is the direction {@link IssueRecord}
 * already states for that field — the proof is absent, so nothing is proven either way.
 *
 * Bounds are overridable with `FABRIKA_COMMENT_SCAN_ATTEMPTS` and `FABRIKA_COMMENT_SCAN_DELAY_MS`,
 * which is how a test drives the retry without waiting on a real clock.
