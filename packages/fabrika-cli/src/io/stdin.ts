/**
 * The fd-0 boundary — a body arrives as bytes, and a pipe that could not be read is never empty.
 *
 * The read is a raw `node:fs` `readSync` on purpose, which is the standing ruling in
 * [.patterns/effect-platform-access.md](../../../../.patterns/effect-platform-access.md)
 * (§"The bright line" — fd 0 stays a raw read at the boundary; `Stdio.stdin` is a
 * considered-and-declined stream swap, not a missing service). **No `effect` import here**, for the
 * same reason: the retry loop needs a native `try/catch` around each `readSync`, which is banned
 * inside Effect control flow. The CLI adapter lifts {@link readStdin} into an effect, and
 * the verbs take that effect as an option — so a test drives the `EAGAIN` and TTY paths without a
 * real descriptor.
 *
 * **`Text("")` and `Failed` are different answers and must never collapse.** A non-blocking pipe
 * throws `EAGAIN` before its producer writes, and swallowing that to `""` makes an unread pipe
 * byte-identical to an empty one — the caller then decides over evidence it never saw, which is the
 * same fail-open a guard commits when it answers over zero scope. The read is implemented here
 * rather than imported from an older tree, so the lesson is duplicated as behaviour, not as a
 * dependency.
