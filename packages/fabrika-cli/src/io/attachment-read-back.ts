/**
 * The one read-back of a GitHub user-attachment upload, shared by `ui evidence` and
 * `review-ui post`: an upload is evidence only once GitHub serves its exact bytes back.
 *
 * LOAD-BEARING NOTE — a fresh `github.com/user-attachments/assets/<uuid>` is NOT readable at its own
 * URL. Probed live on 2026-09-23: the upload answers `201 {"url": …}`, and that URL reads `404`
 * with `authorization: token`, with `Bearer` and anonymously, right away and minutes later, while
 * an asset some posted comment already embeds answers `302`. The bytes are stored, though: GitHub's
 * renderer, asked to render `![…](<url>)` in this repo's context, rewrites a stored asset into a
 * signed `private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/…-<uuid>.png?jwt=…` link that serves `200` with
 * the uploaded bytes, and leaves an unknown uuid as a plain unsigned link. That signed link is also
 * exactly what a posted comment's rendered HTML embeds, so it is what a human opening the PR loads.
 *
 * So the read-back is: render the URL, take the signed `<img>` whose path names this asset's uuid,
 * fetch it anonymously, and require `200` plus the local capture's exact bytes. The token goes to
 * the GitHub API only; the served-asset host never sees it. Anything short of that — a non-`200`,
 * other bytes, no signed link, a transport fault — is a failure reason, never a pass.
 *
