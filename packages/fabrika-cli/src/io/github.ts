/**
 * The GitHub half of the in-flight read: which open pull requests already claim a decision-record id.
 *
 * Reads go through the `gh-api` client's REST leg and **never GraphQL** — the org's Projects-classic
 * integration errors out GraphQL issue queries — and **every list read pages**: a pull request that
 * adds its record file past the first page of its file list still claims its number, so a single
 * unpaginated page is a silently short answer, not a shorter one.
 *
 * Both reads below validate the SHAPE of what arrived before anything interprets it, and refuse a
 * payload that is not it. That discipline predates the port and survives it: a permissive read would
 * turn a wrong-shape payload into an empty in-flight set — which a caller reads as "nothing
 * reserved", the exact collision this module exists to remove.
