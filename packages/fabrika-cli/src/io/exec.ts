/**
 * The one subprocess seam — `git` and `gh` spawned through `ChildProcess` / `ChildProcessSpawner`
 * from `effect/unstable/process`, per
 * [.patterns/effect-process-cli-shell.md](../../../../.patterns/effect-process-cli-shell.md). The
 * platform spawner is the substitutable seam, so a unit test scripts the *service* rather than a
 * hand-rolled function double, and `run.ts`'s `NodeServices.layer` is what satisfies it in the bin.
 *
 * Every caller reads `ok` before `stdout`. That is the whole discipline this file exists to make
 * unavoidable: a failed invocation returns empty `stdout`, and empty `stdout` is byte-identical to
 * a successful invocation that found nothing. Interpreting bytes without first reading the status
 * is how a check comes to answer a plausible value instead of an error.
 *
 * A non-zero exit is **data**, not a failure on the `E` channel — `git rev-parse` on a ref that does
 * not resolve is an outcome this package turns into a specific exit code, not an exception. A spawn
 * fault (`gh` absent from `PATH`) arrives as a `PlatformError` and folds into the same record, so
 * `E` is `never` and the status lives in `ok`.
