/**
 * GitHub's **native** relationship endpoints: the sub-issue link and the two issue-dependency
 * lists. The frontier's topology is stored here rather than in a map body, so this is the one path
 * to it — a second path is what let v1's prose topology drift from the graph it described.
 *
 * The `issues.ts` disciplines hold unchanged: REST and never GraphQL, every list read paged, absent
 * split from unreadable through {@link Existence}, and a shape that is not what was asked for
 * treated as a failure rather than an empty result.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: 404-IS-A-VERDICT --> **A 404 on a dependency read is a verdict about the issue, not
 * about its edges.** These endpoints answer `200 []` for a real issue with no edges and `404` for an
 * issue that does not exist, so the two are distinguishable — but only if existence is established
 * separately. A caller that read `[]` and reported "no blocking edges" without knowing the issue
 * exists would print a proven negative over zero scope, which is why every read
 * here answers `Absent` on a 404 instead of an empty list.
 *
 * <!-- anchor: EDGE-BODY-TAKES-AN-INTERNAL-ID --> **Both POST bodies take the target's internal
 * `id`, not its issue number**, and the sub-issue key is the singular `sub_issue_id`. Passing a
 * number silently addresses a different issue, so the writes below take an id and the caller resolves
 * it with `getIssue` rather than interpolating a number.
 *
 * **Pagination is load-bearing, not hygiene.** An unpaginated `blocked_by` read returns a plausible
 * first page, so a frontier that "looks clear" at 30 edges would be reported clear with nothing
 * marking it wrong — the fail-open direction.
