/**
 * The filesystem seam — Effect's `FileSystem` / `Path` services, per
 * [.patterns/effect-platform-access.md](../../../../.patterns/effect-platform-access.md). The whole
 * filesystem is the substitutable seam, so a unit test provides a scripted `FileSystem` layer
 * instead of a hand-rolled double, and `run.ts`'s `NodeServices.layer` is what satisfies it.
 *
 * **"I could not read this" is a failure, never an empty value.** An unreadable directory that came
 * back as `[]` would be indistinguishable from a directory that is genuinely empty, and the two take
 * opposite branches: one is a refusal, the other (for `adr new`) is fine. The platform's
 * `PlatformError` is lowered here into a tagged {@link ReadFailed} / {@link WriteFailed}, so that
 * discrimination rides the `E` channel — a caller cannot reach the value without deciding what to do
 * with the failure, where a `null` sentinel could simply go untested.
