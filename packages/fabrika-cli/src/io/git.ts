 * the same defect a guard reds on: a scope nobody chose, read as an answer.

 * Why a merge-base read named nothing, in the words that carry a remedy when there is one.

 * A shallow clone's graft boundary is the one cause of this an operator can repair without touching
 * a ref, a blocker or an issue: every traversal treats the boundary commit as a root, so a common
 * ancestor beyond it is unreachable and {@link mergeBase} names nothing rather than erroring (the
 * same split {@link traversedParents} documents). Reported as a generic reason, it costs a
 * supervisor round-trip diagnosing history depth from outside the verb.
 *
 * **Git's own reason is never dropped, and the shallow clause is a hypothesis beside it.** The probe
 * answers "is this clone shallow", which is a strictly weaker fact than "the shallowness is why
 * merge-base named nothing" — an absent trunk ref and an unrelated-histories pair fail here too, and
 * a shallow CI checkout is exactly where the first is likeliest. Asserting the cause would hand the
 * operator a confident wrong diagnosis and lose the one piece of evidence that corrects it. A probe
 * that itself fails drops the clause entirely: this names an unreadable read more precisely, and
 * never turns one into a readable one.
 *
 * It lives here, beside the two reads it composes, so a third merge-base seam cannot be written
 * without the diagnosis — the generic reason survived in `build reap` for exactly as long as the
 * helper was private to one caller.
