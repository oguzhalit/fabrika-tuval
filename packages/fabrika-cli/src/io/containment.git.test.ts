/**
 * The containment read driven against **real git**, over a **real squash landing**.
 *
 * The claim under test is a claim about what git does — that a squash-merged branch's head is not an
 * ancestor of the trunk, and that its cumulative patch id nevertheless equals the trunk commit's —
 * so it is run rather than reasoned about (CLAUDE.md: ground platform claims in source or in a real
 * run). A merge-commit fixture proves nothing here: `merge-base --is-ancestor` already answers those,
 * and it is exactly the squash shape it cannot answer.
 *
 * `execCapture` spawns in the process's own working directory, so the fixture is entered with
 * `process.chdir` and the runner's directory is put back in `afterEach`. That is the one way to
 * drive the shipped Effect reader itself rather than a re-typed copy of its argv.
