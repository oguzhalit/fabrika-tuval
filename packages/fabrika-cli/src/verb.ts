/**
 * What every fabrika verb returns, and the exit codes it may seat an answer on.
 *
 * A verb is a **pure function of its dependencies** — it computes an outcome, it does not write
 * streams or exit. The CLI adapter does both. That split is what makes a verb's refusals as
 * deterministically testable as its answers: a test asserts the exit code and the bytes on each
 * channel without spawning a process.
 *
 * Reserved codes belong to `claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/interface-convention.md`.
 *
 * A verdict a verb PROVED must never share an exit code with a failure to invoke: `1` is what the
 * Effect CLI returns for a bad flag and what a failed module load returns, so a proven refusal
 * seated there is unreadable as proof — `[ $? -ne 0 ]` would read "never ran" as "ran and proved
 * it".

/**
 * `fabrika` started and could not reach a working set of verbs — an unlinked dependency, a
 * repo-local install it could not execute, a cwd it refuses to answer from.
 *
 * **Seated at `126` because `2` blocks a tool call, and this state may never block one.** A
 * `PreToolUse` hook's exit `2` is the harness's *one* code for "block the tool call"
 * (`hook/harness-exit.ts`), so while this state sat there a fabrika that could not bootstrap
 * blocked every `Task`/`Workflow` spawn in the session — the exact inverse of the ruled polarity for
 * a hook whose verb never ran, which is to fail open.
 *
 * `126` rather than the `3`+ band because this is not a verb's proven outcome and no group owns it:
 * every group's `3`+ band is already occupied by facts of its own (`3` is `EMPTY_STDIN` across the
 * aligned tables), and seating a bootstrap failure on one of those would collapse "I could not
 * start" into "I started and read nothing" — the collapse `hook/codes.ts` exists to prevent. `126`
 * is the shell's own *found but not executable*, the same claim one level up, and it sits beside
 * `127` so the two invocation failures read as one band.
