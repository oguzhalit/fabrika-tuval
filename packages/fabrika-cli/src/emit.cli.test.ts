/**
 * The half of `emit` only a real subprocess can prove: an answer bigger than the pipe buffer arrives
 * whole.
 *
 * Nothing in-process can catch this. The defect was `process.exit` running before the OS pipe had
 * drained, so it needs a real process, a real pipe, and an answer past the buffer — under those
 * three the pre-fix build returned 65,536 of 3,795,600 bytes on exit 0. An assertion on the
 * *shape* of stdout passes against that bug; the assertions here are byte-exact.
 *
 * `wire emit` is the producer because its answer scales with stdin, it touches no network, and its
 * composition is a pure function this file can call directly for the expected bytes.
