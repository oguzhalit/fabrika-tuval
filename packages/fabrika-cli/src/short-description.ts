/**
 * The rule for a leaf verb's short list-row description — one string, mechanically checkable.
 *
 * Effect's help renderer reads one description for two audiences: the parent group's `SUBCOMMANDS`
 * row and the verb's own `DESCRIPTION` block. The convention
 * (`claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/cli-interface-convention.md` §1) makes the block the full contract —
 * shape, exit codes, an example — so reusing it as the list row emitted rows over a thousand
 * characters, unwrapped and untruncated. `Command.withShortDescription` adds the row's own
 * string without touching the contract, and this module is what keeps it a row.
 *
 * The budget is derived from the renderer, not chosen: `renderTable` (`effect@4.0.0-beta.92`,
 * `src/unstable/cli/CliOutput.ts`) prefixes two spaces and pads the name column to
 * `min(longestName + 4, 20)`, so the right column starts at column 22 and 78 columns are left at a
 * 100-column terminal. 72 keeps a margin for a longer verb name landing later.

/**
 * Every way a short description fails the rule, named — an empty list is the pass.
 *
 * Reported as a list rather than a boolean so the test that reds tells the author which rule broke.
