/**
 * Whose pull request this is — the one answer `build` (repair), `ship` (enqueue, merge) and
 * `heal-ci` (routing) read before they drive a PR.
 *
 * A pull request belongs to its author. It is the pipeline's to drive when its author is one of the
 * repo's own accounts (`ownAccounts`, or the running account alone when that set is empty), or when
 * an account the repo trusts to grant has handed it over with a takeover grant. Anything else is
 * `Foreign`, and a foreign PR is its author's to finish.
 *
 * Pure: the reads live in `./read.ts`. Everything here takes facts that were already read in full,
 * so each clause is a test over values, and an unreadable input never reaches this module.
