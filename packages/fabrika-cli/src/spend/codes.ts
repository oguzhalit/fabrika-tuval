/**
 * The one exit table every `spend` verb allocates from, so a code means one thing across the group.
 *
 * `spend read` and `spend rollup` already drew the same distinctions — an input that is not there,
 * an input that could not be read, an input read in full that carries nothing — they just spelled
 * them as seven per-verb constants on two overlapping number lines. The names below are the
 * group's, so a caller reading `$?` gets the fact without first asking which verb produced it; the
 * stderr line still names the transcript or the ledger.
 *
 * The two shared seats are **imported from the base, never re-typed** — the discipline
 * `../exit-code-alignment.ts` can check. `12` and up are this group's own.
 *
 * **A measurement that could not be made never resolves to a plausible zero**, which is why the
 * three zero-shaped states stay three codes: {@link INPUT_ABSENT} is a proven absence,
 * {@link INPUT_UNREADABLE} is UNKNOWN, and {@link NOTHING_MEASURED} is a read that succeeded and
 * found nothing billed. Collapsing any pair would hand a caller a total it cannot trust.
 *
 * `0`, `1` and `127` are reserved by the interface convention (`../verb.ts`). No code here varies
 * with the size of a spend: a spend verb reports a measurement, it never gates on one.
