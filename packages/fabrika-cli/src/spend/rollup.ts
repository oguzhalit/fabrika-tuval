/**
 * Historical version-1 rollup. Native response/category summaries live in usage-rollup.ts.
 *
 * Pure and total: it takes what {@link readSpendLedger} already produced and a resolved window, and
 * returns the answer. Nothing here reads a file, spawns anything, or re-parses a transcript — the
 * rows were measured when the runs finished, and this only adds them up.
 *
 * **Every number it cannot count is a number it reports.** A total that quietly omits the lines it
 * could not read, or the runs it could not place in time, is worse than an error: it is wrong and
 * looks right. So the unread halves ride out on the answer next to the total, split the way
 * {@link LedgerSkips} splits them, and a bounded window names how many rows it could not date.
