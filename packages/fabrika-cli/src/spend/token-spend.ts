/**
 * fabrika's token meter — reconstruct one run's billed token spend from its transcript, offline.
 *
 * The formula is **specified, not chosen**: billed spend is fixed as the sum of the four `usage`
 * components over every `assistant` message, because Claude Code persists only those per-message
 * components into a transcript and never its own `cost.total_tokens` aggregate.
 *
 *   billed = Σ (input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens
 *             + cache_read_input_tokens + output_tokens)
 *
 * This lives here rather than being imported because fabrika re-implements what it needs instead of
 * reaching into v1: duplication is the accepted price of keeping v1 deletable. The two-rulers risk
 * that duplication would otherwise carry is closed by a **shared committed fixture** —
 * `fixtures/one-ruler/transcript.jsonl` plus its expected figures, asserted by this package's unit
 * tier *and* by v1's `token-spend` tier, so both implementations are pinned to one set of numbers
 * rather than trusted to agree.
 *
 * `cache_read` stays visible on its own because it is the cumulative cached prefix re-reported every
 * turn: it dominates `billed` and grows with turn count, which is itself the context-bloat signal.
 * `exCacheRead` is the cross-run comparator that does not re-count it.
 *
 * Pure and total. A line that is not JSON, is not an assistant message, or carries no `usage` is
 * skipped rather than thrown on — a missed message undercounts, it never aborts a measurement.
 *
 * `classifyRunSpend` at the bottom is the other half of the same rule: what a transcript's spend
 * *is* when it cannot be reconstructed. It reads as a spend rule, not an eval one, so it lives here
 * with its own ingredients — every consumer (`eval/`, `spend read`) imports it from this one owner.
