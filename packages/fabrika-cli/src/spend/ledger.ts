/**
 * The durable spend ledger — where a measured run's cost survives the shell that measured it.
 *
 * Before this, a spend row existed only for as long as the operator kept the `--out` file they
 * named, so every measurement was ephemeral. The ledger is **JSON Lines**: one self-describing JSON
 * object per line, appended, never rewritten. The format is chosen for what a partial write does to
 * it — a crash mid-line damages exactly that line, and the reader below skips it — and for what
 * evolution does to it: every line carries its own `v`, so a later shape is a new version rather
 * than a migration of the file.
 *
 * The one-way import edge is deliberate: this module reaches `spend/` and `io/` only, never
 * `eval/`. `LedgerRow` is therefore declared **structurally** rather than imported from the
 * runner — `eval`'s `SpendRow` satisfies it, and so does a synthetic row in a test — which is
 * what lets the roll-up read this ledger without depending on the eval harness that writes it.

 * `v: 1` row starts counting as `malformed` and drops out of the roll-up — the operator is told their

 * same change, what an older intact row becomes: decode it into a {@link LedgerRow}, or count it under
 * a skip of its own that every {@link LedgerSkips} reader renders. Until one of those lands the bump
