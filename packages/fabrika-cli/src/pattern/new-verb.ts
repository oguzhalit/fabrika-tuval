/**
 * `pattern new` — scaffold one doc from the canonical template.
 *
 * Not a judging verb: it writes exactly one file and never edits another. The index row is
 * `pattern register`'s, and separating them is what lets a doc land in a repo whose index is
 * missing. Creating `--dir` when it is absent is the bootstrap half of the same rule — a repo
 * adopting fabrika has no `.patterns/`, and its first doc has to be writable on the documented path.
