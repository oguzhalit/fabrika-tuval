/**
 * The four git reads this group needs beyond `../io/git.ts`'s — presence in a tree, and history over
 * a path.
 *
 * **Presence is probed with a pathspec, never with a read that fails on absence.** `git ls-tree
 * --name-only <sha> -- <path>` exits `0` whether or not the path is there and prints it only when it
 * is, so "not in the tree" is a *fact* and a non-zero exit is a *failed read*. That split is what
 * lets `pattern corpus` answer `absent` at exit `0` while still refusing `11` on a read it could not
 * perform — the two would be one answer if absence were inferred from a failure.
 *
 * Every probe below is `--full-tree`, which is what keeps that split honest: git resolves a bare
 * pathspec against the process's directory and limits the listing to it, so from a subdirectory a
 * present path answers empty and reads as the *fact* of absence. It implies `--full-name`,
 * so the printed names stay root-relative and comparable to the paths asked about.
