/**
 * The fixture bytes the contract's worked examples are stated against, scripted onto the git seam.
 *
 * The examples name fixtures committed under `packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/`, and the
 * read-at-`--base` rule
 * applies to them like anything else — so what a verb actually sees is `git show <sha>:<path>`
 * output. Scripting **those bytes** reproduces the examples through the same seam production uses,
 * and it does so without a checkout: a test that shelled out to a real repository would be asserting
 * against that repository's history rather than against the spec.
 *
 * The bytes are read FROM the fixture files, never copied beside them. A copy is a fact that
 * goes stale without telling anyone — `PLAIN_DOC` shipped 93 bytes against a 179-byte file and
 * nothing red — so the file on disk is the one source, and a fixture that moved or emptied fails the
 * read loudly rather than scripting the seam with nothing.
 *
 * What each fixture is for is stated in the fixture's own opening prose; read the file rather than a
 * gloss of it here.
