/**
 * `pattern anchor` — whether the dependency version a doc declares still matches what the workspace
 * pins.
 *
 * A separate verb rather than a mode of `pattern drift` because the git half and the dependency half
 * go stale independently. **An unreadable manifest is UNKNOWN and never `unpinned`:** the two are one
 * keystroke apart in consequence — `unpinned` says the repo does not carry this dependency, and a
 * failed read says nothing at all. A manifest that is genuinely absent, or that carries neither `catalog:` nor `catalogs:`
 * keys, is the degrade path instead: every declaration reports `unpinned` at exit `0` with the
 * absence named on stderr. A manifest that *does* carry a catalog this reader cannot comprehend is
 * UNKNOWN, never that degrade path. Conflicting pins refuse only when the doc declares that package.
