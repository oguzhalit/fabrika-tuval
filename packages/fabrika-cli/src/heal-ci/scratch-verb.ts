/**
 * `heal-ci scratch` — the per-lane scratch path a healer writes its note bodies under.
 *
 * `<temp root>/fabrika-heal-ci/<session-id>/<pr>/<slug>`. Two healers running the same sweep derived
 * similar working filenames in one working directory and overwrote each other's note bodies
 * mid-post, which is the failure `build scratch` and `triage scratch` already exist to make
 * unconstructible.
 *
 * **The session id is this group's lane nonce, and the PR number is its lane.** The sibling
 * allocators key on a claim nonce because a build or triage fan-out runs many lanes under one
 * session id, so the session alone hands them all one directory. This group has no claim verb and no
 * fan-out: `heal-ci` runs as a forked shell per invocation, so two concurrent healers are two
 * sessions, and within one session the PR under repair is what separates one row of a sweep from the
 * next. Both halves of the key are therefore already in the path, and inventing a nonce for a lane
 * identity that does not exist would key the namespace on a value nothing else in the run can
 * reproduce.
 *
 * The printed path is machine-local and must never reach a posted artifact — `heal-ci note` reds on
 * one (`5`), which is what makes the rule enforced rather than advisory.
