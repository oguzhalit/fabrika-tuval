/**
 * The failure-signature taxonomy: a closed, **ordered** table of eleven rows, and the default-deny
 * lookup over it.
 *
 * The order is part of the contract, not an implementation detail — the classes genuinely overlap
 * (an OOM-killed suite prints assertion output before it dies, and a preview target answering `502`
 * matches both a warmup row and a generic network row), so the first matching row wins and specific
 * rows precede general ones. Transient rows precede logic rows so an infrastructure death is not
 * read as the assertion failure it printed on its way down.
 *
 * The one `derived` row is last. It is the only row whose match says the log holds no failure of
 * its own, so every row that names a real failure must be able to beat it: a roll-up that also
 * printed a defect is that defect. A row added later goes above it.
 *
 * The table grows by adding a row, never by branching inside a verb: it is data, under unit test
 * against fixture logs.
 *
 * A secret scanner's committed-secret finding is deliberately not a row. It stays `unclassified`
 * so it reaches a person who removes the secret and rotates the credential; a `logic` row would
 * hand a repair lane a pull request carrying a live secret.

/**
 * `derived` is a log that only restates another job's verdict. It is not `unclassified`, which
