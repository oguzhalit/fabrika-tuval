/**
 * `heal-ci rerun` — the at-most-once transient rerun, precondition re-derived **inside the verb**.
 *
 * The guard is the single most important clause in this group's contract, and it lives here because
 * v1's counterpart accepted no already-rerun input and performed no check of its own: the whole
 * one-rerun invariant rested on the model remembering a number it had read several steps earlier. A
 * session-memory invariant is not an invariant, so a caller that has convinced itself a second rerun
 * is warranted still cannot get one.
 *
 * Steps 4-6 are one logical operation whose ordering is deliberate: the rerun before the marker means
 * an interrupted run leaves a re-runnable state rather than a permanently blocked one, and the
 * read-back is what makes the marker true.
 *
 * The signature's class is re-derived here too: the budget is one rerun per head, so spending it on
 * a red a retry cannot change leaves the pull request less healable than before the call.
 *
 * This verb takes no view on whether the rerun is wise — where the failing context is itself a gate
 * checking its own output a bounded retry can be actively harmful; that judgment is the
 * skill's and is exercised before this verb is called.
