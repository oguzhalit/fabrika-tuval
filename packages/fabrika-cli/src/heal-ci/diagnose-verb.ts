/**
 * `heal-ci diagnose` — one PR's stall class, with the evidence that proves it.
 *
 * The classification itself is `./stall.ts`, pure and ordered; this module is the read set it runs
 * over and the line grammar it prints. Every read splits proven-absent from could-not-read, and a
 * read that could not complete is `11` or `13` — **never** a class, and never `attended`.
 *
 * The reads are exposed as {@link diagnoseOne} so `heal-ci sweep` classifies through this same chain
 * rather than a second one.
 *
 * **The changed-file read is one exception to that, and it reports rather than refuses.** GitHub's
 * `changed_files` on the pull-request record is computed against a base cached at the last push, so
 * a file list short of it says nothing about the list's completeness — and this is the verb an
 * operator reaches for when a PR is already stuck, which is the worst place to keep a refusal a
 * stuck PR can trigger. The disagreement leaves as a notice
 * ({@link platformFileSet}); an **empty** list still refuses, because every classification
 * downstream would otherwise read clean over a diff nothing was read from. The check-run shortfall
 * below is a different proof and still refuses: `total_count` and the enumerated runs come from one
 * read of one endpoint, so a shortfall there really is a truncated page.
 *
 * **The changed-file read keeps one `13` of its own, the endpoint's ceiling.** `pulls/<n>/files`
 * serves at most 3000 files (`PULL_FILES_CAP`) and ends its Link chain normally there, so the
 * pagination proof passes over a list GitHub already truncated. That is a fact about the read
 * itself, not two counts disagreeing, and every classification below derives from the file set.
