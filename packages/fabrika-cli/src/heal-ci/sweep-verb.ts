/**
 * `heal-ci sweep` — every open PR classified with its strand age, the scheduled surface.
 *
 * **This verb writes nothing.** It files no issue, assigns nobody and spawns nothing: a detector
 * converts a strand into claimable work and normal pull adopts it.
 *
 * A board report with an unnamed hole in it is the false completeness this verb exists to prevent,
 * so a single unclassifiable PR fails the whole sweep rather than being silently dropped, and a
 * rate limit exhausted mid-scan refuses with nothing partial emitted.
 *
 * The lane comes from ./lane.ts so the scheduled workflow relays the route instead of deriving it
 * in shell. See ./command.ts help for the row format.
