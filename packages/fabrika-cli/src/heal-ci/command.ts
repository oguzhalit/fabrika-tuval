/**
 * The `heal-ci` verb group — `fabrika heal-ci <diagnose|sweep|surface|logs|classify|rerun|note|scratch>`,
 * the `heal-ci` skill's repair lane.
 *
 * The adapter and nothing else: it declares the flags (`--help` is the interface, so every flag
 * carries a one-line description), runs the pure verb, and emits its outcome. Every decision lives in
 * the `*-verb.ts` modules beside it, which is what makes each refusal testable without spawning a
 * process.
 *
 * **Every leaf is declared with `leafCommand`, never a bare `Command.make`** — the bare form silently
 * opts out of the excess-operand guard, which `../excess-operand.unit.test.ts` reds on.
 *
 * `--sha` defaults to the empty string rather than being optional, and the verbs read that as "the
 * live head": a caller that passes the flag gets it bound and prefix-matched, and one that omits it
 * never reaches the matching logic at all.
