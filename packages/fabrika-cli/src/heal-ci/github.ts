/**
 * The GitHub surface this group reads and writes beyond what `../io/pulls.ts` and `../ship/github.ts`
 * already serve — the protection surface, the job logs, and the rerun request.
 *
 * Two of these are the only genuinely new IO in the group: **fetching a workflow job's log text**
 * and **requesting a rerun**. Everything else composes shipped modules, and the pagination proofs
 * are `../io/gh-api.ts`'s, imported rather than re-derived.
 *
 * The disciplines are the shipped ones, restated nowhere: every response's status is read before its
 * bytes, and proven-absent is split from could-not-read at every seam. Since the port off the `gh`
 * subprocess the status is a number the response carried rather than a code scraped out of an error
 * string, so `Absent` and `Unknown` are told apart by the platform's own answer.
 *
 * **Where the credential comes from.** Every export takes `(repo, …)` and reaches `ambientToken` for
 * its credential, erasing the transport requirement with `onTransport` rather than publishing
 * `HttpClient` up through its callers — the shape every transport seam in this package takes.
