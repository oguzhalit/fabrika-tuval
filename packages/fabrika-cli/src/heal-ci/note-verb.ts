/**
 * `heal-ci note` — the durable stop-path comment, suppressed per `<pr>:<class>:<head>`.
 *
 * An invisible strand is the whole defect this skill exists to remove, so a lane that stops without
 * a record leaves the next reader with nothing. Each classification is its own record — a strand's
 * history is a history, not a state — so this posts a **new** comment rather than upserting one, and
 * a note on a closed or merged PR is legal: a strand that resolved while the run was classifying it
 * still deserves the record.
 *
 * What is *not* its own record is the same classification of the same head by a second caller.
 * Before creating, this reads the pull request's whole comment history and refuses `14` on a comment
 * already carrying the key — the suppression that used to live in `heal-ci-sweep.yml`'s `run:` block,
 * moved into the verb so every note path inherits it and the workflow relays a decision instead of
 * deriving one. The key's format and its reader live in `note-key.ts`.
 *
 * The leak predicate and the stdin fence are `../ship/authored.ts`'s, imported: this group scans the
 * text a session authored, and scanning *landed* content is `leak-guard.yml`'s enforced seam.
