/**
 * The note suppression key: one format, written and read by `heal-ci note`.
 *
 * A strand's history is a history, so `note` posts a new comment per classification — but "per
 * classification" and "per caller" are not the same thing. Two sweeps three minutes apart at one
 * head with one class produced up to six substantively identical notes on a single pull request,
 * because nothing on either side of the write knew the other had already recorded it.
 * The key `<pr>:<class>:<head>` is what makes the record idempotent: one key earns exactly one note
 * for as long as the pull request is open, and a strand is re-noticed only when its class changes or
 * a new commit lands — the two events that make the earlier note stale.
 *
 * The suppression used to live in `.github/workflows/heal-ci-sweep.yml`'s `run:` block, which built
 * the key, paged the comments and globbed for a hit. That deduped the scheduled path and left every
 * other caller posting bare, and it left the workflow deriving a decision rather than relaying a
 * verb's answer, which a workflow's shell must never do. Moving it here fixes both, and every note
 * path inherits it.
 *
 * It is deliberately **not** `marker.ts`'s shape, and the two readers cannot see
 * each other's marker: this one is an HTML comment matched as a whole line anywhere in the body, the
 * rerun marker is a bare `heal-ci-rerun:` line matched on line one only. A note recording a
 * `RERUN-QUEUED` terminal carries this key and names the same head at the same moment, so an
 * overlapping matcher would read the skill's own narration as the at-most-once rerun marker and
 * refuse every first rerun.
