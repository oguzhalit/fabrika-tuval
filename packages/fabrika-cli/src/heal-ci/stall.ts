/**
 * The stall classification: an **ordered, total** predicate chain over facts already read.
 *
 * First match wins, and the order is the contract — two implementers walking it in a different order
 * produce different answers on the same PR, which is exactly the drift a prose taxonomy invites. It
 * is pure so the whole taxonomy is testable without a repository.
 *
 * The chain has two phases, and the split is what makes totality provable. Arms 1-7 are
 * attention-independent: they name states that block the PR no matter who is watching. Arms 8-11 are
 * the attendance phase, reached only once the PR is otherwise able to proceed, so the only remaining
 * question is whether anybody is moving it.
