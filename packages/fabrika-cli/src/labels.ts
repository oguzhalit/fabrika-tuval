 * Every `status:` and `class:` label the pipeline writes, named once.
 *
 * These lived as a private `const` inside each writing verb, and `status bootstrap label-taxonomy`
 * held a fourth copy of two of them and none of the other three — so a bootstrapped repo got five of
 * the sixteen labels the verbs require and could not triage, park, flip a plan or mark a dark ship
 * One name in one place is what makes the bootstrap's set derivable rather than restated.
 *
 * The *facet* vocabularies — `TYPES`, `PRIORITIES`, `AUDIENCES` — stay in `triage/facets.ts`,
 * because those are decode targets for a flag as well as label stems; this file holds only the
 * names that are labels and nothing else. Standing lanes are in neither: a repo declares its own.
