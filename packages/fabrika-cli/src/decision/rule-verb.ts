/**
 * `decision rule` — record a control-plane human's ruling on one issue, and hand a parked issue
 * back to the agent lane.
 *
 * **The subject is any issue, and that is the newer half.** A founder ruling lands wherever the work
 * is, and recorded as prose it changed nothing about what any gate graded — the defect
 * `../review/graded-set.ts` tells. Recorded through this verb it is a marker `review criteria` folds
 * into the graded set and `lane prove` dates a verdict against.
 * `--supersedes <k>` is how the ruling says which body criterion it replaces — the only mechanical
 * statement of contradiction there is, because no verb can read the prose and judge that itself.
 *
 * @ruling https://github.com/kamp-us/phoenix/issues/9517#issuecomment-5752597880
 *
 * **The audience flip follows the subject to every type but `type:epic`.** Triage parks a bug or a
 * feature on `ready-for:human` for a founder call as readily as a decision, and this verb is the one
 * sanctioned flip back: the marker it proves first is the citation the flip carries, so a ruled
 * issue reaches `ready-for:agent` with a ruling anyone can point at. An epic's agent audience is
 * `check-epic-plan`'s flip alone, written when its plan floor comes back clean, so on an epic this
 * verb writes the marker and leaves both audience labels exactly as it found them.
 *
 * @ruling https://github.com/kamp-us/phoenix/issues/7753#issuecomment-5554842306
 *
 * The gap this closes: triage routes a decision to `ready-for:human` because its deliverable is a
 * judgement, and once the founder has made that judgement in a comment there is no path back. The
 * label still says "a human must decide" about a question a human decided, so every ruled decision
 * costs a driver bypass around the park.
 *
 * **The digest is derived here and taken from nowhere.** There is no `--digest` flag, and adding one
 * would be the defect: a ruling whose scope its caller supplies attests whatever the caller pleased,
 * which is precisely the binding the marker exists to be. The verb reads the issue and takes
 * `./digest.ts`'s answer over the body it actually read.
 *
 * **The order of the two writes is the invariant.** The marker is posted and read back *first*, and
 * only a proven marker earns the audience flip. Reversed, a failed marker write would leave an issue
 * reading `ready-for:agent` with no recorded ruling behind it — a decision that looks pickable
 * because of an authority nobody can point at, which is the exact failure this verb exists to close.
 *
 * A roster that could not be read is `11` — never "not authorized" and never "authorized". That is
 * the collapse `ship cp-approval` already refuses to make, and it is worth more here: this
 * verb's whole output is an authority claim.
 *
 * **The guard sits on the flip, never on the ruling.** A ruled decision whose body carries no
 * acceptance-criteria block still earns its marker — the founder's judgement is the durable thing —
 * but not the audience, because `ready-for:agent` promises a builder can grade the issue cold and a
 * criteria-less one only parks the lane at `build claim` exit 32.
 *
 * **Two shapes name the ruling, and exactly one is given.** `--cites` names a comment that is
 * already on the issue; `--authorization` hands over a file quoting the founder's words, which this
 * verb posts verbatim and then cites — `grill rule`'s shape, through the same check in
 * `../authorization.ts`, so a ruling given in conversation costs the founder no comment to type. The
 * two write orders mirror each other: under `--authorization` the quote lands FIRST and the marker
 * second, because an interrupted run that wrote the marker first would leave it pointing at a
 * comment that does not exist, while the reverse leaves a dated quote nothing honours.
 *
 * **What the authorization shape changes about the authority, and what it does not.** The account
 * invoking this verb still has to be on the control-plane roster, and the comment it posts is that
 * account's; nothing is loosened at the ACL. What moves is who types the words: an agent relaying a
 * founder ruling verbatim is recording it, not making it, and no machine can tell a truthful relay
 * from a fabricated one. That is the same limit `grill rule` states, taken knowingly.
 *
