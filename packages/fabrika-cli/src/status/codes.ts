 * The one exit table all seven `status` verbs allocate from, so a code means one thing across this

 * Every shared seat is **imported** from `../exit-codes.ts` rather than restated as a numeral —
 * the discipline `../triage/codes.ts` and `../ui/codes.ts` state in full: an import makes a drift
 * unrepresentable where a copied number makes it merely detectable.

 * Each verb's `--help` names its exits and that contract states their triggers; the constants below
 * name shared meanings.
