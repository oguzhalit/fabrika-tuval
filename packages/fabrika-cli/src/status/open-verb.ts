/**
 * `status open` — the composite front-door readout: seven fields, each with its own state, source
 * and freshness.
 *
 * **This verb has no zero-scope seat and no failed-read seat at all.** It is the command the skill
 * injects before the session reads a token, and `../verb.ts`'s `refuse()` hardcodes empty stdout —
 * so a front door that refused would be silent on exactly the cold start it exists for. Every
 * source it cannot read becomes a *field state*. Its only refusal is a bad `--field`.
 *
 * **It composes by importing the sibling verbs' pure cores, never by spawning a verb and reading
 * its exit code.** A composite that mapped sibling exit codes would be the package's first
 * cross-group code reader, which would turn every legitimate code reuse into a defect. The mapping
 * from a core's outcome to a field state is the table below, stated rather than left to the
 * implementer, because that mapping *is* the group's purpose: keeping proven-empty apart from
 * unread.
 *
 * **No aggregate state, deliberately.** A roll-up over independently-sourced fields would need
 * a rule for "three fine, one unknown", and every such rule either hides the unknown or drowns the
 * three.
