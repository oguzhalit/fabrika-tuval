/**
 * `status wiring` — is the fabrika plugin actually enabled in this repo?
 *
 * Every other verb in this group answers about something the CLI reads. This one answers about the
 * *other half*: the plugin that carries the skills. A repo can have the CLI installed and answering
 * while no fabrika skill can load in a session there, and until this verb existed nothing said so —
 * an adopting repo ran that way for two days before anyone noticed.
 *
 * **The gating fact is `enabledPlugins`, and the marketplace source is the key's own suffix.** A
 * Claude Code `enabledPlugins` key is `plugin@marketplace`, so one entry names both halves the
 * wiring needs; a bare `fabrika` key names no source and never resolves. `extraKnownMarketplaces`
 * is deliberately not read: Claude Code never registers a project-scope `extraKnownMarketplaces`
 * block — verified against a live install — so a repo carrying one is no more wired than a repo
 * without, and treating it as evidence would green a session that loads nothing.
 *
 * **It detects and writes nothing.** Creating the file is `status bootstrap`'s registry work; a
 * probe that repaired what it measured could never report the state it found.
