/**
 * `status bootstrap` — create **one** missing repo surface from this group's own registry, and read
 * it back.
 *
 * The content is the skill's judgement; the write, the collision guard and the read-back are this
 * verb's. That split is why file content arrives on stdin: *"/fabrika shows what's missing, then
 * runs the primitives to build the missing thing"*. A **line** surface is the exception and
 * carries its own text here: a caller supplying it would let two repos spell one block two ways.
 *
 * **What this builds is fixed in {@link BUILDABLE_SURFACES}, never read off what a verb does when
 * the surface is missing.** That behaviour belongs to a *run* that finds it missing — `ui manifest`
 * refuses without a design manifest, and the manifest is buildable here at once — so reading a
 * refusal as "unbuildable" would make the most important onboarding surface unreachable.
 *
 * **`exists` is an exit-`0` answer, not a refusal.** A target already there is a proven fact the
 * caller acts on, and a non-zero exit cannot carry it. Nothing is written and nothing is overwritten
 * — bar the merge arm an adoption surface takes into a present file, which key-merges or appends
 * once, touching only what the surface declares and never bytes it does not own.

report → triage → plan → build → review → ship. Every unit of work is a GitHub issue moving
through those stages; the fabrika skills run them, and the \`fabrika\` CLI's verbs are the ground
truth at every step.

**The default unit of work is a lane, and the operator drives it.** To get an issue built,
reviewed and shipped, spawn ONE **operator** on it (\`operate\` skill) — it runs the builder,
reviewer and shipper shells itself, feeds every outcome back to the lane ledger, and parks to a
human only when a gate genuinely needs one. Do not hand-dispatch the per-stage shells for normal
work, and never route around them with an ad-hoc general-purpose subagent — an off-pipeline run
skips the gates.

| Work intent | Skill | Agent |
|---|---|---|
| Get one issue built → reviewed → shipped | \`operate\` | **operator** |
| Capture an observation / bug / idea | \`report\` | — |
| Classify + prioritize the backlog | \`triage\` | **triager** |
| Decompose a triaged epic into children | \`plan-epic\`, then \`check-epic-plan\` | — |
| Record a decision | \`adr\` | — |
| Record how the code is shaped | \`write-pattern\` | — |

The per-stage shells are surgical — resume a half-dead lane, re-run one gate, repair one PR —
never the normal entry point: \`build\` (**builder**), \`review\` (**reviewer**), \`ship\`
(**shipper**), and \`heal-ci\` for a PR that is green but going nowhere.`;
