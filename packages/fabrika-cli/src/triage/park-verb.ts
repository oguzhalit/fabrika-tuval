/**
 * `triage park` — demote an issue to `status:needs-info` with the questions that would unblock it.
 *
 * A separate verb rather than `apply --status needs-info`, because a parked issue carries no type, no
 * priority, no audience and no home; folding it into `apply` would make four required flags
 * conditionally required, which is the shape that let v1 emit a fully-triaged-looking issue with a
 * facet missing.
 *
 * **The comment is written first, by design.** An issue must never sit on `status:needs-info` with no
 * statement of what would unblock it, so a comment failure leaves nothing labelled at all — which is
 * also why the two exit-`8` messages differ: only the second can leave a partial label state.
 *
 * The demotion itself runs through the reconcile in `./facets.ts`, shared with `triage apply`.
