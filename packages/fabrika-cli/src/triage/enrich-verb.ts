/**
 * `triage enrich` — write a rewrite (or, with `--epic`, a pitch) above the preserved original.
 *
 * This is the group's only body-writing verb, so it is the only one that can destroy a filing. Two
 * decisions carry that weight, and both live in `./enrich.ts`: a prior enrichment is recognised by
 * the **marker the verb itself wrote**, and the marker is also the boundary between the region this
 * verb owns and the bytes it must never touch.
 *
 * **The leak asymmetry is the reason the guard runs over stdin rather than the composed body.**
 * `readAuthored`'s callers usually scan what they composed, so nothing a verb appends can escape the
 * predicate. Here the composed body *contains foreign content by design* — the preserved original —
 * and that content is redacted, not refused, because refusing it would strand the enrichment on
 * somebody else's leak while preserving it unredacted would re-commit that leak to a public issue.
 *
 * **A criteria-less body is a fact, except over `ready-for:agent`.** That label is the promise a
 * builder can pick the issue up cold, and the criteria block is what the promise is made of — so
 * this verb reads the target's live labels and refuses on {@link CRITERIA_REQUIRED} rather than
 * leaving the stamp standing over no contract, the same seat `triage apply` and `decision rule`
 * refuse the audience on.
 *
 * **This is where the outside-diff evidence marker is written.** A criterion the diff's bytes cannot
 * settle either way carries a trailing `[evidence: <source>]`, and the choice belongs at mint time:
 * the author knows the proof is a hand-verification or a pre-fix artifact, and the grader reading it
 * back months later cannot infer that from the sentence. The grammar is the wire format's, so a
 * drifted keyword or a marker naming no source refuses on {@link MALFORMED_CRITERIA} beside every
 * other block defect, and the marked rows are counted on stderr so the write is visible to whoever
 * ran it.
 *
