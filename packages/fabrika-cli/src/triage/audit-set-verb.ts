/**
 * `triage audit-set` — the whole open issue set a read-only backlog audit judges, for one label.
 *
 * `triage queue`'s read with two differences an audit needs: the label has no default, so the set a
 * sweep judges is always named by its caller, and nothing is truncated, because a merge checks its
 * rows against this set and a capped set would pass a merge over a subset. It reads and never writes.
