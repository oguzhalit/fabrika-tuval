 * @ruling https://github.com/kamp-us/phoenix/issues/7393#issuecomment-5519748588
 *
 * The decision is the guard's. {@link judge} and {@link resolve} from `../guard/homing.ts` are
 * called here, never restated and never parsed out of the guard's report, so the guard and the sweep
 * cannot disagree about what a breach is. This module adds only the split between the two breach
 * kinds. A double-marked issue has one mechanical remedy: a standing lane is milestone-less by
 * design, so the milestone goes and the lane stays. An un-homed issue has three (home it, lane it,
 * kill it), and choosing one is triage's judgment, so the sweep lists it and changes nothing.
 *
 * IO-free and total; the board reads and writes live in `./sweep-homes-verb.ts`.
