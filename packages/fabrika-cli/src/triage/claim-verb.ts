/**
 * `triage claim` — take one lane's claim on one issue, proven by read-back.
 *
 * Post this lane's marker and resolve the race through `claim.ts`.
 * See `triage claim --help` for the answer contract.
 *
 * **A claim names a lane, and the lane is the token this verb hands back.** A run with no `--token`
 * mints one and races under its nonce; a run that passes the token it was handed re-enters the lane
 * it already owns. That is what makes re-entry idempotent *and* keeps two triagers of one session
 * apart — the session id alone told each sibling of a fan-out that it held its sibling's marker, and
 * both wrote the issue.
 *
 * Everything a marker set could fail to say is a refusal instead. An unreadable comment list, a
 * shape that is not a list of comments, a marker whose ordering key will not parse — none of them
 * resolve to "no competing claim", which is the fail-open shape this verb exists to design out (see
 * `claim.ts`). A comment list that the issue's own declared count proves short is one of those
 * refusals too, which is why both reads here go through `listCommentsReconciled` rather than
 * `listComments`: the rule is only as good as the set it is handed, and a stale set once answered
 * `won` for a lane that had already lost. The resolution itself is pure and lives in
 * `claim.ts`; this module is the IO and the exit codes.
 *
 * The `Attempt`/`Existence` results the IO returns are **values, not the `E` channel**: a 404 and a
 * 502 are outcomes this verb maps onto its own codes, not exceptions (Effect-TS/effect `LLMS.md`
 * §"Error handling" — the typed error channel is for faults a caller recovers from, and `io/exec.ts`
 * already folds the spawn fault in).
