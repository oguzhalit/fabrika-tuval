/**
 * `triage scratch` — the per-lane scratch path a triager writes its working files under.
 *
 * `<temp root>/fabrika-triage/<session-id>/<issue>-<claim-nonce>/<slug>`. A fan-out of triagers runs
 * under one session id, so a namespace keyed on the session alone hands every lane the same
 * directory and a fixed name like `authored.md` clobbers a sibling's file silently — which happened
 * on 2026-08-20 across three lanes, and was caught only because the overwritten content happened to
 * be a different issue's body. The claim nonce in the key makes that unconstructible rather than
 * detectable, exactly as `build scratch` does for build lanes.
 *
 * The printed path is machine-local and must never reach a posted artifact — the leak predicate the
 * writing verbs share reds on the temp roots it lives under.
