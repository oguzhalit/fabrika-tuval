/**
 * The audience facet's two labels, and the writes that move an issue from one to the other.
 *
 * Who picks an issue up is a two-valued facet, and three seams act on it: `triage apply`
 * stamps it, `plan flip` moves a gated epic onto the agent side, and `decision rule` moves a ruled
 * issue of any type but an epic there. The label strings are derived from `../config/board.ts`'s vocabulary rather than
 * typed, so a board that renames an audience renames it everywhere at once.
 *
 * **The predicates are here because the ordering they encode is a safety property.** The add lands
 * before the remove, so a half-applied flip leaves the issue carrying *both* labels rather than
 * neither — and {@link audienceSettled} then reads that as unsettled, because a caller that treated
 * "the agent label is on it" as success would report a flip that also left the human label standing.
