/**
 * The `triage enrich` envelope: how a body is composed, and how a prior enrichment is recognised.
 *
 * **Detection is a marker the verb writes, not a shape it infers**, ruled on 2026-08-08. The two
 * shape-based detectors that preceded it were mode-scoped and keyed
 * on disjoint literals, so a re-run in the *other* mode matched neither, fell through to "first
 * enrichment ⇒ wrap", and nested the whole existing envelope — provenance boundary included — inside
 * a fresh block, compounding per run. A marker is one rule and is mode-independent, so that class
 * dies for every marker-bearing body rather than for one axis of it.
 *
 * **The marker is also the boundary.** It sits on its own line immediately above the preserved
 * `<details>` block, so "is this enriched?" and "where does the authored region end?" are the same
 * read. Nothing has to locate a `<details>` opener or a summary literal, which is what made the old
 * detectors mode-scoped in the first place.
 *
 * **The issue number is bound into the marker**, so an enriched body pasted into a *different* issue
 * reads as fresh and is wrapped rather than partially overwritten. That covers both the
 * quote-impersonation case the retired terminality test defended against and the
 * paste-that-ends-the-body residual it could not — the case `contract.md` named as the limit of any
 * content-derived test.
 *
 * Pre-marker bodies are recognised by `./enrich-legacy.ts`, which is one-time migration code.
