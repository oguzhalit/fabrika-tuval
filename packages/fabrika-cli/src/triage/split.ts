 * called that back-reference load-bearing and then never checked the body carried it, so a child
 * filed without it was permanently invisible to the guard and every re-run fired a fresh twin.
 *
 * **Both halves, never one.** A candidate matches on `(back-reference AND normalized title)`. The
 * back-reference alone collapses every sibling of one parent into the first child ever split from it;
 * the title alone collapses same-titled children of unrelated parents. Each half alone is a silent
 * lost split, which is the direction this verb is least allowed to fail in.
