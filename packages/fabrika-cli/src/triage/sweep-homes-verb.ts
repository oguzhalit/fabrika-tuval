/**
 * `triage sweep-homes` — the apply side of `guard homing-guard check`: clear the milestone on every
 * double-marked triaged issue, keep its standing lane, and leave one trail comment on it.
 *
 * @ruling https://github.com/kamp-us/phoenix/issues/7393#issuecomment-5519748588
 *
 * The scan is the guard's own: the same paged `status:triaged` read and the same record mapping, so
 * the plan in `./sweep-homes.ts` is judged over the set the guard judges.
 *
 * **A dry run is the default.** Writes happen only under `--apply`, and only there is the trail
 * citation read from stdin.
 *
 * **Per issue, the trail lands before the clear.** The issue is re-read first and skipped as `moved`
 * when the breach it was planned from is gone. Its comments are read reconciled against the count the
 * issue declares, so a trail this verb posted moments earlier cannot be missed by a short list, and
 * the trail is posted unless one carrying this milestone's marker is already there. Then the milestone is cleared and read back.
 * That order lets a run that died between the two writes be re-run: the breach is still on the
 * board, and the trail is found rather than posted twice.
