/**
 * `triage kill` — close an agent-filed issue not-planned, auditably.
 *
 * This is the group's only irreversible act on a public board, which shapes every decision below:
 * no precondition resolves to a plausible value, and no write runs before all of them are proven.
 *
 * **Two guards, and they are different guards.** A filing with no agent signal — no footer *and*
 * no operator author — is human-owned and the verb refuses outright, *unless* `--duplicate-of` names
 * a survivor: a fold moves the content rather than discarding it, so it is licensed whatever the
 * provenance. An agent signal makes a filing *eligible*, not closeable — a human-invoked `/report`
 * emits the same footer, so `--confirm` is the confirmation step made structural. That is why
 * `--confirm` is optional at the parser and refused at the verb: a parser-required flag's absence is
 * a usage error, indistinguishable from a typo, while the confirmation is a decision whose absence
 * must be a proven refusal a caller can read as one.
 *
 * **Write order is the auditability guarantee.** Fold the duplicate content, post the reason, write
 * the labels — every triage status stripped through `./facets.ts`'s reconcile, `closed-by-triage`
 * applied — then close, and each step gates the next, so a failure before the close leaves the issue
 * OPEN, which is the recoverable direction. The three unguarded sequential writes this replaces
 * landed a closed, unexplained, unlabelled issue whenever the middle one failed.
