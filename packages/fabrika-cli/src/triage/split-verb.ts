/**
 * `triage split` — create one child of a bundled report, **once**, and cross-link the parent.
 *
 * One transaction: the label precondition, the two reads that decide `created` vs `reused`, the
 * create, its read-back, and the parent comment. Splitting them would hand a caller the chance to
 * skip one, and the one most worth skipping is the read that prevents a twin.
 *
 * **Where the guarantee lives.** Read 1 — the `status:needs-triage` queue — is the create-once read:
 * it is the read-after-write-consistent source, and every child this verb makes carries that label by
 * construction, so the read can see its own output. Read 2 — the parent's timeline — is
 * supplementary: it reaches children already triaged out of the queue, and it lags by an observed
 * 30–60 minutes, which is why it widens the net and carries nothing.
 *
 * **A read that cannot see is never an answer.** Every unreadable precondition — the parent, the
 * label set, the queue, the timeline, or any candidate's body — exits `11`. Falling through an
 * `Unknown` to "no match, therefore create" is exactly how one split becomes two issues on a public
 * board, and it is the defect the predecessor shipped: its guard printed a number or nothing, so an
 * auth failure read as a proven "safe to create".
