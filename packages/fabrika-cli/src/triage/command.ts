/**
 * The `triage` verb group — `fabrika triage <verb>`.
 *
 * The adapter and nothing else: it declares the flags (`--help` is the interface, so every flag
 * carries a one-line description), runs the pure verb, and emits its outcome. Every decision lives
 * in the `*-verb.ts` modules beside it, which is what makes each refusal testable without spawning a
 * process.
 *
 * This is the group's foundation slice: the shared exit table (`codes.ts`), the scanned-count
 * convention (`scope.ts`) and the GitHub reads and writes in `../io/issues.ts` land here, ahead of
 * the verbs that consume them. Later slices append their leaves below and add one line each to the
 * `withSubcommands` list at the end of the file, which is why that list is one entry per line.
 *
 * **Every leaf is declared with `leafCommand`, never a bare `Command.make`** — the bare form
 * silently opts out of the excess-operand guard, which `../excess-operand.unit.test.ts` reds on.
