/**
 * `triage homes` — the assignable homes: every **open** milestone joined to its roadmap arc or
 * campaign row, plus the standing lanes this repo declares AND carries the labels for.
 *
 * **Zero open milestones is a refusal, not an answer.** An empty candidate list routes the caller
 * toward a standing lane or a close, and a close driven by a failed read is irreversible — so both
 * "I read nothing" cases red on {@link ZERO_SCOPE} and both "I could not look" cases on
 * {@link PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN}, never on `1`, which would fuse an unreachable GitHub with a
 * mistyped flag.
 *
 * An **absent** roadmap is neither: it is a proven negative, so the milestones list unjoined — the
 * same degrade disposition the rest of the corpus declares for that file. Only a roadmap that exists
 * and could not be read is UNKNOWN.
 *
 * Curating the milestone set is a human roadmap act, so this verb creates none. It
 * offers only open, roadmap-joined milestones, which designs out the mismatch where a closed
 * milestone reports as a valid home.
 *
 * A row can carry a **running** marker: an `active` campaign is closed to new intake unless the work
 * is p0 or p1, or blocks one of that milestone's own in-flight lanes. Which milestones those are,
 * is data — `ROADMAP.md`'s `## Campaigns` table, read through the campaign parser off the roadmap
 * text this verb already has open. A marked row is still
 * offered: the two exceptions are real, and a removed row cannot carry them.
