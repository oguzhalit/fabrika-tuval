/**
 * Recognise a **pre-marker** enrichment envelope, so a body written before the marker existed is
 * migrated rather than double-wrapped.
 *
 * **This module is one-time migration code and is meant to be deleted.** The migration is
 * self-healing: a legacy body is recognised once, its preserved block is kept,
 * and the marker is stamped in passing — so every body this module can match converts on its next
 * enrichment and never returns here. The branch retires with v1-backlog absorption, and retiring it
 * is a delete of this file plus the `legacyPreserved` argument at `detect`'s two call sites. Nothing
 * else imports it, and no other module encodes a v1 envelope shape.
 *
 * The two shapes below are the two detectors `contract.md` specified before the ruling, kept here
 * *only* as recognisers. They are never used to decide a body written after the marker landed: a
 * marker binding another issue short-circuits ahead of them (`./enrich.ts`), which is what keeps a
 * pasted envelope from impersonating an enrichment through the legacy door.
