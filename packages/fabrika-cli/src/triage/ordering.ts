/**
 * Does a body **state** an ordering — "do not start until #N" — and which issues does it name?
 *
 * The native `blocked_by` graph is the one carrier of "do not start this yet", so `triage enrich`
 * is fail-closed against a body that states an ordering the graph carries no edge for. This module
 * is the reading half of that: the writing half is `--blocked-by` in `./blocked-by.ts`.
 *
 * **The phrase must bind the reference; co-presence is not a statement.** A line carrying an
 * ordering word *somewhere* and a `#N` *somewhere* matches an issue that merely writes ABOUT
 * orderings — a body saying "Searched the queue and open issues for ordering/edge/blocked work.
 * #<a>, #<b> and #<c> are all live gate defects" names no prerequisite at all. That red could not
 * be cleared by wiring an edge, so it would leave the caller with only the reword escape for a body
 * that is already correct.
 *
 * **Quotations are mentions.** An inline-code span or a double-quoted span is somebody else's
 * words being reported, which is why the scan reads a line with those spans blanked — a body that
 * quotes another issue's `"**Blocked. Do not start until #<n> has merged**"` states no ordering of
 * its own.
 *
 * **A third-person subject is somebody else's prerequisite.** A body states its own ordering as
 * "Blocked on #N"; "it is already blocked on #N" is a report about another issue, and no edge on
 * *this* issue could ever clear it. A body reading "Not folded into #<n>: its criteria are scoped
 * to … and it is already blocked on #<m>" owns no prerequisite at all.
 *
 * Both narrowings trade a missed red for a red nobody can clear, and that trade is the right one
 * here because the refusal has **no override**: a false negative leaves an issue the old, pre-gate
 * world already tolerated, while a false red strands a correct body on the reword escape.
