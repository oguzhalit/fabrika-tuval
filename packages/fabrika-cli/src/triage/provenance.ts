/**
 * The filing-provenance predicate: was this issue reported by an agent, or typed by a human?
 *
 * **Two agent signals, not one.** The report footer is the signal because every filing showed the
 * same shared account, so authorship carried no information. A later ruling, on 2026-08-09, narrows
 * that: a filing authored by an account in the **configured operator set** is agent-reported
 * whether or not the footer is present, because footer-absence there is a gap in the emitter rather
 * than evidence of a human author. Footer-absence from any *other* author is still human-owned.
 *
 * **This file is the group's single definition of that predicate.** `triage kill` re-runs the test
 * itself rather than trusting a caller to have run `triage provenance` first, which makes the guard
 * structural instead of a caller's discipline; the `triage provenance` verb imports it too. Neither
 * may re-derive the footer match or the operator-membership test.

/**
 * Whether a body carries the agent footer, matched **anchored at line-begin**.
 *
 * `renderFooter` (`../report/compose.ts`) emits `` `---\n<sub>` `` then the present fields joined
 * with ` · `, and the literal `Filed by an agent` is always the first of them — so the emitted line
 * begins with `<sub>Filed by an agent` whatever else the footer carries. Three of the five fields
 * are droppable and take their separator with them, so the match may require none of them.
 *
 * **The anchor deliberately diverges from `../report/file-verb.ts`'s bare
 * `body.includes("Filed by an agent")` — do not "fix" the two back into agreement.** That check is
 * correct there: it is a read-back over a body the same process just composed, so nothing else can
 * be in it. Here the body is foreign, and a bare substring fails **open toward `agent`** — an issue
 * that merely quotes the phrase (a bug report about the footer, a pasted body, a discussion of
 * the footer's own decision record) would answer `agent`, which is the close-eligible direction.
 * Anchoring makes the failure
 * land on `human`, the protected one.
 *
 * An empty body has no footer, so it answers `false`. An *unreadable* body never reaches here: that
 * is a precondition failure the caller seats on `11`, because a verdict manufactured from a failed
 * read is not a measurement.
