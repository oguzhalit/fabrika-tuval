/**
 * The `triage claim` race protocol, as a pure function of the comments that were read.
 *
 * The whole verb is one rule: **`won` requires positive proof that the earliest surviving marker is
 * this lane's.** Nothing else may produce it — not an empty comment list, not a marker whose
 * ordering key is unreadable, not a set the caller could not fetch. v1's claim printed `won` and
 * exited 0 when its own identity read came back empty, because every comparison against an empty
 * string succeeded; that is a fail-open claim on a token that cannot write. Here the absence of
 * evidence resolves to {@link Unresolvable} or to `lost`, never to `won`.
 *
 * **A session is not a lane.** One triage fan-out routinely runs several triagers under one
 * `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, so a marker stamped with the session alone cannot tell two of them
 * apart: on 2026-08-18 two siblings each read a same-session marker back as their own and both
 * resolved `won`, then both wrote the issue. Every claimant therefore names itself as a
 * {@link Caller} — the same identity the `build` namespace resolves ownership against — and a
 * same-session marker under a different lane nonce is somebody else's.
 *
 * Keeping the resolution here rather than in the verb is what makes the losing and the ambiguous
 * branches testable without a network: the verb supplies markers, a clock and a caller, and
 * this module decides.
