/**
 * The mechanical acceptance-criteria shape repair — the pure core of `triage repair-criteria`.
 *
 * `wire/acceptance-criteria.ts` pins the block's shape: the one conforming heading
 * (`### Acceptance criteria`, level and spelling both part of it) over checkbox items. The board
 * carries hundreds of already-filed bodies that miss it — every one answers `Malformed`, and the
 * review gate may neither hand-parse the block nor invent criteria, so the PR stalls with no verdict
 * at all — and the producer-side fix stops only *new* drift. This module plans the repairs that
 * are pure shape, so safe to automate:
 *
 * 1. a heading whose text is already exactly the conforming text and whose only defect is the
 *    level, rewritten to `###`;
 * 2. items written as an ordinary list under a block that carries no checkbox at all — plain
 *    bullets (`- `) or ordered items (`1. `), one family per block — each rewritten to an unchecked
 *    checkbox with its text byte-for-byte unchanged.
 *
 * Anything else is refused, never guessed — repairing drifted *text* is indistinguishable from
 * inventing a contract, and so is deciding that a prose paragraph beside the list was meant as a
 * criterion. The item conversion is bounded the same way from the other side: a block that already
 * carries one checkbox is left alone, because promoting the remaining items there would *add*
 * criteria to a contract that already says something, and a block mixing the two list families is
 * left alone because which one states the criteria is the author's answer, not this module's.
 *
 * The plan acts on the **authored region only**. The `<!-- fabrika:enriched … -->` marker (or the
 * legacy v1 envelope) is the boundary `triage enrich`'s own guards rely on, and a `##` heading down
 * inside the preserved original is a historical record — rewriting it would falsify the verbatim
 * block. Classification reads the **whole body**, because that is what the reader grades; the
 * reader skips a `<details>` appendix, so a body whose only drift is buried there is
 * `Absent` — nothing to repair, and nothing left un-gateable either.

 * can still meet inside the window without either being the section's own.
 *
 * A checkbox item **anywhere** in the section refuses regardless of the window: the block already
 * states criteria, and promoting the items beside them would add to what it says rather than fix
 * how it says it.
 *
 * A **nested** sub-item is converted like any other and becomes its own criterion. That is the
