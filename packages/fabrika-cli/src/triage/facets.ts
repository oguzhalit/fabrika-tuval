/**
 * The owned-facet reconcile that `triage apply` and `triage park` both write through, and the closed

 *
 * A facet owns a pattern of labels and names the ones it keeps. **Every label the pattern matches and
 * the keep set does not is removed; every label no facet's pattern matches is preserved untouched.**
 * The milestone obeys the same rule — it is not a label, so it plans as its own change, but it is a
 * facet, which is what stops `--lane` from landing an issue on both a standing lane and a
 * milestone — a state the board does not have — while a labels-only read-back certifies it.
 *
 * **One engine, two verbs, deliberately.** The failure this engine exists to design out was a
 * *delete*, not a write: the priority facet owned `/^p\d+$/`, the applied `p2` was not in the keep
 * set, and a well-formed run
 * stripped the issue's only priority while printing a success line indistinguishable from a correct
 * one. Two independently-written reconciles are two chances to re-derive that, so the reconcile, the
 * change plan and the read-back assertion live here once and the verbs differ only in the facet table
 * they pass in.
