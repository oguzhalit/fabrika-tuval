/**
 * `triage provenance` — was this issue reported by an agent or typed by a human?
 *
 * The predicate itself lives in `./provenance.ts` — including the operator-account signal the
 * Exported because `triage kill` re-checks it rather than trusting a caller
 * to have run this verb.
 *
 * **A present-but-empty body answers `human`; an unreadable one refuses.** Those are different
 * facts and this verb keeps them apart. An empty body is a measurement — the body is there, it
 * carries no footer, and the protective reading of "no footer" is `human`, because the only
 * irreversible act downstream is a kill. An unreadable body is not a measurement at all, and
 * answering `human` over it would be a verdict manufactured from a failed read. The empty-body
 * default is reached only once the author has been tested: an operator-authored filing is
 * agent-reported by the ruling however little it says.
