/**
 * `triage repair-criteria` — repair an acceptance-criteria block's shape, one issue or the board.
 *
 * The counterpart to `review criteria`'s refusal: when the wire read answers `Malformed`, the
 * review gate may neither hand-parse the block nor invent criteria, so a drifted body stalls its PR
 * with no verdict at all. This verb is the one legal recovery, and it repairs exactly what
 * `./repair-criteria.ts` proves mechanical — everything else exits on the group's `14`.
 *
 * The sweep exists because the drift is a standing corpus, not one issue — 279 bodies when it was
 * measured: the
 * same plan runs per open issue, each repair is written and read back individually, and every issue
 * gets an outcome line — a sweep that only named what it changed would make "never looked" and
 * "looked and conforming" one claim.
