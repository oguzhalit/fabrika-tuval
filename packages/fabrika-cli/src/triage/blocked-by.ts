/**
 * `triage apply --blocked-by` — turn a stated ordering into native `blocked_by` edges.
 *
 * The native `blocked_by` graph is the one carrier of "do not start this yet", and until this flag
 * no triage verb could reach it: `map ticket` was the only caller of `addBlockedBy`, and only for a
 * wayfinding map's own tickets, so a triager filing an ordered slice set wrote the ordering as
 * prose, which no builder reads.
 *
 * Three shapes carry the weight. **Every target is resolved before any edge is written**, so a typo'd
 * number refuses over a graph nobody touched rather than half-way through one. **The edges already
 * live are read first and skipped**, which is what makes the flag idempotent for a resumed lane
 * without resting on an unverified claim about how the API answers a duplicate POST. And **a target
 * that is a pull request is refused on its own seat**, because `repos/{o}/{r}/issues/<n>` serves PRs
 * — so one resolves `Present` and the proven-absent arm never fires for it (see `edgeTarget`).
