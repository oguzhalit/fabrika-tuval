/**
 * The guard over **authored** text — the bytes the caller just wrote — shared by `triage split`,
 * `triage enrich`, `triage park` and `triage kill`.
 *
 * All four take their text on stdin only and refuse the same three ways: an unread pipe is UNKNOWN,
 * a read-but-empty one is `3`, a body that IS a path is `6`, and a machine-local path in it is `5`.
 * Only the nouns differ, so the nouns are the parameter and the decisions are here — a second copy
 * per verb is four chances for the refusals to drift apart.
 *
 * **The asymmetry this module encodes:** authored text is *refusable* because its author can fix it.
 * Foreign content a verb copies forward is redacted instead, because refusing it would strand the
 * operation on somebody else's mistake. Redaction is therefore deliberately absent here.
 *
 * The predicate itself is imported from `../report/leaks.ts` rather than re-derived: a second leak
 * predicate that drifts from the first is worse than either alone.
