/**
 * `triage apply` — the whole triaged transition as one owned-facet reconcile, read back positively.
 *
 * Type, priority, audience, status and the home land together or not at all, and what the verb
 * reports is what it re-read, never what it requested. v1's read-back did `landed ?? requested`, so a
 * read that found no status label reported the *asked-for* one as landed; a read-back that falls back
 * to the request is not a read-back.
 *
 * The reconcile itself — which labels are owned, what is removed, what is preserved, and the shape
 * the read-back asserts — lives in `./facets.ts` and is shared with `triage park`.
 *
 * Only check-epic-plan stamps an epic ready for an agent. Reporting the requested audience
 * instead of the reconciled stamp would recreate the read-back fallback this verb forbids.
 *
 * `--blocked-by` reads, writes and read-back live in `./blocked-by.ts`.
 * **Its output column reports this run, not the graph**: the dependency
 * endpoint is read only when the flag is present, so a flagless run prints it empty whatever the
 * issue waits on — reading it as "no prerequisites" is the false safety `20` exists to close.
 *
 * `--class` supplies the seed read by `../lane/class-seed.ts`. Unlike the other facets,
 * its vocabulary is closed in code rather than declared on the board.
