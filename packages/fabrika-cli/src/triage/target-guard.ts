/**
 * The two preconditions every mutating `triage` verb re-reads on its target: it is still open, and
 * no live claim marker on it names a claimant other than the asking lane.
 *
 * `triage claim` resolved the race correctly and nothing after it read the answer back, so the
 * protocol held only as long as prose discipline did. On 2026-08-15 it did not: a session that had
 * read `lost` ran `triage enrich` anyway and replaced the winner's authored body four minutes after
 * that session had closed the issue. Both facts were sitting on the issue and
 * neither was read.
 *
 * **Holding no marker passes.** The check is "does a live marker name somebody else", not "do I hold
 * one": an unclaimed issue is the ordinary first-triage case, and demanding a marker would refuse
 * every existing caller. The consequence is that this guard narrows the window rather than closing
 * it — two unclaimed sessions still race — which is `triage claim`'s job, not this one's.
 *
 * **Foreignness is the session+lane pair, never the session alone.** A `--token` names which lane
 * of the session is asking, and a same-session marker under a different nonce is somebody else's —
 * the identity `triage claim` already resolves on and the `build` namespace resolves ownership
 * against, now read on this side of the claim too.
 *
 * **The marker read is reconciled, not merely made.** A comment list short of the count the issue
 * declares hides a live competitor, and hiding one here reads as "nobody else holds it" — the same
 * stale read that once made `triage claim` answer `won` for a losing lane. Both sides of the
 * claim therefore go through `listCommentsReconciled`, so a read that cannot be proven whole refuses
 * on `11` instead of passing this gate.

 * matches no marker, so a set full of live competitors would resolve to "nobody else holds it".
 *
 * A tokenless caller (`AnySession`) cannot prove *which* lane of its session it is, so it is priced
 * fail-closed on exactly that ambiguity: it passes its session's markers while they all name one
 * lane, and once two lanes of its session hold live markers every one of them is foreign, because
 * the caller has no way to say which is its own. That keeps the uncontested call sites working and
