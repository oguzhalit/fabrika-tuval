/**
 * Issue a reconcile plan's changes in order, counting how many landed before one failed.
 *
 * The count is the point. Exit `8` reports "write failed after `<k>` of `<m>` changes", and a caller
 * told only that *something* failed cannot tell an issue that was never touched from one left half
 * labelled — so the changes are decomposed into individually-observable add/remove calls rather than
 * collapsed into a single replace-set `PUT`, and the applier reports the index it stopped at.
 *
 * The adds go through `POST .../labels`, which **creates an unknown label rather than rejecting it**
 * — so the caller's vocabulary precondition is not optional politeness, it is the only thing between
 * a typo and a repo-wide grey label.
