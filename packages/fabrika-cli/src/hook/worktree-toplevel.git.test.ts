/**
 * Where `hook worktree-create` lays a tree for each place a session can be launched in one clone,
 * driven through the verb against real git.
 *
 * The committed golden payload carries a repository root in its `cwd`, so it passes whether the verb
 * trusts `cwd`, resolves its toplevel, or resolves the primary tree. The subdirectory and the
 * linked-tree cases are the discriminating ones: trusting `cwd` fails the first, and trusting
 * `--show-toplevel` fails the second.
