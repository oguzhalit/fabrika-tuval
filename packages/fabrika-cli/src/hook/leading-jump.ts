/**
 * The leading directory jump — reading one off a command string, and deciding whether it escapes the
 * working tree the command was issued in.
 *
 * IO-free on purpose: the caller does the git probes and hands this module three absolute paths, so
 * every refusal below is a unit test rather than a worktree fixture.
 *
 * **Why this decision exists at all.** Claude Code's own isolation guard reads the *command text*:
 * `git -C <other-checkout>`, `--git-dir=`, `GIT_DIR=` and `cd <other-checkout> && git …` are each
 * refused by name. A program that reaches git in a child process carries no matchable `git` token,
 * so `cd <shared> && node …/bin.ts build branch <n>` runs, exits 0, and leaves the shared checkout
 * standing on the lane branch — observed twice in the field. The jump is the one half of that shape
 * that is statically decidable from the command string alone, which is why the refusal is keyed on
 * it and not on what follows.
 *
 * The keyword set is `cd` and `pushd` because the ruling names the act — a leading directory jump —
 * rather than one spelling of it. It is not a shell parser and must not become one: anything it
 * cannot resolve to a literal path is refused rather than guessed at, which is the same polarity the
 * harness takes when it answers *too complex to verify that it stays inside the worktree*.
 *
 * The wrappers it looks through are only the ones whose stripping is decidable from the text alone
 * — a subshell, a command substitution, a brace group, `VAR=value` prefixes. The spellings it still
 * does not see are listed in the decision record under *What stays out of key*, and that list is
 * the guard's bound rather than an oversight.
