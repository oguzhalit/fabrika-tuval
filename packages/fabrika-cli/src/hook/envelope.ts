/**
 * The harness hook envelope — the JSON object Claude Code writes to a hook's stdin.
 *
 * Every fabrika hook meets the harness here and nowhere else, so this is the one module that says
 * what an envelope *is*. The four fields it requires are not a guess and not a doc summary: they are
 * the keys present in **both** captured envelopes committed beside this file
 * (`__fixtures__/PROVENANCE.md`) — captured bytes, which are this contract's only ground truth.
 * Everything else the harness sends is per-event and stays untyped here — a hook that needs
 * `tool_input` reads it off {@link Envelope.fields}, and the golden test is where the per-event key
 * sets are pinned.
 *
 * The read is **total and three-way**: an envelope, a proven non-envelope, or an unread fd 0. Those
 * are three different claims and none of them may collapse into another — the shape the
 * predecessor's fd-0 reader already learned the hard way (`../io/stdin.ts`).
