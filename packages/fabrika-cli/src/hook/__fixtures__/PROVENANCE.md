# Capture provenance — the golden hook envelopes beside this file

A captured payload is the only ground truth for anything the runtime emits, and this file is what
lets a reviewer tell a captured payload from a hand-authored one **without the authoring session**.
Read it before trusting any fixture here; a fixture with no provenance beside it is an assertion,
not evidence.

| Fixture | Harness event | Matcher | Capture |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`session-start.payload.golden.json`](session-start.payload.golden.json) | `SessionStart` (`source: startup`) | — | [1](#capture-1--the-surface-envelopes) |
| [`pre-tool-use.payload.golden.json`](pre-tool-use.payload.golden.json) | `PreToolUse` | `Bash` | [1](#capture-1--the-surface-envelopes) |
| [`pre-tool-use-spawn.payload.golden.json`](pre-tool-use-spawn.payload.golden.json) | `PreToolUse` (a subagent spawn, `model: "opus"`) | `Task` | [2](#capture-2--the-spawn-envelopes) |
| [`pre-tool-use-spawn-unset-model.payload.golden.json`](pre-tool-use-spawn-unset-model.payload.golden.json) | `PreToolUse` (a subagent spawn, no model passed) | `Task` | [2](#capture-2--the-spawn-envelopes) |

**Sanitization — one substitution, and only one, in every fixture here.** The operator's
home-directory segment inside `transcript_path` is replaced with `<operator>`; nothing else is
touched. That is the same, and the only, edit the repo's prior captured fixture carried — v1's
`worktree-sweep` payload, deleted with that package (#6100) — and it is required rather than
cosmetic: no committed artifact in this repo carries a home,
machine-local or absolute operator path. The opaque per-session values (`session_id`, `prompt_id`,
`tool_use_id`) are the **real** captured ones and were deliberately left alone — they identify a
throwaway capture session in a temp directory and name no person or machine.

## Capture 1 — the surface envelopes

**Captured:** 2026-08-09, against **Claude Code 2.1.226**.

**How:** one nested `claude -p` run against the live harness, with a throwaway `--settings` file whose
`hooks` block registered `{"type": "command", "command": "cat > <sink>"}` on `SessionStart` and on
`PreToolUse` (matcher `Bash`). The probe tool call was `echo capture-probe`. The bytes below each
fixture's first line are the raw stdin the harness wrote to that sink, byte for byte.

**Where the record lives:** the raw bytes were posted to the authoring repository's issue tracker
(comment `5233372828`) before either fixture was written.

## Capture 2 — the spawn envelopes

**Captured:** 2026-08-09, against **Claude Code 2.1.226**.

**How:** two nested `claude -p` runs in a throwaway temp directory, each with its own `--settings`
file whose `hooks` block registered `{"type": "command", "command": "cat > <sink>; exit 2"}` on
`PreToolUse` with matcher `Task`. The `exit 2` blocks the spawn, so the envelope is captured without
the subagent ever running. Run 1's prompt asked for the `model` parameter `"opus"`; run 2's asked for
no model at all — the two branches the spawn decision has to tell apart.

**Where the record lives:** the raw bytes were posted to the authoring repository's issue tracker
(comment `5233974204`) before either fixture was written.

**Two things this capture settles that a hand-authored envelope gets wrong.** A spawn's `tool_name`
is **`Agent`**, not `Task` — the matcher is `Task` and it fired, but the envelope says `Agent`, so a
guard filtering on `tool_name === "Task"` would never run. And the model arrives as the harness alias
**`opus`**, never the canonical `claude-opus-4-8`. The alias map that used this evidence is retired;
the captured envelopes remain a record of what the harness sent.

<a id="capture-3--the-worktreecreate-envelope"></a>
## Capture 3 — the `WorktreeCreate` envelope

**Captured:** 2026-08-28, against **Claude Code 2.1.251**.

**How:** a throwaway git repository at `/private/tmp/fabrika-worktree-capture/repo` (one commit, no
remote), and `claude -p "say ok" --worktree capture-probe` against a `--settings` file whose `hooks`
block registered `{"type": "command", "command": "cat > <sink>", "timeout": 30}` on `WorktreeCreate`.
The probe writes stdin and prints no path, so the harness refused the creation with
`WorktreeCreate hook failed: hook succeeded but returned no worktree path` — the envelope is captured
and no worktree is made, which is the same shape capture 2 used for the blocked spawns.

**Why a temp directory outside the session scratchpad:** this repo commits no operator or
machine-local path, and the payload's `cwd` is *the repo the probe ran in*, verbatim. Capturing under
a path that carried an operator segment would have forced a second edit to a captured value. Only
`transcript_path` carries the home, so the elision below stays the single substitution it is
everywhere else here.

**A second run proved the mechanism the fixture only describes.** With the probe replaced by a script
that ran `git worktree add --detach "$cwd/.claude/worktrees/$name" HEAD` and echoed that path,
`claude --worktree roundtrip` started normally and `git worktree list` showed the tree at
`…/repo/.claude/worktrees/roundtrip`. So the constructed layout in
[`../worktree-create.ts`](../worktree-create.ts) is an observed round trip, not an inference from the
harness's default path.

## What is golden here, and what is not

The golden part is the **key set** — which keys the harness sends and which it does not. `PreToolUse`
carries `prompt_id`, `permission_mode` and `effort`, none of which the hand-authored envelope in v1's
spawn-guard test knew about; `SessionStart` carries `source` and carries **no** `tool_name`,
`tool_input` or `prompt_id`; a spawn's `tool_input` carries `subagent_type` and `run_in_background`
beside the optional `model`; `WorktreeCreate` carries `name`, a slug, and carries **no**
`worktree_path` and **no** `base_ref` — the two fields v1's first handler was built to, which
fail-closed every worktree spawn crew-wide (#2925). Those presences and absences are what
[`../envelope.golden.test.ts`](../envelope.golden.test.ts) pins. The values are illustrative — except
`tool_input.model`, whose alias spelling is itself part of what was captured.

## The limit, stated rather than implied

These fixtures freeze what 2.1.226 emitted on one machine on one day. Nothing in this repo can detect
the harness changing its envelope — no gate in this repo executes the real harness. A test
over a stale fixture goes green. Re-capture, by the method above, is the only way to refresh it, and a
re-capture updates this file in the same commit.
