/**
 * `hook plugin-sync` — advance the checkout a directory-source marketplace is served from, so the
 * next spawned shell's preloaded skill text is the text that landed.
 *
 * A `skills:` preload is rendered from the harness's **copy** of the plugin tree, and that copy is
 * taken from the marketplace's source directory at whatever commit that directory's primary worktree
 * sat at. So a skill-class merge binds a shell only after the source directory has advanced to it.
 * Nothing in the harness advances it — it is an ordinary git checkout — and for as long as that step
 * was a driver's to remember, a landed correction to a skill went on being invisible to every shell
 * spawned afterwards, silently: preloaded text names no version, so a shell cannot tell it is running
 * retired guidance. That window is what this verb closes, and it closes it by being a hook rather
 * than a step: the harness fires it, so there is nothing to forget.
 *
 * **It runs in the source directory's primary worktree, never in the session's own.** A linked
 * worktree is not what the harness copies, and moving the session's tree would be a mutation nobody
 * asked for. The primary worktree is read off `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute
 * --git-common-dir`, which every linked worktree of a clone answers with the one shared directory.
 *
 * **It takes fast-forwards and nothing else.** Every other state — a parked branch, a detached HEAD,
 * uncommitted work the incoming commits would write over, a diverged branch — is refused with its
 * reason on stderr, because where a human's checkout sits is a human's call. The refusal is the
 * loud half of the guarantee: a plugin source that has stopped advancing is precisely the state
 * that used to pass unnoticed. Uncommitted work **outside** the incoming commits' paths is not one
 * of those states: `git merge --ff-only` takes that move and leaves the work alone, and refusing it
 * left a checkout carrying one standing local-only edit behind forever.
 *
 * **The second link is reported, never driven.** Re-copying the advanced directory into the plugin
 * cache is the harness's own `autoUpdate` pass. This verb reads the harness's install records and
 * says which installs are still bound to an earlier commit, so a session is told in its own
 * transcript when the text it is about to load is not the text on the branch.
 *
 * Nothing here names a repository, a marketplace or a plugin. The marketplace is selected by the
 * directory it declares, so an adopting repo needs only to declare the hook.
