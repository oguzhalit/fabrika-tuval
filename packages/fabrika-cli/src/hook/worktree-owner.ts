/**
 * The one place `hook worktree-create` creates a worktree: every base fetch and every
 * `git worktree add` the hook runs goes through {@link createWorktree}.
 *
 * The order is the design:
 *
 *  1. Read the clone's common git dir and its default branch — reads, outside the lock.
 *  2. Take the repo-level creation lock (`creation-lock.ts`).
 *  3. Fetch the base into a per-spawn ref, resolve it to a commit, drop the ref, and
 *     `git worktree add --detach` at that commit **with hooks off**.
 *  4. Release the lock — on every exit path.
 *  5. Run the dependency install, **outside** the lock, so the installs of concurrent spawns overlap.
 *  6. Refuse unless the tree exists and its virtual store landed.
 *
 * The lock is what stops parallel spawns racing each other inside the hook. It holds only the fetch
 * and the add, which is what makes it affordable: the ~10s install that used to ride on
 * `post-checkout` inside the add now runs after the release.
 * @ruling https://github.com/kamp-us/phoenix/issues/7057
 *
 * Every failure arm refuses, and a refusal blocks the spawn: the harness reads any non-zero exit as a
 * creation failure and does not fall back to git, so a blocked spawn is the only honest alternative
 * to handing an agent a tree this owner could not finish.
