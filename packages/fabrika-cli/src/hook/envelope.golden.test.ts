/**
 * The fabrika hook surface, proven end to end against captured real payloads.
 *
 * Three things have to hold together for the surface to be real, and this file refuses to let any
 * one of them be assumed:
 *
 *   1. The **committed declaration** is what gets run. The argv comes out of
 *      `claude-plugins/fabrika/hooks.json` for the plugin surface and `.claude/settings.json` for
 *      this repo's own, never out of a literal here — so a test that passes cannot be exercising a
 *      verb the declaration does not name (the false-green this campaign keeps paying for). Which
 *      events each document may carry is asserted per document, because that split is a decision
 *      and not a filing convenience.
 *   2. The **bytes** are the captured ones. `__fixtures__/*.golden.json` are what Claude Code
 *      really wrote to a hook's stdin; `__fixtures__/PROVENANCE.md` says how, per build. A
 *      hand-authored envelope in the assertion path is what the capture rule exists to stop — the
 *      predecessor's spawn-guard test hand-authored a `PreToolUse` envelope and so never knew the
 *      harness sends `prompt_id`, `permission_mode` and `effort`.
 *   3. The **shape** is pinned by exact key set, presences and absences both. A subset check would
 *      pass against the fabricated shape too, which is the litmus the pattern doc sets.
