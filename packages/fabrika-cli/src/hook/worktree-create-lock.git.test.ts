/**
 * `hook worktree-create` run as the harness runs it — one process per spawn, several at once,
 * against one throwaway clone — with real git for the fetch and the add.
 *
 * The install is a stand-in: a `post-checkout` in the clone that writes `node_modules/.pnpm` and
 * sleeps, so the test can see whether the installs of concurrent spawns overlapped. Each stand-in
 * notes how many installs were in flight while it ran; a count above one is an overlap, which only
 * happens if the install runs outside the creation lock.
 *
 * `worktree-concurrency.git.test.ts` beside this file models the git sequence in-process; this file
 * is the lock, which only separate processes can contend for.
