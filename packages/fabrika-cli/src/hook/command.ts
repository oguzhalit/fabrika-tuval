/**
 * The `hook` verb group — `fabrika hook <verb>`.
 *
 * The adapter and nothing else: it declares the flags, runs the pure verb, and emits its outcome.
 * Every decision lives in `envelope.ts` / `check-verb.ts` beside it, which is what makes each refusal
 * testable without spawning a process.
 *
 * This group is what `claude-plugins/fabrika/hooks.json` declares against, so its verb names are part
 * of a committed hook declaration: renaming one is a change to the hook surface, not a refactor.
