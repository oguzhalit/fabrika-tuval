/**
 * `hook check` reads the SessionStart envelope; usage collection is a separate hook.
 *
 * It answers a single question: did a fabrika hook fire, and did the harness hand it an envelope
 * fabrika can read? That is a small answer on purpose. It is the surface's own proof, so it must not
 * depend on anything a later hook might change, and it must be able to run on any event.
 *
 * The answer is a **positive token**, never silence: a verb whose success is empty stdout is
 * byte-identical to a verb that never ran (cli-interface-convention rule 2). The scope it judged goes
 * to stderr on every path, so a verdict is never reported over unstated scope.
