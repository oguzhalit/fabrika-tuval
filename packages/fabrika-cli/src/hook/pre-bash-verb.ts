/**
 * `hook pre-bash` — the one fabrika hook that decides something.
 *
 * It refuses a Bash command that opens with a directory jump out of the linked worktree it was
 * issued in. The decision itself is `./leading-jump.ts`, which is IO-free and carries the why; this
 * file is the envelope routing and the working-tree probe around it.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing and none of them is a style choice:
 *
 * - **The verdict travels as JSON on stdout, never as an exit code.** `2` is the harness's one
 *   blocking `PreToolUse` code and fabrika allocates it nowhere (`./harness-exit.ts`), so a deny
 *   rides `permissionDecision` at exit 0 and every refusal below exits non-blocking.
 * - **It arms only inside a linked worktree.** The primary checkout has nothing to escape from, and
 *   fabrika holds no opinion on which tree an operator works in — isolation is their call, made at
 *   spawn time. What is judged is leaving an isolated tree, not standing in one.
 * - **A ground it cannot establish fails open and loud.** An unprobeable cwd is a state in which
 *   nothing was judged, and a guard that never judged may not deny (`hook-surface.md`, *The
 *   dispatch-failure policy point*) — so it seats {@link GROUND_UNKNOWN}, whose stderr the user sees
 *   while the command proceeds.
