/**
 * `hook worktree-create`'s base resolution under **parallel spawns**, driven against real git in a
 * throwaway clone.
 *
 * The claim under test is not one about argv — it is one about what git does when several spawns
 * fetch the same clone at once, so it is run rather than reasoned about (CLAUDE.md: ground platform
 * claims in a real run). The old shape read `FETCH_HEAD`, which is one file in the shared `.git` dir:
 * a sibling's fetch truncates it mid-read and the loser's spawn dies on `fatal: invalid reference:
 * FETCH_HEAD`. Measured here on git 2.40.1 before the fix, 12 of 320 concurrent fetch-then-resolve
 * pairs came back empty; point {@link fetchBaseArgs} back at `FETCH_HEAD` and this file goes red.
 *
 * The per-spawn ref that fixed it left a second, rarer race on the directory those names *shared*,
 * which surfaced here as an intermittent `cannot lock ref`. That one is settled by where
 * {@link baseRefFor} puts its leaf, so it is pinned in the last describe rather than raced for: the
 * observed rate was one loss in 320 pairs, far below what this file's load would catch reliably.
 *
 * What is exercised is the derivation the verb performs — the argv from {@link fetchBaseArgs},
 * {@link resolveBaseArgs} and {@link dropBaseRefArgs}, and the guard in {@link isCommitId}. The
 * Effect wrapper around them folds the same pieces over a scripted spawner elsewhere; running it
 * here would mean standing up a spawner layer per concurrent spawn to prove a property that is
 * git's, not Effect's.
 *
 * `git worktree add` is deliberately **not** in the loop. It carries two concurrency faults of its
 * own — a sibling's null-oid `worktrees/<name>/HEAD` placeholder breaking a concurrent fetch's
 * connectivity check, and `failed to read …/commondir` between two adds — so including it would make
 * this file red for reasons it is not judging. Those two are `worktree-concurrency.git.test.ts`'s
 * subject, over the same {@link openClone} fixture.
