/**
 * The decisions behind `hook worktree-create`, with no subprocess and no fd in sight.
 *
 * `WorktreeCreate` is a **provider** hook: the harness hands it a slug and expects the worktree to
 * exist and its path on stdout when the hook exits 0 (`../../../../claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/hook-surface.md`).
 * `worktree-owner.ts` runs the git commands, and everything it has to get *right* before it runs
 * them — where the tree goes, what each command's arguments are, what the child's `PATH` must carry
 * — is decided here, where a unit test can drive it.
 *
 * Two facts this module encodes are captured, not assumed: the payload carries `cwd` and `name` and
 * **no** `worktree_path` or `base_ref`, and the path is therefore *constructed* rather than read.
 * `__fixtures__/worktree-create.payload.golden.json` is the capture.
 *
 * `cwd` is the session's working directory, which is not always the repository root and not always
 * the primary checkout. So it makes a {@link WorktreeRequest} and never a plan: {@link locateToplevel}
 * proves it stands in a working tree, and only {@link planAtPrimary}, handed that clone's worktree
 * listing, composes a {@link WorktreePlan}.

 * Where this spawn's fetched base lands — a ref **no sibling spawn can write**, under a directory
 * **no sibling spawn can remove**.
 *
 * `FETCH_HEAD` is one file in the shared `.git` dir and every parallel spawn fetches against the same
 * clone, so one spawn reads it while a sibling's fetch has it truncated and the read returns nothing.
 * Measured on git 2.40.1 in this repo's `worktree-base.git.test.ts` fixture: 12 of 320 concurrent
 * fetch-then-resolve pairs lost the base that way. Serializing the pair would fix it too, but a
 * per-spawn name removes the shared write instead of taking turns at it.
 *
 * A per-spawn *name* left a shared *directory*, which is a second race. `git update-ref -d`
 * deletes the loose ref and then walks upward removing every parent it just emptied — but its walk
 * has a floor: `try_remove_empty_parents` in git's `refs/files-backend.c` advances its pointer past
 * the refname's first **two** components — the `for (i = 0; i < 2; i++)` loop commented
 * `refs/{heads,tags,...}` — before pruning anything, identical on v2.40.1 and v2.51.0. So the
 * deepest directory it can ever remove is the third
 * component's. The leaf therefore sits directly in `refs/fabrika/`, which is component two and out of
 * reach; a nested `refs/fabrika/worktree-base/<leaf>` put the shared directory one level lower, where
 * the last spawn to finish rmdir'd it out from under a sibling's in-flight `git fetch` — between that
 * fetch's mkdir and its `<leaf>.lock` create — and the sibling died on `cannot lock ref … No such file
 * or directory`. Measured across 720 concurrent spawns against one clone on git 2.40.1: nested, the
 * shared directory was absent in 363 of 4635 polls; flat under `refs/fabrika/`, 0 of 4894.
 *
 * `concurrencyArm` deliberately does not classify that diagnostic: this shape removes the race rather
 * than recovering from it, and prune-and-backoff would not have helped a fetch whose parent directory
 * was gone.
 *
 * The slug is folded to `[A-Za-z0-9-]` so it cannot carry a `..` or a `.lock` suffix into a refname,
 * and the nonce — not the slug — is what makes the name unique: two slugs that differ only in
 * punctuation fold together, which would put the shared write straight back.

/**
 * The two ways one spawn's `git worktree add` breaks a **sibling** spawn's git command against the

 *
 * `PlaceholderHead` — `git worktree add` writes `.git/worktrees/<name>/HEAD` as a null-oid
 * placeholder before it checks out, and any concurrent `git fetch`'s connectivity check walks every
 * worktree HEAD and reds on it: `fatal: bad object worktrees/<name>/HEAD`.
 *
 * `IncompleteAdminDir` — an add reading another add's half-written administrative directory:
 * `fatal: failed to read .git/worktrees/<name>/commondir`.
 *
 * The name in each diagnostic is the *sibling's* worktree, never the failing spawn's own, which is
 * what separates these from a genuine failure naming the tree it was asked to build. The per-spawn
 * base ref fixed neither, because neither is about what the base is named.
 *
 * **Each arm has two sources** — both measured in `worktree-concurrency.git.test.ts`, each with the
 * git it was measured on:
 *
 *  - A **live** sibling add, which holds the state for the length of its creation window and then
 *    replaces it. Short, on git 2.40.1: one sample in 161 over a ~320ms creation, and it closes
 *    *before* the `post-checkout` install, so it never spans that ~10s.
 *  - A **dead** sibling add, which left its administrative directory behind. Whether that entry
 *    heals on its own is git's own business and moves between versions: on git 2.40.1 it never does
 *    — a re-run of the identical fetch fails identically for as long as the directory is there —
 *    while on git 2.55.0, this repo's CI runner, the second fetch succeeds. It is the shape the
 *    original report measured in production, where every failing fetch named one worktree — the
 *    first spawn's, whose own add had failed earlier in the same run.
 *
 * So the recovery is {@link pruneWorktreesArgs} *and* a bounded re-attempt, never a re-attempt
 * alone: prune clears the dead sibling's leftover on both gits measured, where a bare re-attempt
 * clears it on only one of them, and the backoff waits out the live one.
 *
 * **The creation lock narrows both arms and removes neither.** It serializes this hook's own fetches
 * and adds, so a spawn of this hook can no longer be the live sibling another one trips on. It does
 * not reach a `git worktree add` that runs outside the hook — the harness's internal path, a human, a
 * `review-head materialize` — and it cannot clear a leftover a dead add already wrote. Both arms stay
 * named, and the recovery stays.
