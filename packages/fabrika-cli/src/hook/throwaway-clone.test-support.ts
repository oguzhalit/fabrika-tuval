 * A throwaway `origin` + clone on disk, for the two real-git tests that judge what git does when

 * Not a test itself and not under `__fixtures__/`, which holds captured payloads rather than code.
 * It lives here because both concurrency files need the identical clone: a fixture that differs
 * between them would let one file's green rest on a repo shape the other never exercises. The
 * `.test-support.ts` suffix is what `tsconfig.build.json` excludes, so it stays out of `dist/`.
