/**
 * The one exit table every `hook` verb allocates from.
 *
 * `hook codes` exposes {@link HOOK_EXIT_TABLE}; each verb's `--help` names the codes it exits on.
 *
 * **`2` is allocated by nothing, here or in any other group, and this is the group that makes it a
 * hard rule.** On `PreToolUse` exit `2` is the harness's one blocking code (`./harness-exit.ts`), so
 * a fabrika verb that seats any meaning on it denies a tool call as a side effect of its exit
 * status. `NO_IMPLEMENTATION` used to sit there, which made a fabrika that could not bootstrap block
 * every `Task`/`Workflow` spawn — the inverse of the ruled polarity, where a hook whose verb never
 * ran fails open and lets the harness event proceed.
 *
 * {@link EMPTY_STDIN} is *imported* from `report`, not restated as `3`: it is the same fact the
 * writing verbs already seat there, so the alignment is by identity rather than by assertion
 * (`../exit-code-alignment.ts`). The two private seats sit at `12`+ because everything below is
 * occupied in the base table.
 *
 * Note what is NOT here: a seat for "the verb never ran". `127` is the shell's, and a dispatch that
 * never reached this process cannot allocate from a table this process owns — which is exactly why
 * the dispatch-failure policy lives in the hook declaration and not in a verb
 * (`claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/hook-surface.md`, *The dispatch-failure policy point*).
