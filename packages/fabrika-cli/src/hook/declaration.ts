/**
 * Read a hook declaration and judge it against the two rules that fix the surface.
 *
 * Two documents declare fabrika hooks and both are read here, because rule 5 binds a declared
 * command wherever it is written: `claude-plugins/fabrika/hooks.json` is the **plugin** surface,
 * which travels to every adopting repo, and a repo's own `.claude/settings.json` carries the one
 * event the plugin surface may not — that event is declared only where the repo guarantees the
 * toolchain it needs. They share this shape exactly, so one reader serves both — what differs is
 * which events each may declare, which the golden test asserts per document.
 *
 * This exists so the declaration is checked as *data* rather than by a reviewer's eye. The rules are
 * not restated here — they are cli-interface-convention rule 5 (a plain literal command string, and
 * the literal is `fabrika`) and rule 6 (fabrika calls nothing outside fabrika). What this module
 * adds is the machine-checkable form of each.
 *
 * {@link declaredHooks} is also what binds the surface's test to the surface itself: the golden test
 * runs the argv it reads *out of the committed declaration*, so a test that passes can never be
 * exercising a verb the declaration does not name.
