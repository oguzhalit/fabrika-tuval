/**
 * `hook worktree-create`'s git sequence, `git worktree add` included, against real git in a
 * throwaway clone.
 *
 * `worktree-base.git.test.ts` beside this file judges the base resolution and deliberately keeps the
 * add out of its loop, because the add carries faults the base-resolution fix never covered. This
 * file is those faults: the two administrative-state arms {@link concurrencyArm} names, and the
 * recovery that clears them.
 *
 * **The fan here takes no creation lock, on purpose.** The hook's own spawns now serialize their
 * fetch and add (`worktree-create-lock.git.test.ts` runs them as real processes), but the arms still
 * fire from an add the lock does not reach — a dead add's leftover, or a `git worktree add` run
 * outside the hook. An unlocked fan is that sibling, so it is the case the recovery still exists for.
 *
 * **What this file exercises is the derivation, not the Effect wrapper** — the same split
 * `worktree-base.git.test.ts` documents. The loop in {@link provision} is the shape
 * `withConcurrencyRecovery` folds over a spawner in `worktree-owner.ts`, and its decisions —
 * which diagnostics are recoverable, whether to prune, how many attempts and how long to wait — are
 * imported from the module under test rather than restated, so a change to any of them moves this
 * file too.
 *
 * **The demonstration is injected, not raced for, and that is the point.** The original report
 * read the arm out of a timing race, and a test that waits for one is a test that hangs on the
 * machine where it never fires. The state is reproduced directly instead — the exact
 * administrative directory a failed `git worktree add` leaves — so the fault fires on every git
 * measured without waiting for anything. The unlocked fan below still drives the race, and holds
 * that no spawn is lost whether or not a window opens.
 *
 * **One thing about that planted state is version-dependent, and it is asserted as a choice between
 * the two behaviours measured rather than as the one this machine has.** Whether a *bare* re-run
 * clears the leftover entry is git's own business: on git 2.40.1 it never does, and on git 2.55.0
 * the second identical fetch succeeds. Pinning either reds the other machine, and asserting nothing
 * would let an unmeasured third behaviour through, so the test below admits exactly those two and
 * names `gitVersion()` in its failure message. What holds on both — and is what the recovery rests
 * on — is that pruning then re-attempting clears it.
 *
 * **Measured in this file** (`gitVersion()` is printed into every skip and into the version-split
 * assertion); the version each measurement holds on is named with it:
 *  - a leftover administrative directory fails the next fetch on both gits measured; a *bare*
 *    re-run keeps failing on git 2.40.1 and succeeds on git 2.55.0;
 *  - on git 2.40.1, macOS: a live add holds `worktrees/<name>/locked` = `initializing` across its
 *    creation window, so `git worktree prune` cannot deregister it;
 *  - on git 2.40.1, macOS: the placeholder HEAD closes before `post-checkout`, so the live window
 *    never spans the install.
 *
 * **What the production trace can retain.** Nothing here confirms the six `fail: git fetch origin
 * main` entries the original report read out of the hook trace, and what this
 * change can promise is bounded by the `WorktreeCreate` contract — quoted verbatim in
 * `claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/hook-surface.md` under *`WorktreeCreate` — a provider hook, left
 * undeclared*. That entry gives stdout one meaning, the worktree path, and says of the rest only
 * `Exit code 0 - worktree created successfully` / `Other exit codes - worktree creation failed`. It
 * makes no statement about a hook's stderr, unlike the `WorktreeRemove` entry beside it, which does.
 * So nothing in the contract retains a *recovered* arm's diagnostic — the case this change creates —
 * and that is left unclaimed rather than inferred from the `PreToolUse` exit-code table, which the
 * same doc warns carries different meanings per event.
 *
 * What is retained is the *exhausted* arm, and on fabrika's own surface rather than the harness's:
 * the refusal keeps git's own line plus the cause it lost to, and the same doc reproduces the
 * harness surfacing a failed `WorktreeCreate` hook's output live (`Error creating worktree:
 * WorktreeCreate hook failed: …`). So a future `BASE_FETCH_FAILED` that really is this fault says so
 * in its own text. The six old entries stay what the report called them, an inference from shape.
 * This PR reclassifies none of them, and the shape it measured — every failing fetch naming one
 * worktree, the first spawn's, whose own add had already failed — is consistent with that inference
 * without proving it.
