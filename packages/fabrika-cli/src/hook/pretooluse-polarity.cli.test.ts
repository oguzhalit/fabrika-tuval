/**
 * The ruled polarity, pinned as a test: a fabrika that cannot bootstrap must not block a spawn.
 *
 * On `PreToolUse` exit `2` is the harness's one blocking code (`./harness-exit.ts`), and the
 * bootstrap/dispatch failures sat on it — so a fabrika install that could not resolve itself denied
 * every `Task`/`Workflow` spawn in the session, the exact inverse of the ruled fail-open.
 * Nothing in the type system stops that seat being taken again, so it is pinned in the two places it
 * can come back: the **exit code a real process returns**, and the **literals the bootstrap sources
 * carry**.
 *
 * The end-to-end leg runs the argv out of a committed `hooks.json` declaration rather than a
 * literal, for the same reason the golden test does: a pass must not be able to exercise a verb the
 * surface does not name. It drives the `SessionStart` row — the property under test is the *exit
 * code* a cannot-run fabrika returns, which is the same whichever hook consulted it, and the code
 * must stay off `2`. That is no longer a precaution against a future declaration: `hook pre-bash`
 * is declared on `PreToolUse` today, so a denying bootstrap would block every Bash call in the
 * session. And it reaches a
 * refusal for real rather than mocking one — a temp directory made into a repo root that resolves a
 * *different* `@kampus/fabrika-cli` is the cross-checkout state, measured on real worktrees, and it
 * belongs to any worktree whose install resolves outside its own checkout.
 *
 * `../delegate/foreign-checkout.cli.test.ts` spawns the same state and asserts a different property:
 * that the refusal happens at all, and that the cwd's install never answers. This file asserts what
 * the refusal costs a *hook* — that its exit code cannot deny the spawn the hook was consulted about.
