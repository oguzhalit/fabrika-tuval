# 0108 — Database migrations are hand-authored and flat

**What this decides:** Migrations are written by hand, numbered, and never regenerated.

## Context
A generated migration hides what it does to live data.

## Decision
**Migrations are hand-authored SQL in a flat numbered sequence.**

## Consequences
More typing, readable history.
