/**
 * Release-time bundle for @kampus/fabrika-pi (ADR 0332).
 *
 * Copies the single authored sources into `dist/` so the published package carries real copies and
 * the manifest keys (`pi.skills`, `pi.subagents.agents`) point at bundled paths:
 *
 *   claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/<skill>/…  →  dist/skills/<skill>/…
 *   agents/<shell>.md                        →  dist/agents/<shell>.md
 *
 * The single-source rule (#6985): nothing here is hand-maintained — skills are authored only in
 * `claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/`, agent shells only in this package's `agents/` (they are
 * pi-specific authored content, not consumer wiring), and this script is the only thing that
 * produces the bundled copies. Editing anything under `dist/` by hand is lost on the next sync.
 *
 * Fail-closed, mirroring #6967's sync: a source tree that yields zero skills or zero agents is a
 * moved or emptied source, and bundling nothing would publish a package whose manifest points at
 * nothing — so the script refuses instead. The sync is total: `dist/` is removed and rebuilt on
 * every run, so running twice is idempotent and stale copies of deleted sources never survive.
