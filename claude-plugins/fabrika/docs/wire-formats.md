# fabrika wire formats — the index

A **wire format** is the byte-level agreement two fabrika skills meet through on a GitHub artifact.
This page is the map of them: for each registered format, its owner module, who writes those bytes
and who reads them, and why the two sides need an agreement at all.

It is a map, never the territory. **The shape lives in the owner module and is cited here, never
restated** — no fields, no example bytes, no heading spellings, no exit codes. A shape copied into
prose is the v1 failure this whole arrangement replaces, and it drifts silently the first time the
module moves. Where you want the shape, open the module. The rule behind that — a wire format's
shape is owned by one schema module and cited everywhere else — is what this page follows rather
than re-derives, per [`README.md`](README.md).

The **live** list is the registry itself —
[`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/registry.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/registry.ts),
one row per format — and `fabrika wire formats` projects it at runtime
([`wire/command.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/command.ts)). Run that verb when you need
the current inventory; read this page when you need to know what the agreement is *for*.

`fabrika wire --help` lists the group's other verbs: `emit`, `read`, `check`, `doc-section` and
`codes`.

The two cannot quietly disagree any more. The table below is **generated from the registry** by
`fabrika wire index --write`, and `fabrika wire index` reds when it has gone stale, when a registered
format has no section here, or when a section here names no registered format. The narrative under
each heading is the hand-written half — it is the part no registry row holds.

## The staging rule

A format lands **with its first consumer**, never in a batch: a format absent from the table below
is almost certainly *unwritten* — its consumer does not exist yet — rather than missing, and the
registry is the place to check before assuming a gap. Building a format ahead of its first consumer
is banned: with no reader to hold it honest, the shape is a guess, and the first real consumer
arrives owing a migration nobody planned.

### `audit-context`

Audit research survives a conversation in the initial session body. The audit producer and the
grilling reader share this format so retries can compare retained research without treating a
recommendation as a ruling. Session creation and recovery belong to the grilling contract.

### `acceptance-criteria`

This is the checkbox contract a gate grades a PR against, carried on the sub-issue body. The two
sides never meet: the skill that writes the criteria has long finished by the time a gate reads them
back, and the only thing connecting them is the block's placement in a body neither one owns
outright. The producer touches it once, at intake or at decomposition; the consumers touch it twice
more, when a coder builds to it and when a reviewer grades against it. A block that has shifted out
of recognition reads back as *a body with no criteria* — byte-identical to a body that genuinely
has none — and the module-owned total read is what reports that drift as `Malformed` instead of
returning a plausible empty answer.

A criterion may also carry the **outside-diff evidence marker**, a trailing `[evidence: <source>]`
naming where its proof lives when the diff's bytes cannot settle it either way. It is a field of
this format rather than prose a grader has to recognise, which is what lets the two sides disagree
about nothing: `triage` writes it at mint time, when the author still knows the proof is a
hand-verification, and `review` reads it back and grades that row on the evidence it names. Without
it the grader had one rule for every row, so a criterion no diff could discharge read as
undischarged and undischarged read as FAIL. A marker whose keyword drifted in case, or which names
no source, is `Malformed` for the same reason a drifted heading is.

### `deviations`

This is what a PR body discloses about where the build departed from its contract — the `##
Deviations` section, carried as four-field entries or the literal `None.`. The entry shape is owned
once, in this format's schema module, and both sides resolve it there; the producing verb runs the
consumer-side read before posting, so a section the review gate would reject is refused where the
body is written, not a round later. The obligation behind it is that a build discloses its
departures in the PR body — the one surface the merge record keeps. A repair round **replaces**
the section rather than appending to it: the section describes the change at the reviewed head, not
a round-tagged log of every round.

The read is total over three answers where the section has four meanings, so `None.` is a `Found`
carrying a tag of its own rather than an empty entry list. That is the load-bearing distinction:
`None.` is a *checked* claim — an author who considered the question and has nothing to disclose —
and folding it into `Absent` is how "never considered it" comes to read as "nothing to disclose".
An entry states all four fields. The label is a routing hint and stays optional, but a disclosure
missing *Why* or *Disposition* states what changed without stating whether anyone accepted it.

### `build-deviations`

This is the deviations disclosure for a build that opens no PR — an epic run's child, which lands by
merging into the assembly branch, and so has no PR body to carry the `## Deviations`
section above. The disclosure lands as a marker comment on the child's own issue,
`build-deviations: #<issue>` over the same `## Deviations` section a PR body carries, and the
epic-tail review — the one gate the run's single PR passes — reads every landed child's comment from
there. The producer is the child's build shell, at the moment it would have opened a PR; the
consumer is the tail review, which reaches each comment through the PR body's closing references.
The section's grammar is not restated here or in the module: everything under the marker line is
delegated wholesale to the `deviations` owner module, because two readers of the four-field bullet
is the disagreement that format exists to remove. What this format adds is the marker line binding
the disclosure to the issue it sits on — a comment pasted onto the wrong issue reads as a mismatch,
not a disclosure — and the Absent/Malformed split for comments: an ordinary comment is `Absent`,
while a marker line whose promised section is missing or drifted is `Malformed`, so a tail reviewer
cannot mistake a broken disclosure for a child with nothing to say.

One marker per issue, enforced at the write seam. The `deviations` reader counts conforming `##
Deviations` headings and refuses two as undecidable, so a stacked marker leaves the tail review
reading `malformed`; and because `wire read` judges bytes on stdin and cannot see which comment is
newer, the one-marker rule lives where the bytes are written — `fabrika build deviations <issue>`
edits the standing marker in place and retracts any superseded one, and it is the only sanctioned
way this marker is posted. Editing in place puts the whole-range completeness of the disclosure at
that same seam: the verb compares each replacement against the standing one and refuses a section
that drops an entry, because a reader of these bytes sees only the round that wrote them.

### `report`

This is what a PR author states in answer to an acceptance criterion that asks for a report: an
audit's scope, why a duplication was kept, the overlap with another ticket. No diff holds such a
statement, so it is carried in the PR body under `## Report` and the review gate grades the
criterion from that section. The content is free prose, since what a report holds is the criterion's
to say. The grammar is the heading (level 2, that spelling) over a non-empty section that runs to
the next level-1 or level-2 heading, so an author's own `###` subheadings stay inside it.

Most PRs answer no such criterion and owe no section, so `Absent` is an ordinary answer here and
only `Malformed` is a defect. The reach is narrow on purpose: a heading reaches for the section
when its text, case and punctuation aside, is `report` or `reports`, so `## Test report` is the
author's own heading and reads `Absent`. The verbs that post a PR body run this read and refuse a
`Malformed` section, so a drifted heading is caught where the body is written, and a reviewer who
reads `Absent` holds a proven fact about the body.

An epic child opens no PR, so it has no body to carry the section. No format serves a report there
yet.

### `verdict-marker`

This is the first line of a gate's verdict comment on a PR, and the artifact the merge decision
rests on. A gate writes it once, when it finishes reviewing; a repairing coder reads it to learn
whether it owes a fix, and a shipper reads it to learn whether it may merge. The marker attests the
tree the verdict was formed over: the head the reviewer inspected is bound into it, and a marker
bound to a head that has since moved is stale rather than passing. A marker the readers cannot
recognise makes a reviewed PR look unreviewed and stalls it; one whose binding is lost would let a
stale approval carry an unreviewed tree through a merge. The module owns the composing and the
reading, including the staleness question; the skills keep the judgement of when to flip a verdict.

### `range-verdict-marker`

This is the same verdict over a commit range instead of a pull request head — what a child's local
review judges on its own branch, posted on the child issue. The head binding above cannot survive
the range being merged into the epic branch: at that moment the SHAs the verdict names stop being
that branch's history, and a reader holding only those SHAs would have to re-review work nobody
changed. So this form drops the head and makes the **content digest mandatory** — the twelve hex of
the same content serialization a head-bound verdict carries, over the same `<base>...<tip>`
records. A clean merge that preserves every judged blob leaves that digest derivable from the epic
branch and the verdict in force; a conflict resolution, or any later commit touching a judged path,
moves it and kills the verdict — the re-review that is owed. A marker of this form written with no
digest binds nothing at all, so it is malformed rather than a weaker verdict — the one place this
format is stricter than the head-bound one.

### `lane-brief`

This is the spawn prompt a lane driver hands one fabrika shell, and it is the whole interface
between the machine and the work. Written per dispatch, two drivers driving the same state send
materially different instructions, so the format owns the rules text byte for byte and the state →
shell routing table with it, and `lane brief` prints what it derives instead of composing anything.
Both the section set and the field set are closed, and each field belongs to exactly one section —
`## Task` owns `lane`, `root`, `fabrika`, `task`, `state` and `shell`, `## Ground` owns `issue`,
`pr`, `epic`, `branch`, `range` and `owner-comments`. An unknown key, a key under the wrong heading, or a key set twice
under its own heading is malformed: a misplaced key would quietly beat the one the driver's fold
derived and re-route the brief to a shell `## Task` never named. `## Ground` carries links and no
content at all: the shell re-reads its own issue, PR and verdicts through its own verbs. A `review`
or `ship` brief with no PR is malformed rather than dispatchable, because that shell would have
nothing to read. The machine this brief serves is the lane state machine, and the machine is the
authority on which state routes to which shell — not this page.

Ground comes in three shapes, because an epic run is one branch and one pull request. A
child state on an epic lane has no PR to name at all: it carries the epic issue, the branch its
worktree is cut from, and — at `review` — the commit range whose verdict lands on the child issue as
a `range-verdict-marker`. Both of that range's endpoints are commits the driver's tree already
resolved, never a `HEAD` the spawned shell resolves for itself: a reviewer's worktree is cut fresh
from the driver's checkout and stands on the assembly branch, where a `HEAD`-tipped range reads as
empty. Those briefs carry a second byte-fixed rules paragraph saying so, so a child brief holding
only the single-issue rules — the one that would let a child push and open its own PR — reads back
malformed. The run's tail task is the PR shape again at `review` and `ship`. Its `build` — the repair
round the tail review's `FAIL` retries into — is the third shape: the PR *and* the assembly branch
that PR's head sits on, under a rules paragraph of its own saying the branch is the lane driver's to
move and that a stale trunk is merged in, never rebased. A branch beside a PR is what tells the two
tail shapes apart, and it is the only ground that carries both.

`owner-comments` rides beside any of those shapes on a build or review brief. It lists, as
space-separated URLs, the comments a control-plane account wrote on the issue that no ruling marker
records and that are newer than the newest recorded ruling. A rule an owner wrote as a plain comment
reached no shell before: the brief carried the issue and nothing said the comment existed. The field
has three states. Absent is the proven zero and changes no byte of the brief. A list appends a
byte-fixed rule telling the shell to read each one. `unknown` says the read behind the field failed
and appends a rule saying so, because a blank there would read as none. The field never carries a
comment's text, and a `ship` brief carrying it is malformed. Nothing in it makes a comment a ruling:
the graded set stays the body plus the marked rulings.

### `map-ticket`

This is how a wayfinding frontier ticket says which map it belongs to. The load-bearing field is the
map number, and it is load-bearing because the alternative already exists and is not trustworthy: a
ticket is linked to its map by a native sub-issue edge, and **anyone with write access can add that
edge to anything**. A reader that derived the frontier from edges alone would count a stranger's
issue as one of the map's open questions, and it would look perfectly well-formed doing it. So the
marker is the claim and the edge is only the link; a ticket whose marker names a different map is
disregarded with the mismatch reported, not silently dropped and not silently counted.

The nonce is the filing run's, not a session's: a session id is pane-constant and shared across
sibling subagents, so two lanes of one charting run would key onto one namespace and each would
read the other's marker as its own.

### `grill-ruling`

This is the first line of the comment that records an approver's ruling on one grilling
question, and it is the only marker a reader may resolve to `ruled`. The agreement it closes is
an authority one: a comment claiming a decision is byte-indistinguishable from one carrying it,
because every agent writes to GitHub as the same account, so nothing in the prose can settle who
decided. The marker therefore carries no claim about itself at all — it names a question and the
digest of the round text it answered, and the reader settles authority against repository
permissions and against a dated authorization comment beside it. The digest is what keeps the
ruling honest over time: re-word the question and the recomputed digest differs, so the ruling
stops counting and the question is open again. A ruling that drifted out from under its approver
must never keep reading as theirs.

### `cap-clearance`

This is an approver's grant of one extra repair round, carried on the pull request the round belongs
to. The marker names the round it clears and nothing else — deliberately no head SHA, because a
clearance exists so a *new* head can be pushed, and a head-bound grant would be void the moment it
was used. Naming the round is also what spends it exactly once: the grant covers the round it names,
and the next FAIL round leaves it behind. Like the ruling marker, it is not authority on its own —
the reader settles that against the repo's control-plane set (`.github/CODEOWNERS`) and a dated authorization
comment beside it.

### `takeover-grant`

This is the grant that hands a pull request another author opened to the pipeline. A pull request
belongs to its author: `build` will not repair it, `ship` will not land it and `heal-ci` routes it to
its author, unless its author is one of the repo's own accounts (`ownAccounts`, or the running
account alone when that set is empty) or this marker stands on it. The marker names the pull request
it hands over, so a grant read on any other thread grants nothing, and the lines under it quote the
dated authorization it rests on. Like the clearance marker it is not authority on its own: the
reader counts it only when its author is in the repo's control-plane set (the owners
`.github/CODEOWNERS` names on the default branch), holds `write+`, and is not the pull request's own
author.

### `grill-answer`

These bytes are the agent's own record of a fact it established, never a ruling: a reader that
resolves an approver decision looks for the other key and finds nothing here. Keeping them apart as
two formats rather than one polarity field means a reader never has to parse a field to learn which
kind of authority it is holding. Its digest is informational: it records which text was answered so
a later reader can see the question moved, and it never changes the state.

### `grill-supersede`

This is the comment that retires questions, one line per question, written after the round that
replaced them. It asserts no answer at all — only that a question is no longer the one the session
turns on. A re-worded question is un-ruled, so without retirement it would hold the frontier open
forever. Two details carry weight. Its digest is the **retired** question's round, captured at
retirement, because the marker's job is to record which text was removed. And the record is a **new comment, never an edit** to the round it retires: editing that
round would change text its digest covers, breaking every ruling bound to it.

### `handoff-pack`

This is one session's handoff to the next, as a single comment, and it crosses the widest boundary in
the corpus: the two sides share no memory, no checkout and possibly no machine. That is why it is
registered rather than kept private to its group — the three-answer read is what the boundary needs,
because a malformed pack read as an absent one tells a successor nobody handed off and it starts the
work over. Its shape is two halves under one marker. The four asserted sections are the model's own
words and are labelled as assertion, so a consumer cannot mistake them for a derived fact; the single
proven section holds one fenced JSON object the verb derived itself, which is what keeps a successor
from inheriting the previous session's premise. The section set is **closed**, and that is the whole
injection defence: an extra heading or a sentence appended after the fence is a refusal, because an
artifact whose section set is open can steer its receiver past the artifact and the receiver has no
way to tell the format's own words from someone else's. Its digest is over the proven half's fields
rather than over the comment text, and a reader recomputes it — a pack comment is editable by its
author, so two printed copies of a number nobody recomputes can drift with nothing marking it.

### `governance-digest`

This is the periodic readout of the decision records that landed in a window — the non-blocking half
of the ruling that retired the human gate on ADRs, so it carries no polarity and nothing about it can
red. Each row is an id, one of three closed kinds (`tension`, `blast`, `routine`) and a one-line note,
ranked highest consequence first. The note is a **pointer, not a directive**: the receiver re-fetches
the record the id names and reads it there, which is what keeps a coordination artifact from steering
whoever reads it, and it is why free prose is confined to that one field. The block is upserted onto a
durable issue rather than appended, so a reader always finds exactly one current readout instead of a
stream a timestamp has to decide between.

### `graduate-emitted`

This is the record on a grilling session or a wayfinding map that one spec issue was graduated out of
it, and the agreement it closes is a repeat one: without it, a second run over the same trail cannot
tell a spec that already exists from one nobody has filed, so it files a duplicate. Two fields carry
the design. The digest it binds is the **spec**'s, not the trail's — a trail deliberately split across
two buildable things graduates its remainder later at a different digest, and a marker bound to the
trail would refuse that second filing forever while claiming to prevent duplicates. And `covers`
names the refs the spec rendered, which is what makes coverage answerable from the artifact alone: a
digest by itself is opaque, so a reader holding one could say a source had graduated but not which
parts of its trail were specified. Its separator is `;` rather than `,`: a map-sourced ref already
carries a space (`#<map> R1.2`), and `;` keeps the refs visually apart where a run-on `,` list would
not.

It is a new format rather than a widening of `verdict-marker`. That reader is guarded by a separate
namespace-prefix gate that returns `Absent` for a non-member, so a widening that missed either
constant would emit markers it could never read back; an emission also carries no `PASS`/`FAIL`
polarity, binds a spec digest rather than a head SHA, and nothing recorded in it can block a merge.

### `came-from`

This is the section saying which issue an artifact's question arrived from, and it is the only thing
carrying a `wayfinding` frontier ticket number into a sibling skill. `spike open` writes it on a
spike issue and `grill open` writes it on a session issue; `grill open` also *reads* it, because for
a session the binding is the resume key. That is the whole reason it is a format rather than a
grammar either group owns: two writers and two readers across two skills, and a reader drifting from
a writer here is silent.

`standalone` is a value rather than a blank, so an artifact opened with no ticket says so instead of
leaving a reader to infer it from an empty section. And the `Malformed` answer is load-bearing beyond
the usual: a session whose heading drifted, answered as "bound to nothing", would make the resume
find no match and mint a **second** session on one ticket — silently, where the failure it replaced
was at least a visibly duplicate topic. `grill open` refuses on that answer rather than resuming
past it.

### `plan-approval`

This is a control-plane human's approval of one epic's plan, carried as a marker comment on the epic
itself. What makes it a format rather than a label is the digest: it binds the ledger scope the plan
gate re-derives, so a plan rewritten after the approver read it no longer matches and does not
inherit the approval. The epic is named on the marker too, because bytes travel — a comment
quoting another epic's approval must never read as this one's, and `approves` checks both halves as
equality rather than either as a courtesy. Like the ruling and clearance markers, it is not authority on its own, and both sides of
the format are what makes that true: the writer resolves the `@<org>/<team>` roster before it posts,
and the reader resolves it again over the marker's author before it reports `current`. Only the
second half covers the bytes that reach the epic some other way, which is every account that can
comment on it — so an off-roster marker reads `absent` however fresh its digest.

### `decision-ruling`

This is the same mechanism as `plan-approval` over a second surface, and it reuses that format's
binding walk rather than restating it: a control-plane human's ruling on **any** issue, carried as a
marker comment on the issue, with the number and a digest in the bytes for the same two reasons.
What differs is the subject and two extra fields. The digest binds the **issue body** that was ruled
on, so a re-scoped question no longer inherits its ruling; the marker names the comment the ruling is
actually written in, which is what makes it worth more than a label — a builder picking the issue up
reads that human's own words at that URL instead of inferring the choice from a thread, and it is the
value `build claim --cites` takes; and the optional `supersedes:<k>` names the **1-based** body
acceptance criterion the ruling replaces, which is the only mechanical statement of contradiction
there is, since no verb can read the prose and judge which row a ruling overturns. The URL is checked
against the issue the marker binds, in the read, because a ruling recorded on another issue rules
nothing here and admitting one would let a single comment unlock every decision on the board.

The marker's subject widened because a ruling that reaches no gate is prose: `review criteria` folds
every standing one into the set a reviewer grades, and `lane prove` reads a verdict written before
the newest ruling as no longer current. **The audience flip widened with it, to every type but
`type:epic`**.
The marker is what `decision rule` proves before it flips the issue from `ready-for:human` to
`ready-for:agent` — that ordering is the point, since a flip written ahead of a proven marker leaves
an issue reading pickable with no recorded ruling behind it — and the proven marker earns the flip
without compelling it: a ruled issue whose body carries no readable `### Acceptance criteria` block
keeps its marker and stays on `ready-for:human`, because `ready-for:agent` promises a builder can
grade the issue cold. On a `type:epic` the marker lands and both `ready-for:` labels are left exactly
as they were found, because an epic's agent audience is `check-epic-plan`'s flip alone.

`fabrika decision rule` is the only writer, and it runs in this order: derive the digest over the
issue body itself, post the marker, read it back, and only then flip the audience, reporting the
labels from a re-read rather than asserting them. Exactly one flag names the ruling: `--cites <url>`
when it is already a comment on the issue, or `--authorization <file>` when it was given in
conversation. That file is posted verbatim as a dated comment first and the marker cites it, the
same shape as `grill rule`, so a ruling already made costs no comment to type. The answer is
`{"answer":"ruled","issue":n,"digest":"…","ruling":"…","supersedes":k|null,"by":"…","at":"…","comment":n,"audience":"ready-for:agent"|null,"observed":[…]}`.
`audience` is null wherever no flip was written — an epic, and an issue whose body has no readable
criteria block — and `observed` then lists the labels as they were found.

`fabrika decision ruling` is the reader. It answers
`{"answer":"ruling","issue":n,"state":"current|stale|absent","by":…,"markerDigest":…,"derivedDigest":"…","ruling":…,"at":…,"comment":…,"audience":…,"disregarded":n,"unauthorized":n}`,
and all three states exit `0`, because a missing ruling is the answer rather than a refusal. The
state is the newest marker's; `review criteria` is what prints every standing marker folded with the
body criteria. An off-roster author's marker is counted in `unauthorized` and never stands, and a
drifted one is counted in `disregarded` rather than dropped.

### `pitch-ruling`

A parentless feature that a founder ruling names by number needs no pitch. This format is the comment
triage posts on that feature to say where the ruling is. It carries the feature the comment is
posted on and the comment the ruling is written in, on that feature or on another issue; the shape
is in the owner module.

The comment is a pointer and carries no authority: anyone who can comment can post it, so its author
and its agent stamp are not read. `guard pitch-guard check` reads it and then verifies the ruling it
links, and [the guard's contract](guard-contract.md#pitch-guard-check) says what that ruling has to
be. A comment that links the ruling in free prose reads `Absent`, so the guard sees no pointer and
the feature still owes its pitch. One that reaches for the key and misses reads `Malformed`, and the
guard names the drift in that feature's failure line.

### `routed-elsewhere`

This is a gate saying, at one head, that this PR owes it no verdict. `review-ui` writes it, and both
gates that compute a required set read it — `ship gate` and `lane prove`, which must agree or a
lane that ships clean never leaves `review`. The two readings it reconciles: `ship scope` raises the
`ui` class from a path test that cannot see whether pixels moved, while `review-ui` cannot produce a
verdict where `render` refuses zero surfaces and `post` refuses to compose without a capture set —
the namespace was unfillable and `ship gate` blocks on absence. The record is the missing answer: a
gate that owes no verdict says so in bytes, rather than leaving an absence two other gates have to
guess about.

It carries no polarity, and that is the whole safety story. A PASS says a gate looked and found
nothing wrong; this says the gate's subject is not in the diff at all. Fold them and "I judged
nothing" ships as "I judged it and it passed" — so these are separate bytes under a key of their
own, `verdict-marker` reads them as `Absent`, and this reader is `Absent` on every verdict marker.
The head binding does the rest: a route is voided by any push, so the next tree is attested afresh
rather than inheriting a judgement formed over a diff nobody has read since.

### `lane-record`

This is a lane's history made public. A lane's ledger lives in the driving machine's gitignored
`.fabrika/lanes/`, so a lane driven on another machine is invisible to everyone else; when a lane
reaches a terminal state, the driver's `lane record` posts one of these to the lane's issue, and the
table sync reads it back to fill the project's Spent $, Asks and Origin fields. The two sides never
meet, and one of them is on another machine, so the bytes are the whole agreement. The first line
keys the record by the terminal it records, which is how a re-run of the driver's terminal step
answers "already posted" instead of stacking a second record. Two rows restate derived facts — the
asks are the parks routed to the founder, and the wall-clock is the span between its own two
instants — and the reader holds each to its source, so a record whose rows disagree is `Malformed`
rather than a record carrying two numbers for one fact.

## Adding a format

A new format is one sibling schema module plus one registry row — never a branch inside a verb, and
never a paragraph in a skill body. The row carries the owner module path, the producers and the
consumers, so **the table above is generated from the registry, never typed here**:
`fabrika wire index --write` renders it. Each format also carries one paragraph of protocol
narrative under a level-3 heading whose text is the format's key in backticks — that is the half the
row cannot hold, and the only half of this page written by hand.

`fabrika wire index` (no flag) is the check, and it runs in CI on a change to either side. It reds
on three things: a registered format with no narrative section here, a section here naming no
registered format, and a generated region that is not what the registry renders today. It refuses
as zero scope, never a vacuous pass, on an empty registry, an empty doc, a doc with no generated
region, or a doc with no format sections. Hand edits
inside the generated markers are overwritten by the generator and red in CI in the meantime. The
interface and totality law the module meets are typed in
[`wire/format.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/format.ts): every read is total over
`Found` / `Absent` / `Malformed`, so a drifted artifact never reads back as an empty one.

The ordered recipe — minting the module, registering the row, writing the narrative and proving the
format reads back — lives in the extension how-to:
[`guide/extend-the-wire-registry.md`](../guide/extend-the-wire-registry.md).
