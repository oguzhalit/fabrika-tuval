# fabrika CLI interface convention

The discipline every fabrika verb owes its caller: what `--help` discloses, what stdout and stderr
carry, which exit codes mean what, when a verb refuses to answer, how a verb is invoked, and what
it may call. Verb implementers build against this page and reviewers hold verbs to it.

Every rule states the failure it prevents. This page was split from one that also held the
contract-spec format; that second subject is now its own reference:
[the contract-spec format](contract-spec-format.md).

The two premises behind all six rules: fabrika pushes deterministic work maximally into CLI verbs
and keeps judgment in the thin skill wrapper, and an authoring session derives which verbs its skill
needs and writes the spec the CLI implements — that spec's format is
[contract-spec-format.md](contract-spec-format.md).

Six rules follow. Each states what a verb owes its caller, and the failure that follows from
skipping it.

## 1. `--help` is the interface — an agent discovers a verb at runtime, never by reading its source

Runtime discoverability is first-class: an agent that has to read a verb's source to call it is
reading text nothing keeps true. Root help lists every group with a purpose; per-verb help documents
subcommands and exit codes inline.

- Every verb, every subcommand, and every flag carries a description. A flag with no description is
  an undocumented input.
- **Two audiences read a verb's help, so a verb declares two descriptions, not one.** The parent
  group's `SUBCOMMANDS` list is scanned by a human choosing a verb; the verb's own `DESCRIPTION`
  block is read by whoever is about to call it. They want opposite things, and one string cannot be
  both:
  - the **short** description (`Command.withShortDescription`) is the list row — **one sentence**
    saying what the verb answers, no output shape, no exit codes, no example. The renderer neither
    wraps nor truncates it, so it must fit one terminal line beside the padded name column; the
    budget and the checks are `packages/fabrika-cli/src/short-description.ts`, asserted for every
    registered leaf by `short-description.unit.test.ts`.
  - the **long** description (`Command.withDescription`) is the caller-facing block below, shaped
    by [leaf help size and shape](#leaf-help-size-and-shape); derivation stays in the contract.

  Reusing the long form as the list row is the defect this split fixes: a group whose verbs each
  contributed a thousand-character unwrapped row emitted a list no reader could parse.
  `withShortDescription` **adds** a field
  and the renderer falls back to `description` when it is absent, so nothing is truncated and the
  contract below is untouched.
- `--help` states, for the verb: what it answers, its output **shape** (rule 2), its exit codes
  (rule 3), and at least one example (rule 5). The long description carries the first three; the
  example goes through `Command.withExamples`, never as prose inside the description, as
  [leaf help size and shape](#leaf-help-size-and-shape) requires. The "one sentence" rule above
  governs the list row, not this block, and the two stop contradicting each other once they are
  separate strings.
- The index of verbs is **derived from the registry**, never hand-maintained: it reads name +
  description off the same `Command` objects the router dispatches on, so a new verb appears
  automatically and a verb shipped without a description is mechanically detectable. A parallel
  hand-written list rots; that is the defect the derived index replaced.
- **A `--help` that resolves is proof the path exists — up to the last node that takes subcommands.**
  `fabrika <unknown> …` is refused before the CLI runner sees it: the reason on stderr, nothing on
  stdout, exit `1`. That holds at the group level and inside a group, with or without `--help`, and
  however many invalid tokens follow. It has to be a fabrika-side guard because the runner answers
  the probe otherwise — `effect`'s `Command.runWith` processes action flags before it inspects parse
  errors, and `--help` is an action flag, so it printed the deepest valid prefix's help and exited
  `0` while discarding the whole invalid tail.
- **An operand a leaf verb never declared is refused too**, at the argument layer rather than the
  path layer. Every leaf declares a hidden trailing catch-all, so the parser hands the verb whatever
  its own arguments left, and the verb refuses on stderr with exit `1` (rule 3's usage-error code)
  instead of binding none of them and answering anyway. `fabrika adr next bogus` refuses;
  `fabrika adr resolve 0164 0023` still absorbs both ids, because a variadic argument consumes its
  operands before the catch-all sees them.
- **The residual caveat: a global flag placed *before* the group name ends the path guard's walk.**
  `fabrika --log-level info no-such-group --help` exits `0` with root help even though
  `no-such-group` is not registered. The walk stops at the first `-`-prefixed token because a later
  bare token may be that flag's value (`--log-level debug`), and reading a value as a subcommand would refuse a valid
  invocation — a miss is the fail-safe direction for a guard whose only output is a refusal. This
  stays a documented residual rather than a code fix: telling a flag's value from a subcommand needs
  the parser's own per-flag arity, which the published `effect` types do not expose, so a
  fabrika-side fix would carry a hand-maintained list of which global flags take a value — the
  parallel-list rot this same rule forbids for the verb index.

## 2. Results by value on stdout; the shape is documented, not guessed

Stdout and stderr are two channels because a caller reads one of them by machine. A tool that mixes
progress into the answer forces every caller to filter, and every filter is a place the contract
drifts.

- **Stdout is the answer. Everything else is stderr.** Progress, warnings, refusal reasons and scope
  statements are diagnostics.
- Every verb declares its answer channel as exactly one of:
  - **machine** — stdout is parsed, split, or fed to another command. Nothing but the answer lands
    there, and the shape is fixed (a JSON object with named keys, or a line grammar).
  - **prose** — stdout is a human-readable verdict the caller greps for a state word.
- `--help` shows the caller's answer shape as bytes, in full when it fits the
  [leaf help budget](#leaf-help-size-and-shape). A shape too long for that budget is elided with
  `…` in help, and the contract or wire format that help's pointer line names carries the full
  bytes. Contracts add the
  implementation requirements under [command documentation ownership](#command-documentation-ownership).
  Prose describing a shape is not a shape.
- **The positive answer is a positive token, never an absence.** A verb whose "nothing found" answer
  is empty stdout is byte-identical to a verb that never ran. Print a state word.

### Command documentation ownership

Each document serves a distinct reader:

- **Runtime help** owns calling the command: invocation, inputs, defaults, the answer shape, exit
  meanings and a runnable example. A shape past the leaf help budget is elided in help and carried
  in full by the contract or wire format help points to. The registry supplies discovery through group help.
- **Contracts** own implementing the command: how values are derived, mutation ordering, authority
  checks, scope, failure conditions and examples that exercise those requirements. A shipped
  command's contract may point to its help for caller facts; a new command specifies them in the
  contract until help exists. The [contract-spec format](contract-spec-format.md) defines this split.
- **Skills** own acting on the result. Keep the tokens and refusal meanings a step needs to choose
  its next action; use a help or section pointer for details the step does not consume.
- **Package references** orient readers to groups and their help or contracts. They carry useful
  overviews and unique examples, without another output grammar, state list or exit-code table.
- **Source comments** explain local implementation constraints. A public command specification
  belongs behind a help or contract pointer. Tool pragmas and local invariants stay at their line.

When behavior changes, update each affected owner in the implementation PR. Keep an example only
when it demonstrates a requirement or use the other examples do not. A caller fact needed in both
help and a skill's routing step earns that overlap through its use; there is no requirement to copy
every fact into both, or to edit a reference row and source comment for every command change.

#### Leaf help size and shape

A leaf verb's `Command.withDescription` string is a pointer an agent reads on every `--help`, so it
holds the caller facts and nothing else:

- **One-line summary first.** Line one says what the verb does and what it prints on stdout, as one
  sentence ending in a full stop.
- **An answer shape that does not fit is elided, not dropped.** When the full stdout bytes would push
  a line past 98 characters or the description past its budget, help shows the answer token or the
  leading keys and elides the rest with `…`, as in `{"answer":"ruled",…}`. The full bytes live in
  the section the pointer line names: the verb's contract section, or the wire format it links.
- **Flag detail on the flag.** Each flag's meaning, default and constraints go on its own
  `Flag.withDescription`, and each argument's on `Argument.withDescription`. The renderer prints
  them in the `FLAGS` and `ARGUMENTS` tables, so the description does not repeat them.
- **One line per exit.** Each exit code the verb seats a proven outcome on gets one line,
  `  <code>: <meaning>`, in ascending order. The meaning is a few words; a code with several causes
  names the class and leaves the causes to the contract. `0` and `1` need no line, because
  [§3](#3-the-exit-status-is-the-answer-empty-stdout-never-is) fixes them for every verb.
- **Examples through `Command.withExamples`.** A runnable example is an `Example` entry, never
  `Example:` prose inside the description.
- **Derivation in the contract.** How a value is derived, why a check exists and what order
  mutations run in belong in the verb's contract. Help keeps at most one pointer line to it, as the
  description's last line.

The whole description is at most **600 characters**, and every line at most 98 characters of text
after its two-space indent. Both numbers start from the renderer, the way
[`short-description.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/short-description.ts) derives its row
budget. `formatHelpDocImpl` in `effect@4.0.0-rc.112`'s `src/unstable/cli/CliOutput.ts` prints the
block as `  ${doc.description}`, so at the 100-column terminal `short-description.ts` also assumes,
a line holds 98 characters. The total is one 98-character summary plus twelve lines averaging 41
characters with their newlines: 98 + 12 × 41 = 590, rounded up to 600. Twelve lines are sized
off `review-ui render`, which seats nine exit codes past `0` and `1` (7, 10 to 16, and 19):
nine exit lines, one pointer line and two to spare.

The mechanical checks are [`leaf-help.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/leaf-help.ts), and
`leaf-help.unit.test.ts` holds every registered leaf to them. Every registered leaf verb passes the
rule. A verb that breaks it is admitted only through a `leaf-help-baseline.json` in its group, and
no group carries one, so a new wall fails the unit suite.

The exit lines carry their own two-space indent, and that choice is also the renderer's. The pinned
`formatHelpDocImpl` indents only the description's first line: an embedded `\n` passes through
untouched, so a bare newline starts the next line at column zero, flush with the `DESCRIPTION`
heading. Writing `\n  ` before each exit line puts it under the summary. Rendered through the pinned
formatter, a bare `\n` gives the first block and `\n  ` the second:

```text
DESCRIPTION
  Summary line.
3: not found
11: read failed, UNKNOWN
```

```text
DESCRIPTION
  Summary line.
  3: not found
  11: read failed, UNKNOWN
```

A compliant description for `build eligible`, 302 characters, with its example on
`Command.withExamples([{command: "fabrika build eligible 4312"}])`:

```text
Prints {"answer":"eligible","number":n,"parent":n|null} when one issue's dependency gate is open.
  7: the issue is absent or closed
  11: a read failed and nothing was proven open (UNKNOWN)
  16: blocked; every open edge is named on stderr
  Derivation: the build skill's contract.md, "build eligible"
```

## 3. The exit status is the answer; empty stdout never is

The whole taxonomy rests on one separation: a verdict a verb proved must never share a code with a
failure to invoke it, or a caller reading `$?` cannot tell them apart.

- **`0` means "I produced the answer on stdout". Any non-zero means "I could not produce one"** —
  UNKNOWN, never the permissive reading. A caller reads the status before the bytes.
- **The whole answer reaches the caller, or the verb has not answered.** A write to stdout is
  asynchronous when stdout is a pipe — and `x=$(fabrika …)` is a pipe — so `process.exit` on the line
  after the write discards whatever is still queued, silently and on exit `0`. Every group adapter
  emits through the one shared helper,
  [`emit.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/emit.ts), which exits from the write callback
  instead; a group that hand-rolls its own truncates its long answers again.
- **A verdict a verb proved must never share an exit code with a failure to invoke.** `1` is what
  the Effect CLI returns for a usage error and what a failed module load returns; `127` is the
  shell's missing-binary code. A proven verdict seated on either is unreadable as proof, because
  `[ $? -ne 0 ]` then reads "never ran" as "ran and proved it". So:

  | Code | Reserved for |
  |---|---|
  | `0` | the answer was produced on stdout |
  | `1` | usage error, or the verb failed to run |
  | `2` | **never allocated** — the harness's block code on `PreToolUse` |
  | `126` | no implementation could be resolved — the binary was found, the verbs were not |
  | `127` | the verb never ran at all (unresolved binary) |
  | `3`+ | the verb's own proven outcomes, each enumerated in `--help` |

  `126` is the seat between the two invocation failures: `127` is the shell reporting that nothing
  ran, `1` is a verb reporting that it ran and the caller asked wrongly, and between them sits the
  case where `fabrika` itself started but could not reach a working set of verbs — seating that on
  `1` would make it indistinguishable from a typo in a flag. `126` is the shell's own *found but not
  executable*, so the two invocation failures read as one band.
- **`2` is allocated by nothing, in any group, and that is a hard rule rather than a free slot.** On
  a `PreToolUse` hook, exit `2` is the *one* code the harness reads as "block the tool call", so an
  exit code seated there denies a tool call as a side effect of its status, whatever the verb meant
  — the inverse of the fail-open polarity ruled for a hook whose verb cannot run: a verb that never
  ran produced no evidence, so it may never deny. The full harness contract, and why it is
  `PreToolUse`-only, is in
  [`hook-surface.md`](hook-surface.md#the-harness-exit-code-contract--exit-2-blocks-and-only-on-pretooluse).
  The rule is checked as data: `packages/fabrika-cli/src/exit-code-alignment.unit.test.ts` reds if
  any group's table allocates it.
- **The `3`+ band is scoped to the verb group that seats it. A code above the reserved band means one
  thing *within* its group and carries no cross-group uniqueness obligation.** Two shipped shapes are
  both correct, and a group picks by whether its verbs share refusal meanings:

  - **Per verb, no shared table** — the `3`+ row above read literally. Permitted; today shipped
    nowhere, which is what the shape costs when a group's verbs *do* share refusal meanings.
  - **Per group, one shared table** — every registered group ships a `<group>/codes.ts` that every
    verb in the group allocates from, so a code means one thing
    across the group whichever verb produced it. That is a **tightening** a group chooses, not a
    further obligation this rule imposes.

  Neither shape reaches across a group boundary:
  [`triage/codes.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/triage/codes.ts) seats `12` as *the issue is
  human-filed*; [`review/codes.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/codes.ts) seats `12` as
  *the live head moved past the inspected `--sha`*. Those are two namespaces, not one collision.

- **The code-for-code alignment to the shared registry is a deliberate, bounded courtesy — not a
  repo-wide namespace.** It began with `report`, `triage` and `review`, which one caller commonly
  drives in a single sweep, and it now covers every group `ALIGNED_GROUPS` lists in
  [`exit-code-alignment.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/exit-code-alignment.ts). The shared
  seats are the constants the shared registry exports, one meaning each, and a group claims only
  the seats whose meaning it shares. Every aligning group *imports* the
  constants from the shared registry (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/exit-codes.ts`) rather than
  restating numerals, so a drift there is unrepresentable rather than merely detectable. The module
  mechanizes exactly that scope and no more: it checks each aligning group against the **base** and
  never pairwise against a sibling. Above the shared overlap each group's private band is its own —
  `review`'s `12`–`21` and `triage`'s `12`–`27` are not required to clear each other, and do not.

  [`wire/codes.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/codes.ts) and
  [`config/codes.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/config/codes.ts) are the two shipped
  counter-examples: each aligns to nothing and is *registered* in `UNALIGNED_GROUPS` with its
  reason, so the exemption carries information instead of reading as an oversight. `wire`
  legitimately reuses numerals that other groups seat on different meanings — read its table there
  rather than here. Under a cross-group clearance
  rule `wire` would be the largest violation in the package; it is not a violation at all.

- **One condition would turn a cross-group reuse into a defect: a reader that resolves an exit code
  without knowing which group produced it.** None exists today, and the interface is what keeps it
  that way. Every invocation names its group (`fabrika <group> <verb> …`, rule 5); each `--help`
  enumerates only the codes that verb can reach; and the runtime taxonomy verb is per group —
  `fabrika triage codes` prints `TRIAGE_EXIT_TABLE`, `fabrika wire codes` prints `WIRE_EXIT_TABLE`,
  with no cross-group table and no shared lookup. Add such a reader — a dispatcher, a shared decoder,
  a wrapper that maps a numeral to a meaning before it knows the group — and cross-group clearance
  becomes a real obligation to encode. Until then, re-seating a shipped code to clear a sibling buys
  nothing and breaks that group's own symmetry.
- A verb whose result crosses a pipe keeps its exit code binary (`0` / non-zero) and puts the
  discriminator in a stdout state word: a meaningful code does not survive `xargs`.

## 4. Fail closed on missing scope or state

A gate that scanned nothing has judged nothing, and the two are indistinguishable in its output
unless it refuses.

- A verb that **judges** states the scope its verdict rests on, on its own answer channel, and
  **reds on zero scope**. "I scanned nothing and found no violations" is a pass a guard must never
  emit.
- A verb that only **supplies** an input decides, once and in its header, whether an empty result is
  a fact or a failed read — and says which. An empty team roster is a fact; an empty changed-file
  list on a pull request is a failed read.
- Assert on the positive shape required, never on the absence of an imagined failure. A missing
  field read as `undefined` is not zero, and `undefined === 0` is `false` — that comparison is how a
  guard once vouched for a corpus it never scanned.

## 5. Every documented invocation is a plain literal command string

An agent executes a command; it never sources one, because a sourced script rewrites the caller's
own shell out from under it. And a variable-rooted invocation is refused outright:

The harness's isolation verifier is a **syntactic check on the command string**: it does not consult
process env and does not touch the filesystem — `$USER` and `$PWD` are refused while genuinely set,
a symlink to a nonexistent target runs and fails with an ordinary `127`, and `$HOME` appears to be
special-cased. No env-injection mechanism
of any kind can make a variable-rooted invocation usable at an agent's top-level command.

- A fabrika verb is invoked as a plain literal command string — no `$VAR`, no `${VAR:-default}`, no
  command substitution, no `source`. The one thing that is not a `$VAR` here is a name a skill
  declares in its own `arguments:` frontmatter: the harness substitutes it into the skill body
  textually before the agent reads it, so the string the verifier checks still holds a literal
  ([skill-conventions §4](skill-conventions.md#4-the-invocation-surface-is-a-plain-literal)). That
  carve-out reaches skill bodies only — a hook command has no caller argument to bind and stays
  literal end to end.
- **The literal is `fabrika`.** Every fence in every fabrika skill writes
  `fabrika <group> <verb> …` and nothing else. The command and the package are deliberately
  **different names** — `fabrika` is the `bin` *key* of the CLI package, which keeps its own name on
  the registry and its own directory in the repo. [Delivery](#delivery--one-name-two-installs)
  below is how the command comes to resolve.
- **Examples in `--help` and in a contract spec are held to the same rule.** An example an agent
  cannot paste verbatim is not an example.
- **A verb whose body arrives on stdin never grows a path-valued body flag**, whatever command-size
  pressure the caller reports. The caller stages the body under its group's scratch path and
  redirects a literal `< <path>` into the verb — the route
  [skill-conventions §4](skill-conventions.md#a-body-too-large-for-one-command-is-staged-never-trimmed)
  fixes — so the bytes still arrive on stdin and the verb reads no path it could post.
- A verb never requires an env var to *locate* itself. Configuration may still arrive by env
  (a session id, a target repo), and each such variable is named in `--help` with its default and
  what happens when it is unset.

<a id="delivery--one-name-two-installs"></a>
### Delivery — one name, two installs, both of them real

`fabrika` is delivered as a **global install** of the CLI package. On startup the binary finds the
**repo root** above the working directory, asks Node's own resolver what copy that root installed,
and hands the invocation to it — the shape turbo ships, reimplemented in fabrika's own TypeScript.
The property that buys is a **repo-pinned version**: a repo carrying the package in its
`devDependencies` gets that version from a bare fence, whatever each machine's global happens to be.

Both installs are real installed packages, and neither is chosen by testing whether a file exists
and guessing that it will run. Tiers that can only be right or loudly absent are fine; tiers that
can be quietly wrong are the defect.

The branch that makes that concrete is the degenerate one. **A repo root that pins the package but
has not installed it, or whose install is corrupt, runs the global and says so loudly** — naming the
global's version beside the version the root manifest declared, silenceable with
`FABRIKA_GLOBAL_WARNING_DISABLED`. It is not an error: the worst outcome is that the global runs.
**No repo root at all is the one silent branch**, deliberately, so a global-only invocation stays
quiet. Separating those two is the whole point — collapsing them is what makes a delegation quietly
wrong.

Three environment variables belong to the delivery layer rather than to any verb, and none of them
locates the binary, so none weakens rule 5: `FABRIKA_DEBUG` prints one stderr line naming which copy
served the invocation; `FABRIKA_GLOBAL_WARNING_DISABLED` silences the degenerate branch's warning;
`FABRIKA_SKIP_INFER` is the recursion guard for a caller that cannot alter argv. The guard the CLI
itself uses on the child is the **`--skip-infer` flag**, stripped before any verb sees it, and the
child is additionally handed the user's original directory as `FABRIKA_INVOCATION_DIR` because its
own cwd is set to the repo root.

## 6. fabrika calls nothing outside fabrika

Duplication keeps the tool fabrika replaces deletable; a call is a tether that keeps it alive.

**No fabrika skill and no fabrika verb invokes a predecessor tool, or anything else outside the
plugin and its verb package.** Every deterministic step a skill needs is implemented in fabrika's
own verb package. Where a predecessor already solved the same problem, read its source at a pinned
commit to learn the semantics and the scars, then implement fabrika's own.

Two consequences:

- **A relay is not an exception.** Wrapper verbs whose only job is passing an upstream answer
  through rebuild the predecessor by accretion — the outcome the rule exists to prevent.
- **Not every predecessor call becomes a fabrika verb; some become nothing.** Where the thing being
  computed is already *enforced* elsewhere — a CI gate, a merge check — fabrika does not compute a
  second answer to it. Ask whether the skill needs the answer, or only needs to expect it.

An authoring brief's "assumable verbs" field is therefore a list of **prior art to read**, not a
list of things to call.

## Enforcement

Per-verb tests check behavior. The shared data checks
`exit-code-alignment.unit.test.ts`, `short-description.unit.test.ts` and `leaf-help.unit.test.ts`
check code allocation, registered descriptions and long description size and shape. They do not prove every rule on this page; reviewers check the remaining
interface requirements against the verb and its contract.
