# fabrika contract-spec format

A **contract spec** is what an authoring session emits per skill: the verbs that skill needs, fully
specified. It is the deliverable of the derivation an authoring session owes: the session works out
which deterministic work belongs in the CLI and writes the contract the CLI implements, and that
document is the input a `builder` shell running the `build` skill builds from.

This page is the reference for that document's format: its required sections, the completeness test
it must clear, and a worked example. The runtime discipline every verb the spec describes owes its
caller is the sibling page's subject: [the CLI interface convention](interface-convention.md).

**Where it lands.** One `contract.md` beside the skill it serves —
`claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/<skill>/contract.md` — landing in the same pull request as the
`SKILL.md` the session authored. The implementing pull request links back to it.

**The bar it must clear.** A fresh `builder` implements every verb in the spec without
reading the authoring transcript, without asking the session a question, and without opening a
legacy script.

**What it is at runtime.** The authoring spec is `contract.md`'s primary role; runtime lookup is
not a role it carries. A running shell whose question has one addressable answer — an exit-code
row, a grammar table, a terminal vocabulary, one section — gets it from a CLI verb
(`fabrika wire doc-section --heading <x> < <skill-base>/contract.md`, or a dedicated lookup verb
like `fabrika triage codes`), never by opening the whole contract. Only a judgment-shaped pass —
authoring a skill, reviewing one, resolving an ambiguity the verbs cannot address — opens the file,
and even then section-at-a-time. A running shell that opens a whole contract to answer one
addressable question spends its context on text no decision needed, and the answer it reaches is
one nothing checked; the pointer-sizing side of the same split is
[skill-conventions §2](skill-conventions.md).

## Required sections

A spec has a header and one block per verb.

**Header** — the skill it serves and the date. Nothing else.

**Verb inventory** — one row per verb: name, one-line purpose, and the split test that put it here
(what makes this deterministic rather than judgment the wrapper keeps). A verb whose row cannot state
that test belongs in the skill, not the CLI.

**Per verb, in this order:**

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| Invocation | the literal command string, with subcommands. [Rule 5](interface-convention.md#5-every-documented-invocation-is-a-plain-literal-command-string) applies. |
| Inputs | validation and interactions between inputs; for a new verb, also specify each flag's type, requiredness, default and help meaning. For shipped caller facts, a per-verb help pointer suffices. |
| Output | derivation of values, ordering, completeness and empty-answer requirements. Point to shipped help for the caller's channel and grammar; specify them here for a new verb. |
| Exit status | the conditions that produce each outcome, obeying [rule 3](interface-convention.md#3-the-exit-status-is-the-answer-empty-stdout-never-is); use shipped help for code meanings already stated there. |
| Errors | one row per named failure: message text, stream, exit code, and whether it is a refusal (fail-closed) or a usage error. |
| Scope | for a judging verb: what it scans, and what zero scope does. |
| Examples | literal invocations with expected stdout that demonstrate implementation requirements or distinct cases beyond the help example. For a new verb, include its caller example here too. |
| Grounding | the incidents, rulings, or ADRs the behavior encodes — one line each. |

## Completeness test

A spec is complete when all eight hold across the spec and its explicitly named per-verb help.
For a new verb, the spec supplies the caller facts until that help exists. Once shipped, replace
repeated caller facts with the help pointer; keep the requirements an implementer cannot read there.

1. Every flag has a type and, if optional, a default.
2. Every stdout shape is shown by an example, not only described.
3. Every non-zero exit code is enumerated with the condition that produces it.
4. Every error names its message, its stream, and its code.
5. Every judging verb states its scope and its zero-scope behavior.
6. Implementation requirements live in the spec. Caller facts may resolve through shipped help;
   a legacy script, another skill's prose or the authoring session supplies neither.
7. **Every value an example prints is derivable from the spec.** A verb that emits a computed value
   specifies the computation — every input to it, down to the tie-break and the rounding — or prints
   no example value. Where the value also depends on data outside the spec, the example names data a
   reader can hold fixed, such as a committed fixture, rather than a corpus that moves under it.
8. **Every outcome the verb can reach has a code.** Walk the verb's *states* and check each one names
   a code.

Checks 1–6 are all *presence* tests, and a spec can pass every one of them while leaving its core
uninvented — that is check 7's finding: an example that *looks* verifiable and is not is worse than
no example, because a reader treats the number as a contract. Check 8 runs check 3 backwards — 3
walks the codes and asks what produces each, so it only sees what the spec already wrote down, and a
state the spec never mentioned is invisible to it. An unmentioned reachable state lands on `1`,
which [rule 3](interface-convention.md#3-the-exit-status-is-the-answer-empty-stdout-never-is)
reserves for a failure to invoke, so the spec's silence hands the caller a **proven** refusal it
cannot tell from a broken binary — the verdict-versus-invocation collision. Checks 7 and 8 are the
**outcome-completeness** pair: 7 that the spec derives every value it prints, 8 that it names every
outcome it can reach.

## Worked example

Illustration only. `decisions next-id` is an invented verb: fabrika has no `decisions` group, and
the shipped id allocator is `fabrika adr next`, whose contract is its own and differs from this one. It is here to show a complete block at the
level of detail the completeness test demands.

---

**Verb:** `decisions next-id` — the next unused ADR number.
**Split test:** deterministic. Scan filenames, take the max, add one. No judgment.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika decisions next-id [--dir <path>]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--dir` | string | no | `.decisions` | the directory of `NNNN-slug.md` decision records to scan |

**Output** — machine channel. Parse each valid filename's four decimal digits, take the maximum,
add one and pad to four digits. Emit that id followed by a newline. File contents and directory
iteration order do not affect the result. There is no empty answer. An id above `9999` is refused.
On success, stderr reports `decisions: scanned <dir>, <count> decision records`.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | the id was produced on stdout |
| `1` | usage error, such as an unknown flag or a missing `--dir` value |
| `3` | the directory was read and held zero candidate files |
| `4` | a candidate filename does not satisfy the record grammar |
| `5` | the directory or an entry's file type could not be read |
| `6` | the greatest parsed id is `9999`, so no four-digit successor exists |

Every refusal leaves stdout empty. Filesystem errors take precedence over content judgments;
malformed names take precedence over id derivation. If several names are malformed, report the
lexicographically first name by Unicode code point.

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `decisions: unknown flag: <flag>` | 1 | usage error |
| `decisions: --dir requires a value` | 1 | usage error |
| `decisions: unexpected operand: <value>` | 1 | usage error |
| `decisions: cannot read <path>: <reason>` | 5 | refusal; reason is the filesystem error code |
| `decisions: scanned <dir>, 0 decision records — refusing to answer` | 3 | refusal |
| `decisions: <dir> holds a record with an unparseable id: <name>` | 4 | refusal |
| `decisions: <dir> has no four-digit id after 9999` | 6 | refusal |

**Scope** — regular files immediately inside `--dir` whose names end in `.md`; no recursion or
symlink traversal. Each candidate must match `[0-9]{4}-[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*\.md` in full.
Other entries are ignored. A candidate such as `draft-choice.md` is malformed, not silently absent.
Zero candidates is a proven empty scan and refuses: this example assumes an existing decision
corpus, so answering `0001` could conceal a wrong directory. This supplies an id; it does not judge
the records' contents. The scope diagnostic belongs on stderr beside the machine answer.

**Examples**

Hold these input directories fixed. Every listed file is a readable regular file with empty
contents, every directory is readable, and no other entries exist. `example-missing` does not exist
and the filesystem reports `ENOENT` for it.

| Directory | Files |
|---|---|
| `example-decisions` | `0001-first.md`, `0232-second.md` |
| `example-empty` | none |
| `example-malformed` | `draft-choice.md` |
| `example-full` | `9999-last.md` |

```text
$ fabrika decisions next-id --dir example-decisions
0233
```

That invocation exits `0`; stdout is `0233` plus a newline and stderr is
`decisions: scanned example-decisions, 2 decision records` plus a newline. The maximum is 232,
so the successor is 233, regardless of enumeration order.

Each invocation below has empty stdout and the named stderr line plus a newline:

| Invocation | Exit | Stderr |
|---|---|---|
| `fabrika decisions next-id --dir example-empty` | 3 | `decisions: scanned example-empty, 0 decision records — refusing to answer` |
| `fabrika decisions next-id --dir example-malformed` | 4 | `decisions: example-malformed holds a record with an unparseable id: draft-choice.md` |
| `fabrika decisions next-id --dir example-missing` | 5 | `decisions: cannot read example-missing: ENOENT` |
| `fabrika decisions next-id --dir example-full` | 6 | `decisions: example-full has no four-digit id after 9999` |

**Grounding**

- Zero scope refuses rather than answering `0001`, because an empty scan cannot establish the
  next id in an existing corpus.
- Proven refusals use `3` and above; usage failures use `1`. An unreadable directory has its own
  code and is never evidence of an empty directory.
- Serialized authoring: concurrent id derivation races, so a caller that mints records in parallel
  pre-assigns ids rather than calling this verb twice.
