# fabrika hook surface

The reference for fabrika's Claude Code hook layer: **the surface** — where a fabrika hook is declared and how it invokes a verb — [**the hook verbs' derivations**](#the-hook-verbs-derivations) each hook verb's help points to, and **the record format** a grading pass writes its verdicts into.

## The surface

fabrika declares its Claude Code hooks in one file, [`../hooks.json`](../hooks.json), in the plugin directory. There is no dispatch script, no installed-copy path to resolve and no version marker gating the dispatch, and that is not an omission — it falls out of two rules stated elsewhere, so this section cites them instead of restating them:

- **A hook command is a plain literal `fabrika <group> <verb>` string** — no `$VAR`, no `${VAR:-default}`, no command substitution, no `source` ([`interface-convention.md`](interface-convention.md#5-every-documented-invocation-is-a-plain-literal-command-string) rule 5). An agent executes a command; it never sources one, because a sourced script can rewrite the caller's own shell out from under it.
- **A hook calls only verbs implemented in [`../../../packages/fabrika-cli/`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/)** — never another tool the plugin does not own ([`interface-convention.md`](interface-convention.md#6-fabrika-calls-nothing-outside-fabrika) rule 6).

The Codex usage hooks are a separate declaration, outside this surface: [`../../../packages/fabrika-cli/docs/codex-hooks.json`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/docs/codex-hooks.json), which a repo merges into its own `.codex/hooks.json` ([Codex guide](../guide/codex.md#enable-interactive-usage-collection)). This page covers the Claude Code hook layer, and the check behind the plain-literal rule reads only the plugin file and a repo's own `.claude/settings.json`, so that rule does not reach the Codex file. Its command carries a command substitution.

Which copy of the CLI serves the invocation is answered by the repo-root shim, not by the hook: [`../../../packages/fabrika-cli/docs/packaging.md`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/docs/packaging.md), *Which copy serves an invocation*. That is what deletes the wrapper / data-dir / pin apparatus a hand-rolled hook layer grows — every job those three did has a home somewhere else.

Both rules are checked as **data**, not by eye: [`../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/hook/declaration.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/hook/declaration.ts) reads `hooks.json` and reports every command that carries a shell construct, is not a plain `fabrika <group> <verb>` literal, or names something outside fabrika — and [`../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/hook/envelope.golden.test.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/hook/envelope.golden.test.ts) reds on a non-empty report, and on an empty surface: a declaration with zero hooks is never a pass, because a gate that scanned nothing has judged nothing.

### The declared hooks, and how they are proven

The plugin declares the envelope check, the CLI minimum check, the two Bash guards (worktree escape and stash) and the [Claude usage collector](claude-usage.md). An adopting repo may declare a worktree provider on its own, in
its `.claude/settings.json` — `fabrika hook worktree-create` on `WorktreeCreate` — for the reason
[below](#worktreecreate--a-provider-hook-left-undeclared): that event is safe where the toolchain is
guaranteed and unsafe where it is not, so it lives where the guarantee holds and never here. It may
declare `fabrika hook plugin-sync` on `SessionStart` for the reason
[below](#sessionstart-plugin-sync--a-checkout-move-left-to-the-repo) — that verb moves a checkout,
and which checkout is a fact only the adopting repo knows. Both
documents are read by the same
[`declaration.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/hook/declaration.ts) and judged against the same
two rules; what differs is which events each may carry.

`fabrika hook check` on `SessionStart` is this surface's proof — it reads the envelope the harness writes to a hook's stdin and answers whether it is one fabrika can act on ([`../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/hook/check-verb.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/hook/check-verb.ts)).

`fabrika hook cli-floor` on `SessionStart` warns when the running CLI is older than the minimum the plugin declares in [`../cli-floor.json`](../cli-floor.json). The skills ship with every commit and the CLI ships by release, so an adopter's pinned CLI can lack a verb or flag a skill calls. The warning goes out as `systemMessage` and names both versions and the upgrade command; a CLI at or above the minimum shows nothing. release-please writes the minimum in each fabrika-cli Release PR, and [`cli-floor.repo.test.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/hook/cli-floor.repo.test.ts) reds when it drifts from the package version. It does not dispatch anything, so it is not a version marker in the sense above. A CLI released before this verb existed refuses it as an unknown subcommand, which the session shows and then starts anyway.

Two fabrika hooks **decide** something, both on `PreToolUse`/`Bash`, and each denies one command shape.

`fabrika hook pre-bash` denies a Bash command whose leading `cd`/`pushd` resolves outside the linked worktree the command runs in, whatever follows that jump, and read through the wrappers that jump can be written inside — a subshell, a command substitution, a brace group, `VAR=value` prefixes — since each of those is the same act one keystroke away. It exists because the harness's own escape refusals read the *command text*, so a program that reaches git in a child process passes them and moves the shared checkout's HEAD — observed twice in the field. It arms only inside a linked worktree, since which tree an agent works in is the operator's call and only *leaving* an isolated one is judged.

`fabrika hook stash-guard` denies a Bash command that runs `git stash`, in any subcommand form and however it is addressed, when `git rev-parse --git-dir` and `--git-common-dir` differ in the command's `cwd` — that is, in a linked worktree. `refs/stash` lives in the common git dir, so every worktree of a clone shares one stash stack, and a pop can restore a sibling lane's files and drop its entry with no warning. `git -C "$WT" stash` is scoped and still shares the stack, which is why the refusal keys on the subcommand. It exists because this happened twice in the field before the guard did, once from a review shell and once between two build lanes, and a prose rule reaches only the shells whose skill carries it. Where the two dirs agree, the stash is let through.

The former `fabrika hook spawn` on `PreToolUse` was a model-allowlist guard. It is **retired** — verb and declaration both deleted — because which model a subagent runs on is a per-run human choice, and a hook that second-guesses it only blocks the choice the human already made.

A declared hook nobody ever runs is a false green, so the proof does not stop at the declaration. The test **runs the argv it reads out of the committed `hooks.json`** — never a literal in the test — against **captured** `SessionStart` and `PreToolUse` envelopes, with the two subagent-spawn captures pinned by shape, all committed at [`../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/hook/__fixtures__/`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/hook/__fixtures__/) with their capture method, date and harness version beside them in `PROVENANCE.md`. Capture the real runtime artifact before coding against it: a hand-authored envelope encodes what its author assumed, and the assertions then pin the assumption rather than the payload. Two properties are what make that a proof rather than a schema asserted against itself: the argv comes from the declaration, so a green test cannot be exercising a verb the surface does not name; and the fixtures are what Claude Code 2.1.226 really sent, so the shape assertions pin keys a doc-assumed envelope would have missed — `PreToolUse` carries `prompt_id`, `permission_mode` and `effort`, and the hand-authored spawn-guard envelope that preceded these captures knew about none of them.

The one thing this cannot do is notice the **harness** changing. No gate here executes it, so a stale fixture goes green; re-capture is the only refresh, and `PROVENANCE.md` says how.

<a id="the-events-fabrika-does-not-declare"></a>
### The events fabrika does not declare, and why

Five events were considered for task control and all five were refused for that purpose. `SubagentStop` is now declared for usage collection only; it still supplies no task verdict. Each entry below says what the event carries, why a fabrika verb cannot act on it, and — for the three non-worktree ones — what a payload would have had to carry instead, so a later reader can tell whether a newer build has fixed it.

Everything here is read out of the **installed Claude Code executable, build 2.1.233**, by two methods, named per claim so neither is mistaken for the other:

- **Registry read.** The build carries its own hook-event registry — one `summary` plus a `description` that names the input JSON's fields — the same table `/hooks` renders. Extracted with `strings` and quoted verbatim below.
- **Live capture.** Probe hooks wired in a throwaway git repository, each writing its stdin to a file. Absolute paths in the captures are elided; nothing else is edited.

The registry entries and the exit-code lines quoted on this page were re-read in build 2.1.288 and match. The live captures and the three `WorktreeRemove` teardown strings keep the build each one names. A newer build can change any row. The method above is the recheck.

#### `WorktreeCreate` — a provider hook, left undeclared

Registry entry, verbatim:

```
Create an isolated worktree for VCS-agnostic isolation
Input to command is JSON with name (suggested worktree slug).
Stdout should contain the absolute path to the created worktree directory.
Exit code 0 - worktree created successfully
Other exit codes - worktree creation failed
```

So it is **not a notification**. The harness expects the hook to create the worktree and echo its path, and it exists so worktree isolation can work under a non-git VCS. Captured live:

```json
{"session_id":"…","transcript_path":"…","cwd":"…","hook_event_name":"WorktreeCreate","name":"probe2"}
```

**The failure mode was reproduced rather than inferred.** In an ordinary git repository — one where `git worktree add` works — with a `WorktreeCreate` hook whose command exits non-zero, `claude --worktree <name>` printed

```
Error creating worktree: WorktreeCreate hook failed: false: no output
```

and the session never started. **There is no git fallback**: a configured hook preempts git wherever it is declared, so declaring this event means fabrika takes over worktree creation in every repo that installs the plugin, and a verb that fails breaks worktree isolation outright.

That failure mode is not survivable, and the reason is sharper than "it would be bad". [The ruled dispatch-failure policy](#the-dispatch-failure-policy-point) is fail-open, and on this event **fail-open has no form**. The harness reads every non-zero exit as a creation failure, including the two codes the convention reserves for *the verb never ran* — a bare `fabrika` exiting `127` on a machine with no install, and the cross-checkout refusal at `126`. It says so itself, in a build string that covers the hook not running at all:

```
WorktreeCreate hook failed: hook is configured but did not run (workspace not trusted, disableAllHooks set, or matcher mismatch)
```

A machine with no fabrika install would therefore lose `--worktree` entirely, which is the inverse of the fail-open ruling below. **Left undeclared on this surface, and that refusal is unchanged.**

> **The event may be declared elsewhere, and the distinction is the whole reason it can be.** Everything above binds a *plugin* declaration, which travels to every adopting repo — that is what makes the no-fail-open exposure unbounded. A repo's own `.claude/settings.json` travels nowhere, and a checkout of that repo without fabrika is already broken, so the same event carries a bounded cost there: it may declare `fabrika hook worktree-create` with a long timeout, which provisions a worktree the package manager's install would otherwise leave dep-less. Rule 5 binds that command exactly as it binds one here, and [`declaration.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/hook/declaration.ts) reads both documents — so the golden test asserts, per document, that no `Worktree*` event ever appears on **this** surface. That assertion is the refusal above, with teeth.

<a id="sessionstart-plugin-sync--a-checkout-move-left-to-the-repo"></a>
#### `SessionStart` / `plugin-sync` — a checkout move left to the repo

The event is declared here already, for `fabrika hook check`. What is left to the repo is the **verb**, and the distinction is the same one the `WorktreeCreate` note above draws: the surface is not the risk, the mutation is.

A `skills:` preload is not read live out of a plugin directory. Where a marketplace's source is a **directory**, the harness copies that tree into its own plugin cache under a name keyed by the commit the directory sat at, records that commit as the install's `gitCommitSha`, and renders every spawned shell's preload out of the copy. So the text an agent runs is only ever as current as the commit the source directory's primary worktree was checked out at when the harness last copied it — and a landed skill change is invisible to every shell spawned before that, silently, because preloaded text names no version and a shell has no way to tell it is running retired guidance.

`fabrika hook plugin-sync` closes the half a repository owns: it fast-forwards the source directory's primary worktree to `origin/<default>` at session start, so the step is the harness's rather than a person's to remember. It takes a fast-forward and nothing else, and it reports — never drives — the other half, which is the harness's own `autoUpdate` re-copy.

**It stays off this surface because it writes to a checkout.** A plugin declaration travels to every adopting repo, and which checkout a marketplace is registered against is a fact only the adopting repo knows; a plugin that moved a branch in every repo installing it would be making a mutation nobody asked for, in trees it cannot see. So the verb is fabrika's, portable, and names no repository, and the declaration is the repo's — exactly the split `WorktreeCreate` already uses. Rule 5 binds the command there as it binds one here, and [`declaration.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/hook/declaration.ts) reads both documents.

**Its failure is fail-open by construction.** `SessionStart` has no blocking code at all ([the harness exit-code contract](#the-harness-exit-code-contract)), so every refusal this verb makes shows its stderr and the session starts regardless — which is the polarity a verb that advances a checkout must have: a checkout it may not touch is an ordinary state, and stopping a session over one would be the inverse of the ruled behaviour.

#### `WorktreeRemove` — the teardown counterpart, also a provider, left undeclared

Registry entry, verbatim:

```
Remove a previously created worktree
Input to command is JSON with worktree_path (absolute path to worktree).
Exit code 0 - worktree removed successfully
Other exit codes - show stderr to user only
```

The payload is the base envelope plus one field, `worktree_path`. The same build's teardown path carries three strings, and the third is the load-bearing one:

```
Removed hook-based worktree at: 
WorktreeRemove hook did not remove worktree, kept at: 
No WorktreeRemove hook configured; falling back to git worktree remove for: 
```

`git worktree remove` is the **fallback for having no hook**. So declaring this event replaces git teardown in every adopting repo, and the harness then checks whether the path actually went away — an observe-only verb makes every managed worktree leak, in a state that reports nothing louder than a line on stderr. Nothing is bought for that: `worktree_path` names a directory, not a lane, an issue or a claim token, so there is no verdict a fabrika verb could reach from it. Left undeclared.

**UNKNOWN:** this event was not fired live. Its hook runs on the in-session worktree cleanup path; the `claude rm <id>` background-job path refused every hook-created worktree (`worktree has files but no repository to verify them against`) and, once the directory was removed by hand, removed the job without invoking the hook. Its payload is therefore a registry read and its fallback behaviour a strings read — read, not seen.

#### `TaskCompleted` — carries a task id, and none of its ids are fabrika's

Registry entry, verbatim:

```
When a task is being marked as completed
Input to command is JSON with task_id, task_subject, task_description, teammate_name, and team_name.
Exit code 0 - stdout/stderr not shown
Exit code 2 - show stderr to model and prevent task completion
Other exit codes - show stderr to user only
```

**It does carry a `task_id`**, so the reason this event cannot be judged from is not the obvious one — recorded here so nobody re-derives the wrong one. The real blocker is that every id in that payload lives in the harness's own teammate-task namespace: none of them is a forge issue or PR number, and none is a fabrika claim token, so no verb can map a completed task back onto the lane it belongs to.

**What a verb would have needed:** one field carrying the issue number or the claim token the lane was opened under — anything `fabrika build confirm` could be addressed to. A build that adds one makes this re-decidable.

A second obstacle stands behind the first even if that field arrives: the blocking code here is `2`, and fabrika allocates `2` nowhere ([the harness exit-code contract](#the-harness-exit-code-contract)). A verb with something to refuse would have no admissible way to say it.

#### `TeammateIdle` — names a teammate, names no lane

Registry entry, verbatim:

```
When a teammate is about to go idle
Input to command is JSON with teammate_name and team_name.
Exit code 0 - stdout/stderr not shown
Exit code 2 - show stderr to teammate and prevent idle (teammate continues working)
Other exit codes - show stderr to user only
```

`teammate_name` identifies the teammate perfectly well; what is missing is the same linkage `TaskCompleted` lacks. Neither field says what the teammate was idle *against* — no issue, no PR, no claim — so an idling teammate is not an event fabrika can attach a verdict to.

**What a verb would have needed:** the lane the teammate held, by issue number or claim token. As with `TaskCompleted`, the blocking code is `2`, which fabrika does not allocate.

#### `SubagentStop` — identifies the subagent, states no outcome

Captured live, which makes this the strongest of the three — seen rather than read:

```json
{"session_id":"…","transcript_path":"…","cwd":"…","prompt_id":"…","permission_mode":"auto",
 "agent_id":"aa2a9583f18c0b8fe","agent_type":"general-purpose","effort":{"level":"medium"},
 "hook_event_name":"SubagentStop","stop_hook_active":false,"agent_transcript_path":"…",
 "last_assistant_message":"PONG","background_tasks":[],"session_crons":[]}
```

It carries `agent_id` and `agent_type`, so the subagent is identified. What no field states is **whether it succeeded** — there is no status, no exit code, no terminal token as data. `last_assistant_message` is prose, and deciding a lane's outcome by pattern-matching prose is exactly the claim-a-tree-does-not-support failure the [`build`](../skills/build/SKILL.md) skill exists to refuse.

**What a verb would have needed:** an outcome field — a status, or the subagent's terminal token carried as data rather than embedded in its last message.

Until then the artifact is the only place an outcome can be read — the PR, the posted verdict, the claim marker — and fabrika's verbs already read it there, so the usage collector never derives a task outcome from this event.

<a id="the-harness-exit-code-contract"></a>
### The harness exit-code contract — exit `2` blocks, and only on `PreToolUse`

**On `PreToolUse`, exit `2` is the only blocking code; every other exit shows stderr and the tool call proceeds.** That is the harness's rule, not fabrika's, and it is the reason `2` is allocated by nothing in fabrika's exit tables ([`interface-convention.md`](interface-convention.md#3-the-exit-status-is-the-answer-empty-stdout-never-is) rule 3). Read first-party out of the installed Claude Code binary (`strings`, build 2.1.228), under *Before tool execution*:

```
Exit code 0 - stdout/stderr not shown
Exit code 2 - show stderr to model and block tool call
Other exit codes - show stderr to user only but continue with tool call
```

**`SessionStart` is the contrast, and it is stated here so nobody re-derives it.** The same binary's *When a new session is started* section reads `Exit code 2 - show stderr to user only`. So `2` carries no blocking power there at all — `fabrika hook check` cannot stop anything whatever it exits, and the whole exposure below is `PreToolUse`-only.

Both legs were also confirmed live on build 2.1.227: a probe hook on matcher `Task|Workflow` exiting `2` produced `PreToolUse:Agent hook error: …` and the subagent never ran, while the identical probe exiting `3` let the spawn through. That probe dates from when fabrika declared a spawn guard on that matcher. The one `PreToolUse` matcher it declares today is `Bash`.

The consequence is a **polarity**, not a style preference. A bootstrap or dispatch failure is a state in which no verb ran and no evidence exists, which must fail **open**; seating any such state on `2` makes it deny instead. Three sites did — `bin.ts`'s `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, and `delegate/entry.ts`'s foreign-checkout refusal and walk-fault — plus a fourth found while fixing them, `delegate/resolve.ts`'s spawn fault. All four now exit `126` ([`../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/verb.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/verb.ts), `NO_IMPLEMENTATION`), and the polarity is pinned by [`../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/hook/pretooluse-polarity.cli.test.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/hook/pretooluse-polarity.cli.test.ts), which runs the argv out of the committed declaration against a real cross-checkout refusal and asserts the exit code is not the blocking one.

**A deny never used an exit code anyway.** The retired `fabrika hook spawn` denied by returning exit **0** carrying `{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse","permissionDecision":"deny",…}}`, and `fabrika hook pre-bash` and `fabrika hook stash-guard` deny the same way. That JSON mechanism is independent of the exit status, so a `PreToolUse` hook that means to refuse says so without touching `2`. The exposure this section describes is **live** rather than latent: `pre-bash` is consulted on every Bash call, so a bootstrap failure seated on `2` would block the whole session's shell — which is what the polarity is pinned against.

**The allow side is the half that is easy to get wrong.** `permissionDecision: "allow"` is not "I have no objection": it bypasses the permission rules the operator configured. So a hook whose answer is "nothing to refuse here" emits no decision field at all, and `pre-bash`'s allow carries a fabrika-namespaced token the harness ignores — a positive answer for the convention's rule 2, and no decision for the harness.

<a id="the-dispatch-failure-policy-point"></a>
### The dispatch-failure policy point — a hook that cannot run fails open

A fabrika hook's verb can fail to run: a bare `fabrika` exits `127` on a machine with no install ([`../../../packages/fabrika-cli/docs/running-fabrika-in-a-repo.md`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/docs/running-fabrika-in-a-repo.md), *Install the CLI and confirm it runs*), and a cross-checkout invocation refuses with exit `126` ([`../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/delegate/resolve.ts`](../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/delegate/resolve.ts)). The convention reserves both for *the verb never ran*, which is never a verdict ([`interface-convention.md`](interface-convention.md#3-the-exit-status-is-the-answer-empty-stdout-never-is) rule 3).

**Ruled behaviour: fail open, and say so.** The harness event proceeds — a verb that never ran produced no evidence, so it may never deny. What is **banned is the silence**: the cannot-run state owes a visible degraded notice on stderr naming that the hook did not run and which defence is therefore absent. Fail-open-and-loud, never fail-open-and-forgotten. A verb that *runs* and returns a deny still fails closed as designed; the ruling touches the cannot-run case only.

There is **exactly one kind of place** that decides it, and it is the event a hook is declared on in [`../hooks.json`](../hooks.json). Rule 5 admits no wrapper script, so fabrika has nowhere to intercept an exit code from a process that never started; what a dispatch failure can do is therefore fixed by the event. `SessionStart` cannot abort anything. On `PreToolUse` the answer splits by **which** dispatch failure it is, and the split is the exit code:

- **Exit `127` — nothing ran.** No permission decision is produced, which the harness reads as no objection, so the Bash call proceeds **unguarded**. This is the fail-open the ruling describes, reached by the process's own absence.
- **Every other non-zero exit — the process ran and refused.** Its stderr is shown and the Bash call proceeds, per [the harness exit-code contract](#the-harness-exit-code-contract) above. This is fail-open-**and-loud**, which is what the ruling asks for.
- **Exit `2` — the Bash call is blocked.** Not fail-open at all. It is the one code that denies, so no fabrika exit code may take it; that is enforced in the exit tables rather than left to this prose.

This section previously grouped `2` and `127` together as "the verb never ran, so the spawn proceeds unguarded". That was true for `127` and **false for `2`**: while a bootstrap failure sat on `2`, a fabrika that could not resolve itself blocked every `Task`/`Workflow` spawn in the session, the matcher the retired spawn guard was declared on — the inverse of the ruling, recorded here as fact.

Failing *closed* still has no admissible form, and for the reason the ruling gives: it would mean minting the interception rule 5 forbids. Do not spread the behaviour to a per-verb site; this section is the one place a later ruling flips.

`hook pre-bash` and `hook stash-guard` make that cost real, and it is named rather than left implicit: a machine where `fabrika` does not resolve runs every Bash call with the escape refusal and the stash refusal silently absent — the exact silence each defence exists to remove.

**The notice is owed and only half-implementable today, so it is recorded rather than assumed.** On exit `126` the process did start and fabrika speaks for itself (`resolve.ts`'s foreign-checkout refusal). On exit `127` fabrika cannot speak, because `fabrika` is what failed to resolve — so that half has **no owner**, and its structural cure is installing the package: available to any machine that takes it, absent on any that does not. An adversarial review precedes any implementation of this horn in either direction.

## The hook verbs' derivations

Each `fabrika hook <verb> --help` owns calling the verb: its answer bytes and one line per exit. The
derivation facts behind five of them live here; `hook claude-spend`'s live in the
[Claude usage collector](claude-usage.md).

### `hook cli-floor`

The minimum is the `minimum` in `cli-floor.json` under `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`: the fabrika plugin's
declared minimum `@kampus/fabrika-cli` version, a variable the harness sets for the plugin's own
hooks. The verb reads no stdin. Its stdout is one hook-output JSON object at exit `0`. What the user
sees on each side of the minimum is stated [above](#the-declared-hooks-and-how-they-are-proven).
Below the minimum the object carries that warning as `systemMessage`; at or above it, it carries
`suppressOutput` and a `fabrika` token (`outcome: met`). Both carry `fabrika.installed` and
`fabrika.minimum`. Exit `23` is no plugin root, or the floor file or a version in it unreadable — the
comparison was not made, so it is UNKNOWN and never a pass. A non-zero exit on `SessionStart` shows
stderr and lets the session start.

### `hook pre-bash`

The jump is read through the wrappers named [above](#the-declared-hooks-and-how-they-are-proven). A
jump behind a word whose meaning is run-time — `eval`, a wrapper script — is out of key and allowed.
A jump whose target expands at run time is refused, because where it lands cannot be decided before
it runs. Where the verb arms, and why, is stated [above](#the-declared-hooks-and-how-they-are-proven);
the primary checkout and a cwd under no repository are therefore allowed untouched. Exit `19` is the one arm
where the cwd's working tree could not be established: the jump was NOT judged, and the command
proceeds. Why a deny is JSON at exit `0` and an allow carries no decision field is
[the harness exit-code contract](#the-harness-exit-code-contract).

### `hook stash-guard`

The verb reads every simple command on the line, including those inside `$( )`, backticks, a
subshell, a brace group, `sh -c '…'` and `eval`, and reads through `VAR=value` prefixes and the
wrappers `env`, `sudo`, `nice`, `command`, `exec`, `nohup` and `time`. A here-document body is data
and is not read. A `git` reached through an alias, a function, a variable or `xargs` is out of key and
allowed. Only a command that runs `git stash` costs a git call: the verb then runs
`git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-dir --git-common-dir` in the envelope's `cwd`, with a 5s
timeout. Absolute paths keep a cwd reached through a symlink from reading as two different dirs.
Exit `19` covers every state where those two dirs could not be read — a relative `cwd`, a `cwd` git
cannot start in, a failed or timed-out probe. The stash was NOT judged, and the command proceeds.
Why a deny is JSON at exit `0` and an allow carries no decision field is
[the harness exit-code contract](#the-harness-exit-code-contract).

### `hook worktree-create`

**The tree goes under the clone's primary working tree, never under the session's cwd.** The
envelope's `cwd` is where the session was launched, possibly a subdirectory or a linked worktree. So
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` runs there, and `git worktree list --porcelain -z` runs in the
toplevel it names, under `--dry-run` too. The tree is `<primary>/.claude/worktrees/<name>`, where
`<primary>` is the listing's first record. A `cwd` that resolves to no toplevel, or a clone whose
primary tree is bare or unreadable, refuses at `15` naming the `cwd`, with no fallback to it.

**It provisions and sweeps nothing.** No `fabrika build reap` runs here, so a spawn never waits on a
scan of the clone's other worktrees. `build reap` is a verb someone runs on purpose.

**It takes one repo-level lock around the fetch and the add, and nothing else.** The lock is
`fabrika/worktree-create.lock` in the clone's common git dir, shared by every worktree of the clone,
so parallel spawns take turns at those two commands. A lock whose holder's process is gone, or older
than 660s, is taken over. A live holder that keeps it past 240s, or a lock that cannot be created,
refuses on `24` with nothing fetched or added.

Under the lock it fetches the base into a per-spawn ref and resolves it to a commit id — never the
shared `FETCH_HEAD`, which a sibling spawn's fetch truncates mid-read. It then runs
`git worktree add --detach` at that id with git hooks switched off, and releases the lock. Only then
does it run the repo's own `post-checkout` hook itself (`git hook run post-checkout`), under a PATH
that resolves the toolchain, so the dependency installs of concurrent spawns overlap instead of
queueing. It refuses unless the tree exists and its virtual store landed.

The fetch and the add each still recover from the two sibling-worktree faults that a
`git worktree add` outside this hook, or a dead one, can cause: a fetch reading a half-built
`worktrees/<name>/HEAD`, and an add reading a half-built `worktrees/<name>/commondir`. Each prunes
dead worktree entries and re-attempts, bounded to five attempts and up to 3s of delay per command.
Any other diagnostic refuses on the first attempt. Every non-zero exit blocks the spawn.

### `hook plugin-sync`

It reads the `SessionStart` envelope on stdin and resolves the clone's primary worktree from its
`cwd` through the shared git common dir — never the session's own linked worktree. It fetches
`origin/<default>`; what it then does to the checkout, and what it leaves to the harness, is the
[`SessionStart` / `plugin-sync` note](#sessionstart-plugin-sync--a-checkout-move-left-to-the-repo).

**What it refuses.** A parked branch, a detached HEAD, a diverged branch, or uncommitted work the
incoming commits would write over is refused with its reason, because where a human's checkout sits
is a human's call. **Uncommitted work outside the incoming commits' paths is not one of those
states**: the refusal compares the uncommitted paths — untracked files included, each named
individually — against the paths the incoming range changes, and fires only on an overlap. That is
the same overlap `git merge --ff-only` itself refuses on.

**Every refusal leads stderr with its reason**, and carries the scope line and any install lines
after it. A failed `SessionStart` hook surfaces one line in the session, so a refusal whose first
line named the directory it judged named no cause at all.

**It reads the harness's own install records.** Every install still bound to an earlier commit is
named on stderr. Beyond the repository the
[note](#sessionstart-plugin-sync--a-checkout-move-left-to-the-repo) already rules out, the verb names
no marketplace or plugin either: the marketplace is selected by the directory it declares.

## The record format

A grading pass — auditing a hook layer being replaced, piece by piece — writes one `###` section per graded piece. Each section carries these fields, in this order, and nothing else:

| Field | What it must contain |
| --- | --- |
| **Verdict** | Exactly one of **PORT**, **REDESIGN**, **RETIRE**. One verdict per piece — never two, never a hedge. |
| **Graded against** | The files read, by repo-relative path, with the line or section that carries the claim, and the commit the line numbers are true at. |
| **What it does today** | The job, in the graded author's own terms, so the verdict is checkable against the thing being graded. |
| **The channel property that carries the verdict** | The specific property of the ruled delivery channel — quoted or cited to a line — that makes the verdict follow. A verdict without one is decoration. |
| **What is lost** | Mandatory. What guarantee this piece gave that the channel does not give back, and who would have noticed. Where something replaces it, say what the replacement *is* — a replacement that is weaker (a warning where the original refused, one branch where the original covered all of them) is stated as weaker, in those words. Write `nothing` only when the piece guarded nothing. |
| **UNKNOWN** | Mandatory, never omitted. What could not be checked first-hand — including a property this record leans on that lives on a branch with no end-to-end exercise. Write `none` explicitly when there is nothing. An unchecked thing is never written as a pass. |
| **Not graded here** | Deliberate scope boundaries and where each lands instead. Omit only when the record grades the whole piece. |
| **Owner** | The fabrika-side thing this lands against — a verb, the record set itself, or a follow-up issue. For PORT/REDESIGN, what carries the work. For RETIRE, what carries the residue named in **What is lost**, or `none` when nothing is left to carry. |

The rule behind the format: **a recorded outcome is a claim about reality, so the next reader must be able to re-derive it.** Cite the file and line; mark the uncheckable UNKNOWN.

Three of those fields exist because of how the first records were graded, and they are not interchangeable:

- **UNKNOWN and Not graded here are different fields on purpose.** "I could not check this" and "I deliberately did not grade this" are different claims, and one field cannot hold both — once a scope note occupies UNKNOWN, the real unknown has nowhere to go. That is not hypothetical: a record whose scope note took the UNKNOWN slot shipped an unproven property as a discharged one, and review caught it a round later.
- **UNKNOWN is mandatory with an explicit `none`** because an omittable field is self-certified — a grader who checks nothing and a grader who checked everything write the same empty space. An explicit `none` is a claim a reviewer can attack.
- **What is lost exists because RETIRE is the verdict that removes something.** A record whose dominant verdict is RETIRE and which has no field for the residue lets a real reduction in guarantee — a refusal traded for a silenceable warning — read as a clean discharge.

Two later amendments, stated here rather than applied silently:

- **The channel is not always the delivery channel.** A record grading a piece whose fate is decided by *how fabrika is delivered* cites a delivery-channel property. A record decided by something else — what the harness enforces natively on the version the repo runs — cites that instead. So **The channel property that carries the verdict** admits an observed harness behaviour, cited to the version and the observation. A behaviour asserted from a changelog or a doc page is not admissible in that field — only something run.
- **A PORT may name a narrower subject than the graded piece.** Several pieces survive in part: one of two refusals, one of two entry points. Writing PORT unqualified would hand a builder the whole original scope back, and writing RETIRE would drop the live half. Such a record states its verdict as **PORT**, and its first line names the shrunken subject. The dropped half is accounted for in **What is lost**, with the harness behaviour that covers it.
