# Use Fabrika in Codex

Install the CLI and initialize the repository using [adopt Fabrika](adopt-fabrika-in-a-new-repo.md).
The plugin supplies shared skills and references; the CLI supplies their deterministic verbs.
GitHub credentials, Node, Git, and Codex CLI must already work in the environment.

## Install the plugin

From your own repository, register the `kampus` marketplace from GitHub and install the plugin.
`<owner>/<repo>` is the GitHub repository that publishes the plugin, the `repository` field of
[`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](../.claude-plugin/plugin.json); the Codex manifest carries none:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add <owner>/<repo> --ref main
codex plugin add fabrika@kampus
```

Start a new session. Use `/plugins` to inspect the installed plugin. To pick up a newer plugin,
run `codex plugin marketplace upgrade kampus`, then restart the session to use the updated cached
skills.

In the plugin's source checkout only, register the working tree instead, since `./` must hold
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add ./
codex plugin add fabrika@kampus
```

`codex plugin add` copies the plugin into Codex's cache, so editing or pulling the checkout does
not change what Codex runs. After updating the checkout, re-run `codex plugin add fabrika@kampus`
and restart the session. `codex plugin marketplace upgrade` does not apply here: it refreshes Git
marketplaces only and refuses one added from a local path.

## Point Codex at the Fabrika section

Codex reads `AGENTS.md`, while `fabrika status bootstrap claude-md-section` writes `CLAUDE.md`
unless told otherwise. In a repository Codex works in, write the section to `AGENTS.md`:

```bash
fabrika status bootstrap claude-md-section --path AGENTS.md
```

When the repository also uses Claude Code, pick one of two setups:

- Keep one file: write the section to `AGENTS.md` and make `CLAUDE.md` a symlink to it
  (`ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`). Both tools then read the same instructions.
- Keep two files: run the verb once with `--path AGENTS.md` and once without `--path`, so each
  file carries the section. Edit both when the instructions change.

## Enable interactive usage collection

In a source checkout, merge the event entries from the checkout's
`packages/fabrika-cli/docs/codex-hooks.json` into the repository's `.codex/hooks.json`. Each of
`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SessionStart`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `Stop`, `Interrupt`
and `SessionEnd` gets one command hook running
`node "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/packages/fabrika-cli/src/spend/codex-hook.ts"`, with
`"timeout": 3` on `Interrupt` and `SessionEnd`. Create the file if absent; retain any existing
hooks. This uses Codex's supported repository hook path and writes no per-user configuration.

Restart Codex, trust the repository, then review and trust these definitions with `/hooks`.
Start Fabrika work normally. The hook binds the issue when Fabrika reads or claims it and replays
usage at later callbacks. Lane dispatch also collects without hooks.

Collection reads Codex 0.153.4 and 0.154.0 session files; another version records incomplete
coverage rather than guessing. Coverage is always `partial`, because readable files cannot prove
that no unseen subagent ran. Usage lands in
`.fabrika/spend-ledger.jsonl` in the primary checkout; `fabrika spend rollup` prints its totals
with that coverage. A recording error prints a warning and never changes the task's result.

## Recover interrupted collection

If the hook reports an unresolved issue association, run an issue read with a literal number,
such as `node packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts review criteria 123`. The next callback replays
that turn's retained native usage under the resolved issue.

To replay an interrupted dispatch, invoke the configured hook command with its original `cwd`,
`session_id` and `transcript_path` in the JSON on stdin. Its saved dispatch binding supplies the
work identity. Retain those native files until collection finishes.

## Dispatch a lane task

Ask Codex to use the shared `operate` skill. Its Codex route runs `fabrika lane dispatch` for
each active task. Supply the absolute directory containing the installed plugin's shared skills
and an absent worktree path outside the primary checkout. Resolve the skill directory from the
installed `operate` skill's location; do not guess a cache version.

```bash
fabrika lane dispatch 123 --task issue --harness codex --skills /installed/fabrika/skills --worktree /scratch/lane-123
```

The adapter creates a detached worktree, verifies its repository and commit, and runs the
repository's `dependencyReconciler` if declared. A repository requiring dependencies must declare
that command in `.fabrika.jsonc`. Each child receives a fixed instruction to read the selected
stage skills, followed by the emitted lane brief without changing its bytes. The child runs
`codex exec --cd` there. `fabrika lane dispatch --help` lists its refusals by exit code.

Exit zero from the child is not completion. Dispatch succeeds only when exactly one new terminal
addresses the task and the lane's artifact proof confirms it; route from the lane state, not the
dispatch exit code. Every worktree it creates stays on disk, and the child's output is kept beside
the ledger as `dispatch-<task>.stdout` and `dispatch-<task>.stderr`. Read those and the worktree
before retrying, and do not delete or reset a worktree just to retry. A killed dispatcher can leave
its lock directory behind: confirm its process is gone before removing the lock.

Codex's persistent model, reasoning, developer instructions, sandbox and approval configuration
remain authoritative: the adapter overrides none of them. So a Codex-dispatched shell's model is
the one Codex's own configuration resolves: the adapter runs `codex exec --cd <worktree> -`
with no `--model`, `--profile` or `-c` flag. Every role gets that same command, so there is no
per-role model pin on this route; `reviewer` and `builder` run on the same configured model.
Parent-chat transient settings are not a CLI configuration export; configure the child policy in
Codex before dispatch when such settings matter. Noninteractive approval failures remain failures.
Never add an unrestricted execution flag to make a blocked stage continue.

Session attribution preserves the existing precedence: `FABRIKA_SESSION_ID`, then
`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, then `PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_SESSION`, then `CODEX_THREAD_ID`, then
`CODEX_SESSION_ID`. Blank values fall through; an absent identity refuses dispatch. The adapter
carries the resolved identity into its child as `FABRIKA_SESSION_ID` so the lane remains attributed
to its driver.

## Host support

The shared Claude `agents/*.md` files are not Codex agent registrations. This route selects skills
inside the CLI; installing the plugin requires no custom Codex role configuration. Codex documents
custom agents separately under [Subagents — Custom agents](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/subagents#custom-agents).
The [plugin manifest](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/plugins#manifest-fields) packages
skills and supporting resources. The app's [worktree chats](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/environments/git-worktrees)
are a separate workflow from this adapter's verified Git worktrees.

The executable contract was checked against Codex CLI 0.153.4's `exec --help`: `--cd` selects the
working root and `-` reads the prompt from stdin. Automated dispatch tests use real Git and a fake
Codex executable; they do not spend model tokens or claim a live end-to-end pipeline run.
The `front-door` explicit-invocation policy is a separate skill contract; shared Claude frontmatter
may still be rejected by a packaging validator even when Codex loads the skill.
