# Why fabrika is shaped this way

fabrika turns an issue into a merged pull request through a chain of agents. Almost every design
question people ask about it comes down to the same worry: *why is this so many moving parts when
one agent could just do the work?* This page answers that. It argues the shape and leaves the full
argument to the repo's own decision records; none of it is a procedure, and no page here is where
you look up a flag.

## Stages are separate actors because a judgement needs someone who did not do the work

The chain is `report` → `triage` → `plan-epic` → `build` → `review` → `ship`, with `heal-ci` off to
the side for a pull request that has stopped moving. Each is its own skill. The stages a driver
spawns run in an agent shell from [`../agents/`](../agents/); `report`, `plan-epic` and `heal-ci`
have no shell: a session invokes them directly.

That chain is the text path, and the lane machine has more states than it names. A rendered surface
is built by `build-ui` and judged by `review-ui`. `review` fires a separate `governance` gate and
waits on its verdict. A pull request waiting in the merge queue and an epic child being folded into
its epic's branch are states of their own. The
[`operate` skill](../skills/operate/SKILL.md) holds the full state table.

The obvious alternative is one long-running agent that does all six. It fails on judgement. An agent
that just wrote a diff and then reviews it is answering "is this right?" holding every reason it
believed the diff was right — the reasons are in its context, and the argument for the work is the
argument for passing it. A separate reviewer starts from the issue and the diff, and nothing else.
The same split is why the reviewing agent reads its instructions from the base branch rather than
from the head it is judging: a gate that loads its own operating instructions out of the thing under
test is not a gate.

The separation also buys context. Each stage carries only its own question's material, so a long
epic never accumulates one enormous transcript where the early decisions have fallen off the end.

And it fixes authority. One stage owns each question and no other stage recomputes it: `ship` is the
only merge authority, `review` is the only thing that issues a verdict, `triage` is the only thing
that types and prioritizes an issue. Two answers to one question is the failure mode the whole
design is arranged against. The actors are named for the thing that acts rather than the act — a
`builder` runs `build` — precisely so "who is answering this" stays a question with a name in it.

Human capacity, not agent throughput, is what sizes the chain: batches are shaped to what a reviewer
can actually check, and the founder keeps one recurring seat rather than one per stage.

## A lane is a run, and its state is on disk because a session is not a place to keep state

A **lane** is one unit of work being driven — an issue, or a standing chore — with a state machine
over the stages it passes through. `operate` walks that machine, spawning the shell each state
names and folding the outcome back in.

The lane's state lives in `.fabrika/` on disk as an append-only log, and its ledger is folded fresh
each run. That is a deliberate rejection of the natural place to put it, which is the driving
agent's own context. A session ends, gets compacted, or crashes; a run whose state lived only there
cannot be resumed, cannot be inspected while it is happening, and cannot tell you afterwards what it
did. Anything a fresh process can fold off disk survives all three.

What may live there is bounded, and the boundary is the point: the log admits only orderings this
tree can own — drive-loop mechanics — and keeps shared truth on GitHub. A review verdict, a claim, a
label and a merge-queue position are facts other people and other machines read, so they
live where those readers already look. A local file asserting a verdict is a second source of truth,
and the two will disagree.

The claim is the same argument from the other side. It says "this issue is mine", and it does not
lapse when a run ends, because a run finishing is not the work finishing. The cost accepted there is
real: a claim can outlive the lane holding it, so reaping dead claims has to actually work.

## The planner does not gate its own plan, and a human sees it before the gate runs

`plan-epic` writes an epic's plan; `check-epic-plan` decides whether that plan is clean enough for
its children to become buildable. They are two skills for the same reason build and review are: the
author of a plan is the worst judge of whether it is complete. The gate is deterministic and
structural, and it enforces itself through state rather than advice — a child that has not passed is
labelled in a way that makes it unpickable, so "an unverified child got built" is not a thing that
can happen rather than a thing discouraged.

The human checkpoint sits between them, and it is not redundant with the gate. The gate is fifteen
structural defect classes; not one of them reads product intent. So an agent could write the user
stories, satisfy every structural rule, and produce a clean plan for the wrong product. The founder
approves the plan before the gate runs, and every epic is grilled while it is being planned rather
than after — asking after the plan is written turns an answer into a re-plan.

## An owner-only step confirms an account, not a person

fabrika keeps six steps for the repo's owner: the UI hand-check, the `pitch-approved:` comment, the
`bet` row on the betting table, `plan approve`, `decision rule`, and the sole-owner self-approval of
a control-plane pull request. Each is meant as a person's judgement. What each one checks is
smaller than that: which GitHub account acted.

That is all GitHub can show a tool. A comment has an author, a table field has an account that set
it, and a command runs under a token that belongs to an account. None of them records who was at
the keyboard. So the hand-check, `plan approve`, `decision rule` and the self-approval ask whether
the account is one the control-plane rows of `.github/CODEOWNERS` name, and the `pitch-approved:`
comment and the `bet` row ask whether the account has write access. Two of them also refuse a
comment that carries an agent's stamp, which catches an agent that signs its work and nothing else.

On a repo with one GitHub account, agents act as that account, so an agent can pass every one of
the six. The line between owner and agent is then a rule the agents keep, written into their
skills, and no check holds it. fabrika says this plainly instead of adding a proof step, because a
proof an agent on the same account cannot also produce does not exist on GitHub, and one that
pretends otherwise would be worse than none: the owner would trust a check that is not there.

A second GitHub account for agents turns four of the six into real checks, since an account that is
off the control-plane rows fails the roster. The two that read write access still pass it.
[Run agents under a second GitHub account](run-agents-under-a-second-account.md) has the steps. It
is optional, and a one-account repo works without it.

One check in this area is GitHub's own, and fabrika does not have to be trusted for it: a pull
request's author cannot approve that pull request. Where a repo has two or more control-plane
owners, a control-plane pull request needs an approving review from an owner account that did not
open it.

## An epic run produces one pull request, because the repair loop is what costs money

An epic has many children. The shape that looks obvious is one pull request per child: each is
independently reviewable and independently mergeable. fabrika ran that shape and moved off it.

Two things broke. Nothing ever looked at the epic as a whole — two children could each pass their
own gate and contradict each other — and every failed review round cost a push, a CI run and a
board write, on work that had not been accepted yet.

Now an epic run is one branch and one pull request. Children land as commits on it, each child's
review judges its own commit range locally, and the machine ends in one review of the whole pull
request before the single merge. The inner loop is the cheap one and it never leaves the machine;
the outer review looks for coherence rather than re-running correctness that already has a verdict.
That shape is ruled, and the per-child-pull-request engine it replaced is on the record beside it
with the founder's rationale. Single-issue lanes are untouched: one issue, one pull request.

The guarantee is a state in the machine rather than a step a skill is trusted to perform. A
convention written in prose gets skipped by an agent that forgot, and does not show up in the lane's
status.

## fabrika calls nothing outside fabrika, and the pipeline it replaced was deleted

fabrika replaced an earlier pipeline, v1. No fabrika skill and no fabrika verb ever ran v1 code.
Where v1 had already solved part of a problem, a fabrika session read that code to learn how it
behaved and what it got wrong, then wrote fabrika's own version. That was duplicated work, knowingly
paid for: a dependency edge into v1 is the thing that would have made deleting v1 impossible, and
the whole point of the rewrite was to be able to delete it.

The price bought what it was paid for. v1 was deleted, not frozen: its plugin and its CLI are gone
from the tree, and fabrika is the one pipeline. The repo that authors fabrika holds the record of
that deletion in its decision corpus. The alternative on the table was keeping the old tree as a
comparison baseline. It was refused because two skill rosters answering the same names is the
two-answers failure again, one level up.

The rule outlives v1, and it is about **calls**. A byte-level format is not a call. When two
programs meet on a GitHub artifact, that format is a contract, and fabrika owns it: one schema
module holds the shape and everything else cites it. Two hand-copied copies of a format drift
silently.

The one deferral that stays sanctioned is a CI gate. Where a gate is already the authority on its
own question, fabrika expects that gate's answer and computes no second verdict.
