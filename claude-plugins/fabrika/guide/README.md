# fabrika guide

fabrika is an agent pipeline that runs on a GitHub repo. You file an issue; a chain of agents
triages it, plans it, builds it, reviews it, and merges it, and every stage leaves its record on
the issue or the pull request rather than in a chat log. It ships for Claude Code, Codex and pi,
and works in any repo, not only the one it grew in.

These pages are written for a person. Each holds one Diátaxis mode.

## Which surface answers which question

- **`guide/`** — this directory: the human pages, one Diátaxis mode each.
- **[`../docs/`](../docs/README.md)** — the agent-facing convention and contract docs.
- **the host repo's decision records** — the why, and the history including superseded approaches.
- **`fabrika --help`** — every command group, one line each. `fabrika <group> --help` lists a
  group's verbs, and `fabrika <group> <verb> --help` gives one verb's flags, answer and exit codes.
- **[`../skills/`](../skills/)** — one `SKILL.md` per skill: the contracts agents execute.
  `fabrika status menu` prints the whole roster, one row per skill with its description.
