Changes: the description is narrowed and names its non-scopes; the whole-
subsystem mode is renamed "subsystem sweep" (SWEEP.md); Discovery, Validation
and Landing are made repository-neutral and bounded to one ticket and one
pull request, with outside work routed to fabrika's report skill; Discovery
first reads open pull requests and sets aside in-flight candidates; a repo-wide
audit mode (REPO-WIDE.md) files one ranked ticket, Discovery's in-flight read
opens it too, and Discovery's cross-cutting pass follows its exclusion rule.

# Test Audit

Four modes, one value bar. Authoring mode gates a new test at write time.
Audit mode runs a focused sweep of tests that re-assert source, duplicate
stronger proof, couple behavior to implementation, or keep test-only production
seams alive; optimize for confidence, not deletion count. A **subsystem sweep**
prunes one whole subsystem's test surface (every test file a plugin or core area
owns); before starting one, read [SWEEP.md](SWEEP.md). A **repo-wide audit**
reads every test in a repository; it is read-only, edits no test or source file,
and lands as one ranked ticket filed through [`report`](../report/SKILL.md);
before starting one, read [REPO-WIDE.md](REPO-WIDE.md).

Every other mode works inside the current ticket and lands as at most one pull
request. Candidates, defects or cleanups found outside that ticket leave
through [`report`](../report/SKILL.md) as follow-up issues, never as more
edits here.

## Authoring gate

Before adding any test, answer four questions; a missing answer means do not
add it yet:

1. What observable behavior, invariant, or independent contract does it protect?
2. What credible regression makes it fail?
3. Why does existing coverage not already catch that failure? Each contract has
   one primary test owner at the strongest boundary; another layer needs its
   own distinct risk, such as a transport or lifecycle failure the owner cannot
   reach. Prefer extending a table-driven case or shared fixture over a
   near-duplicate test; consolidate duplicated setup in the same change.
4. Does it need a production seam (export, flag, wrapper, injection hook) that no
   production caller needs? If yes, move the test to the real boundary instead.

Then check the test against every [junk pattern](#junk-patterns); a match fails
the gate unless the [retention bar](#retention-bar) names the contract it
independently guards. A test that would break under behavior-preserving
refactoring is asserting implementation, not behavior; rewrite it at the
owning boundary before landing it.

Bug regression tests must fail on the pre-fix code for the intended reason and
pass after the owner-boundary repair. A regression test that never demonstrably
failed proves the mock, not the fix. One regression at the owner boundary
covers the bug; do not replay the same scenario at every layer it crosses.

## Junk patterns

The shared checklist for every mode: the authoring gate rejects a new test that
matches one, and audits hunt for existing tests that do.

- assertion-free coverage probes;
- self-comparisons and identity copiers;
- copied fixtures, inventories, manifests, or export lists;
- exact source, import, or string greps;
- private predicate or call-shape tests duplicated at real boundaries;
- duplicate invocations of the same contract;
- provider-local replays of shared helpers;
- tests whose only purpose is preserving test-only exports, globals, or wrappers;
- dead production code whose only callers are tests;
- expected values produced by the helper or renderer under test;
- mocks that implement the asserted behavior, or one identical mock standing in
  for different APIs;
- fixtures that supply the receipt, admission, or callback ordering the owner
  should produce, or persistence asserted against a store the path never writes;
- capability tests that restate declared flags instead of exercising the
  delivery or acknowledgement the flag promises;
- negative controls that pass for an unrelated reason, such as a denial from a
  different guard or a rejection the production path never reaches;
- names or fixtures that promise more than the input exercises, such as a
  "retires the window" test asserting the window was not cleared.

## Value bar

Tests justify their maintenance cost by protecting behavior, a credible
regression, or an independently meaningful contract. In an audit, an existing
test that must change for behavior-preserving source reorganization is suspect,
not automatically deletable; the authoring gate still rejects new ones.

Before judging a candidate, read the complete test and production owner, its
entry point, callers, callees, sibling implementations, overlapping tests, CI
routing, and relevant history. Read root and scoped `AGENTS.md` files first.
When the test claims dependency-backed behavior, inspect the dependency source
or types directly.

## Discovery

Keep discovery read-only and report evidence before editing.

Before any pass, read the **in-flight set**: the repository's open pull
requests and the files each one changes. Hand that set to every pass. This read
opens discovery in audit mode, in a subsystem sweep and in a repo-wide audit
alike.

For a broad scope the ticket names, run parallel read-only passes when
available:

- one pass per top-level source area the repository's `AGENTS.md` names;
- UI, apps, scripts, and tooling;
- a cross-cutting pattern sweep, reporting only candidates no single area pass
  owns, under the repo-wide audit's
  [exclusion rule](REPO-WIDE.md#3-area-and-cross-cutting-passes).

Outside a subsystem sweep, prefer a few high-confidence candidates over a large
speculative inventory. Hunt for the [junk patterns](#junk-patterns).

A candidate whose test file or production owner an open pull request deletes
or modifies is **in flight**. Record it as `in flight: <pull request>`, leave
its files to that pull request so this batch edits none of them, and list it in
the [handoff](#handoff). When it still needs work after that pull request
merges, file it through `report` as a follow-up naming the pull request it
waits on.

Done when the in-flight set was read before the first pass, each candidate in
scope is either in flight with its pull request named or has its
[candidate evidence](#candidate-evidence) recorded, and candidates outside the
ticket are filed through `report`.

## Retention bar

Keep a test when it independently enforces a public API, plugin SDK, protocol,
config, migration, storage, security, platform, default, prompt-byte, generated
cross-language, package, release, or architecture contract. Also keep:

- call ordering when order is observable behavior;
- regressions with a credible failure mode;
- source inspection when it is the cheapest independent guard: it fails when
  the contract changes (the user-facing key, byte, or path) and survives an
  identifier-only refactor;
- a retained test that fails on the baseline: treat it as a possible product
  bug, reproduce it, and repair the owner when the ticket covers it, else file
  it through `report`, rather than deleting it.

Static or slow is not a deletion reason. A test that resembles implementation
may still be the independent contract; prove otherwise before removing it.

## Candidate evidence

Record every field below before editing. A missing field means the candidate is
not ready for deletion:

- exact test name and location;
- what failure it can actually detect;
- non-test callers of the covered production or support seam;
- stronger remaining owner-boundary proof, or why no proof is needed;
- relevant history and the reason the test or seam exists;
- open pull requests touching the test or its production owner, or none; any
  one that deletes or modifies them makes the candidate
  [in flight](#discovery);
- production or test-support deletion unlocked;
- risk and the focused validation command.

## Edit shape

Choose one coherent owner-boundary batch inside the ticket. Within it, delete
obsolete test-only exports, globals, wrappers, and production paths whose only
callers were the deleted tests, instead of preserving aliases. Move retained
regressions to their canonical owners. Consolidate repeated package or
dependency assertions into one generic contract.

Prefer net-negative production LOC. Do not add replacement tests that restate
the same implementation, and do not convert uncertain candidates into cleanup
to increase deletion counts.

Done when every edit traces to a candidate with full evidence and nothing
outside the batch changed.

## Validation

Validate through the loaded [`build`](../build/SKILL.md) skill; it owns which
checks and tests run. This skill adds only what a deletion needs. Never edit
source or tests while a test run is going in the same checkout.

1. Run the smallest owner and sibling tests first.
2. For a removed source grep or plan assertion, run the script or dry run that
   owns the real contract.
3. Inspect the diff's line counts; report production code separately from tests
   and test support.

Done when `build`'s validation is green and steps 1 to 3 are recorded for the
hand-off.

## Landing

Follow the loaded `build` skill: open a pull request only when the task asks
for one, never merge, and never review your own change. One ticket lands one
coherent batch; the next batch is a new ticket filed through `report`.

## Handoff

Report:

- root cause and removed low-value categories;
- production owner simplifications;
- retained false positives and why they remain valuable;
- in-flight candidates, each with the pull request it waits on;
- focused proof actually run;
- production versus test LOC;
- follow-ups filed through `report`.
