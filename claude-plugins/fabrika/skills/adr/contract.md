# `/adr` — derived CLI contract

**Skill:** [`adr`](SKILL.md) · **Date:** 2026-08-01

**The seed package.** These are fabrika's first derived verbs, so this spec is where the verb
package lands. The package is `packages/fabrika-cli/`, its binary is `fabrika`, and this skill's
verbs sit under an `adr` subcommand group. The
[CLI interface convention](../../docs/cli-interface-convention.md) governs all seven; where this spec
and that doc disagree, the doc wins and this spec is the bug.

**`fabrika` calls the retired v1 pipeline CLI nowhere, and neither does the skill.** fabrika is
self-contained by construction: every verb this skill needs is implemented in
`packages/fabrika-cli/`, and no fence in `SKILL.md` invokes anything else. That is the [isolation rule](../../docs/cli-interface-convention.md);
it is a hard constraint on every fabrika skill, not a preference of this one.

The reason is the deletion test. A fabrika that calls the tool it replaces can never be the thing
that replaces it — every call is a tether that keeps the old tree alive. Isolation costs a duplicated
ranking during the transition; a tether costs the ability to ever delete anything.

**`adr classify` was considered and deliberately not derived.** The control-plane question is settled
at the merge gate, and that gate is the authority. A fabrika copy of it could tell an author
"ordinary" while the gate says "control-plane" — two answers to a merge-gating question, which is
worse than either a tether or a drifted ranking. That reasoning holds under either model, and the two
differ: the retired v1 classifier read an ADR **by content**, reached because no decision-corpus path
matched its path pattern, while fabrika's ruled model is CODEOWNERS-only, three-valued, and has **no
semantic detection**, so under it an ADR is not control plane — see
[§CP classification](../../docs/control-plane-classification.md). Either way the skill states the
expectation, never rewords to dodge the gate, and leaves the verdict where it is enforced. The
incidents behind it were the *gate* misclassifying, so an author-side predictor would not have caught
them anyway.

## Verb inventory

| Verb | Purpose | Split test |
|---|---|---|
| `adr next` | the next unused ADR id, against a fetched base ref unioned with open ADR PRs and the claims on this clone's branch refs, remote-tracking ones included | fetch, parse ids, take the max, add one — no judgment anywhere in it |
| `adr new` | scaffold `NNNN-slug.md` under the record directory from the canonical template | the file's *shape* is fixed text with substitutions; only its content is judgment |
| `adr mint` | allocate the next id and scaffold its record in one invocation | both halves are already derived; fusing them removes a window rather than adding judgment |
| `adr resolve` | resolve an id to its real filename and state against a fetched base ref | a lookup with a defined answer; whether the result may be cited stays in the skill |
| `adr supersede` | rewrite an older ADR's `status:` line to `superseded by [NNNN](…)` | *deciding* to supersede is judgment; the one-line edit and its link are mechanical |
| `adr amend-in-part` | append this ADR to an older one's `amended-in-part by` list | as above, plus the list-append and refusal rules an author gets wrong by hand |
| `adr sweep` | rank the uncited live-accepted ADRs this one may contradict | ranking is deterministic — scan, score, sort; only *judging* the hits is the skill's |

**Considered and not derived.** A verb for step 3's dated `## Amendments` note. It is mechanical, but
the note's *content* is judgment and its shape is one line the skill already carries, so a verb would
move one line and add a block. Recorded here so it is not silently re-proposed as a gap.

## Shared conventions

Every verb below obeys these; they are stated once rather than repeated per block.

- **Answer channel: machine.** Stdout carries the answer and nothing else. Scope lines, refusal
  reasons and progress go to stderr.
- **Common inputs.** `--dir <path>` is the record directory; with the flag absent it is
  `.fabrika.jsonc`'s `decisionsDir`, itself defaulting to `.decisions`. A repo that declines that key
  keeps no corpus, and every verb here refuses on `22` rather than reading or writing one. `--base <ref>`
  (default: the trunk, `origin/<the repo's GitHub default branch>`) is the base ref, **fetched before it is read** — reading a stale local ref
  is the whole defect class this contract exists to close. `--repo <owner/name>` (default: resolved
  from the `origin` remote) is the repository whose open pull requests form the in-flight set.
  `--json` swaps the line grammar for one JSON object with the named keys given per verb.
- **Reserved exit codes.** `0` = the answer is on stdout. `1` = usage error, or the verb failed to
  run. `127` = the verb never ran. `3` and up are proven outcomes.
- **One exit table for the whole group.** Every verb allocates from
  [`adr/codes.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/adr/codes.ts), so a code means one thing
  whichever verb produced it. Each verb's block below lists only the codes it can reach; none of them
  re-seats a number.

  | Code | Meaning | next | resolve | new | mint | supersede / amend-in-part | sweep |
  |---|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
  | `0` | the answer is on stdout | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
  | `1` | usage error, or the verb failed to run | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
  | `7` | the record the caller named is not there | | | | | ✓ | ✓ |
  | `11` | the record directory could not be read, so the outcome is UNKNOWN | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
  | `12` | the target path already exists — refused, never overwritten | | | ✓ | ✓ | | |
  | `13` | `--by` has no record under `--dir` | | | | | ✓ | |
  | `14` | `<id>` has no single rewritable `status:` line | | | | | ✓ | |
  | `15` | the rewrite would have touched another line — nothing written | | | | | ✓ | |
  | `16` | `<id>` is already `superseded by …` | | | | | ✓ | |
  | `17` | `--base` could not be fetched, so the merged set is UNKNOWN | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | | |
  | `18` | the open pull requests could not be enumerated | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | | |
  | `19` | a record under `--dir` has a filename with no readable id | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | | |
  | `20` | two records under `--dir` claim one id | | ✓ | | | | |
  | `21` | `--repo` was not given and the `origin` remote could not be read | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | | |
  | `22` | `.fabrika.jsonc` declines `decisionsDir` — this repo keeps no corpus | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

  `7` and `11` are the two seats this group shares with `report`'s table, code for code, so a caller
  driving both reads one meaning: the target is not there, and the read that would have proven it
  failed. **`5` is a vacated seat, never a free one** — it meant "the record directory was read and
  is empty, refusing" until an empty corpus became an answer instead, and a new meaning there would
  hand a caller pinned to the old reading a wrong answer under a familiar number. The group's own
  band starts at `12`, which puts it out of reach.
- **A non-zero exit is UNKNOWN.** No verb prints a partial or permissive answer on a non-zero exit;
  a caller reads the status before the bytes.
- **GitHub access follows [skill conventions §11 — REST, never GraphQL](../../docs/skill-conventions.md)**
  — REST, paginated. The reason lives there, not here. What is local to this group: a pull request
  that adds its record past the first page of its file list still claims that id, so the paginate
  half is load-bearing for `adr next`.

## `adr next`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika adr next [--dir <path>] [--base <ref>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--dir` | string | no | `decisionsDir`, else `.decisions` | the directory of `NNNN-slug.md` decision records to scan |
| `--base` | string | no | the trunk | the base ref to fetch and read the merged set from; with none named, an unresolvable trunk is `17` |
| `--repo` | string | no | the `origin` remote's `owner/name` | the repository whose open pull requests form the in-flight set |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the full allocation record instead of the bare id |

**Output** — one line, the zero-padded four-digit id, newline-terminated. With `--json`, one object
with keys `id`, `mergedMax`, `inFlight` (array of ids, ascending), `branchClaims` (array of ids,
ascending), `baseRef`, `baseSha`. There is no empty answer: see Scope.

**The id is the maximum of the union, plus one — never the first free number in it.** A gap below
the maximum is a number some pull request claimed and never merged, and re-issuing it points every
citation of the abandoned ADR at a different decision. The worked example below is chosen to
discriminate the two rules: `mergedMax 9236` with `inFlight [9237, 9239]` answers `9240`, where
first-free would answer `9238`.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | the id was produced on stdout |
| `1` | usage error, or the verb failed to run |
| `11` | `--dir` could not be read at the fetched `--base`, so the merged set is UNKNOWN |
| `17` | `--base` could not be fetched, so the merged set is UNKNOWN |
| `18` | the open pull requests could not be enumerated, so the in-flight set is UNKNOWN |
| `19` | a record under `--dir` has a filename with no readable id |
| `21` | `--repo` was not given and the `origin` remote could not be read, so the in-flight set is UNKNOWN |
| `23` | this clone's branch refs could not be walked, so the branch-claim set is UNKNOWN |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `adr next: cannot fetch <ref>: <reason> — the merged set is UNKNOWN. Re-run; do not answer from the local tree.` | 17 | refusal |
| `adr next: cannot enumerate open pull requests in <repo>: <reason> — the in-flight set is UNKNOWN, never "nothing reserved". Re-run; do not fall back to the on-disk id.` | 18 | refusal |
| `adr next: cannot read PR #<n>'s file list: <reason> — the in-flight set is INCOMPLETE, so it is UNKNOWN.` | 18 | refusal |
| `adr next: cannot read <dir> at <ref>: <reason> — the merged set is UNKNOWN, never "0 records".` | 11 | refusal |
| `adr next: <dir> holds a record with an unparseable id: <name>` | 19 | refusal |
| `adr next: cannot resolve --repo from the origin remote: <reason> — the in-flight set is UNKNOWN.` | 21 | refusal |
| `adr next: cannot walk this clone's branch refs against <sha>: <reason> — the ids claimed on unpublished branches are UNKNOWN, never "nothing claimed".` | 23 | refusal |

**Scope** — every `NNNN-slug.md` under `--dir` **as of the fetched `--base`**, plus every open pull
request in `--repo` that *adds* an `NNNN-*.md` file under that same directory, plus every
`NNNN-*.md` under that directory on a branch ref **this clone carries** that the fetched base does
not — local branches and fetched remote-tracking ones alike, since the walk passes
`--branches --remotes`. So a branch pushed from another clone is in the set as soon as this one has
fetched it, which is the ordinary reason an id jumps further than the base and the open pull
requests explain; an unpushed branch in another clone is still invisible, and that is the residual
the mint section names.
The scope line goes to stderr on every run, naming the base SHA, the record count, the in-flight
count and the branch-claim count, so a caller can audit which third produced the answer.

The three sets fail differently, and the difference is load-bearing:

- **An empty merged set is a fact, and the answer is `0001`.** The read itself proves the directory:
  the merged set is read as `git ls-tree <base-sha>:<dir>`, which fails outright when `<dir>` is not
  in the tree, so a listing that comes back empty is a directory that **exists and holds nothing** —
  a repo adopting fabrika on day one. Only a directory that could not be read is UNKNOWN, and that is
  exit `11`. The two states never share a code.
- **An empty in-flight set is a fact — but only on exit 0.** No open ADR pull request is a normal
  state. An in-flight set that could not be read is exit `18` and prints nothing on stdout, because a
  caller that reads an empty set as "nothing reserved" silently falls back to the on-disk id, which
  is exactly the collision this verb removes.
- **An empty branch-claim set is a fact — but only on exit 0.** No branch carrying an unpublished
  record is a normal state. A ref walk that failed is exit `23`, on the in-flight half's precedent:
  a caller reading it as "nothing claimed" is back to handing two sibling lanes one id.

**The branch-claim set is a claim set, never a corpus.** A branch may carry anything under the
record directory, so a name no id parses out of is skipped rather than refused — `index.md` on an
abandoned branch is not a malformed record, and refusing over it would make a live repo unmintable.
The strict reading (`19`) stays on the base ref, where the corpus of record is. The walk counts every
record path a branch *touches*, not only the ones it adds: a `--diff-filter` would have to decide
what a renumbering rename is, and a modified or deleted record's id is on the base ref already, so
counting it cannot raise a maximum the merged set does not hold.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika adr next
9240
```

```
$ fabrika adr next --json
{"id":"9240","mergedMax":"9236","inFlight":["9237","9239"],"branchClaims":[],"baseRef":"origin/main","baseSha":"49a22902d1e0c7b3f5a8e4126b9d0f3c7a1e5b82"}
```

A sibling lane minted `9240` on a branch — in this clone, or in another clone that has pushed it and
this one has fetched — and opened no pull request. The merged set and the in-flight set both read
`9240` as free; the branch half is what does not:

```
$ fabrika adr next --json
{"id":"9241","mergedMax":"9236","inFlight":["9237","9239"],"branchClaims":["9240"],"baseRef":"origin/main","baseSha":"49a22902d1e0c7b3f5a8e4126b9d0f3c7a1e5b82"}
```

An adopting repo whose record directory exists and holds no records — the merged set is empty, and
no open pull request or branch claims an id, so `max(∅ ∪ ∅ ∪ ∅) + 1` is the first id:

```
$ fabrika adr next
0001
```

```
$ fabrika adr next --repo o/nonexistent
adr next: cannot enumerate open pull requests in o/nonexistent: HTTP 404 — the in-flight set is UNKNOWN, never "nothing reserved". Re-run; do not fall back to the on-disk id.
$ echo $?
18
```

**Grounding**

- **Two lanes minting one id, both pull requests green, is the collision this verb exists for.** It
  has happened repeatedly, and fetching the base ref before reading it closes the stale-local-tree
  half of it.
- **A branch is a reservation too, and leaving it out had a default-case victim.** An epic child
  builds in its own worktree on a local branch, opens no pull request, and folds into the assembly
  branch at the tail — so for the whole life of a phase its mint was invisible to the merged set and
  the in-flight set alike, and two parallel children were each told the same id was free. That is
  not a race that sometimes fires: parallel children are the normal shape of a phase, and it landed
  twice. Worktrees of one clone share `refs/heads`, so reading the branch refs is what makes a
  sibling's commit visible the moment it exists.
- **The in-flight reservation lock.** An open pull request that *adds* an `NNNN-*.md` record **is**
  the reservation for `NNNN`, so the in-flight set joins the merged one. The allocation over that
  union is `max(union) + 1`, never the first integer free in it: a gap below the maximum is a number
  some pull request claimed and abandoned, and re-issuing it silently points every citation of the
  abandoned record at a different decision. A gap costs nothing; a reused id costs a citation its
  meaning.
- **Zero scope reds for a gate; an allocator is not a gate.** A gate's empty scan means it checked
  nothing, so refusing is right there. A legitimately empty scope is a fact to make explicit instead,
  and a repo adopting fabrika has an empty corpus by definition — refusing there leaves its first
  record unmintable on the one documented path.
- **The residual race is real and this verb does not close it.** Two authors between the same pair of
  invocations still collide, and so do two lanes in two *different* clones, whose branches never
  reach one ref store. A repo's own duplicate-id check reds the second-to-merge pull request in
  CI, and the skill's step 6 re-check catches it for the caller's own id before the pull request
  opens. A verb that claimed to close it would be lying; state the residual in `--help`.
- **A proven refusal never shares an exit code with a failure to invoke** — a caller cannot tell the
  two apart from the status alone, and reads a crash as a verdict.

## `adr new`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika adr new 9240 only-landed-adrs-may-be-cited [--dir <path>] [--status <text>] [--date <YYYY-MM-DD>] [--title <text>] [--tags <a,b>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<id>` | positional string | yes | — | the four-digit zero-padded id this ADR claims |
| `<slug>` | positional string | yes | — | the kebab-case slug, at most 5 words |
| `--dir` | string | no | `decisionsDir`, else `.decisions` | the directory to write the record into |
| `--status` | string | no | `accepted` | the frontmatter `status:` value |
| `--date` | string | no | today, `YYYY-MM-DD` | the frontmatter `date:` value |
| `--title` | string | no | the slug, de-hyphenated | the frontmatter `title:` value and the H1 |
| `--tags` | string | no | empty | comma-separated frontmatter tags |

**Output** — one line, the path written, newline-terminated. With `--json`, one object with keys
`path`, `id`, `slug`.

The file's bytes are the canonical template, and **this block is that template's single home** — the
skill does not carry a copy to drift against:

```markdown
---
id: NNNN
title: <one decision-carrying clause, ≤ ~12 words — this is the compact-map row>
status: accepted
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: []
---

# NNNN — <Title, verbatim from the frontmatter title>

**What this decides:** <one plain sentence a non-author parses cold.>

## Context

<Why this came up — situation, constraint, prior pain. Name any ADR this supersedes or amends.>

## Decision

**<One bolded declarative sentence.>**

<Then the mechanics, declarative. No hedging.>

## Consequences

<What this makes easier / harder. Any migration cost.>
```

Two terminal sections are **not** scaffolded, because an empty one invites filler: `## Records` for
merge-time bookkeeping (`Closes #N`, blocks cleared, the vocabulary-impact outcome) and
`## Amendments` for dated forward notes. The skill adds them when it has content for them.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | the file was written and its path is on stdout |
| `1` | usage error, or the verb failed to run — including `<id>` that is not four digits and `<slug>` that is not kebab-case |
| `12` | the target path already exists — refused, never overwritten |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `adr new: <path> already exists — refusing to overwrite.` | 12 | refusal |
| `adr new: id "<id>" is not four zero-padded digits.` | 1 | usage error |
| `adr new: slug "<slug>" is not kebab-case (lowercase letters, digits and single hyphens).` | 1 | usage error |
| `adr new: cannot write <path>: <reason>` | 1 | refusal |

**Scope** — not a judging verb. It writes exactly one file and never edits another. It does not check
whether the id is claimed; that is `adr next`, `adr mint` and `adr resolve`.

**Examples** — every example that prints a record path shows a repo whose `decisionsDir` is
`docs/decisions`, and with the key absent the same runs write under the shipped default instead. The
exception is `adr sweep`'s two runs, which name a committed fixture corpus by `--dir` and carry that
corpus's own ids.

```
$ fabrika adr new 9240 only-landed-adrs-may-be-cited
docs/decisions/9240-only-landed-adrs-may-be-cited.md
```

```
$ fabrika adr new 9126 one-record-per-decision
adr new: docs/decisions/9126-one-record-per-decision.md already exists — refusing to overwrite.
$ echo $?
12
```

**Grounding**

- The template is the retired v1 skill's, trimmed. It lives here rather than in `SKILL.md` because a
  template in two places is a template that drifts, and the skill's job is the judgment the template
  cannot carry.
- The `**What this decides:**` line is required on every record: the person who ratifies a decision
  reads that line, not the dense agent-facing prose beneath it.

---

## `adr mint`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika adr mint only-landed-adrs-may-be-cited [--dir <path>] [--base <ref>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--status <text>] [--date <YYYY-MM-DD>] [--title <text>] [--tags <a,b>] [--json]
```

**Inputs** — `adr next`'s `--dir` / `--base` / `--repo`, plus `adr new`'s `<slug>`, `--status`,
`--date`, `--title` and `--tags`. There is no `<id>`: allocating it is the point.

**Output** — one line, the path written, newline-terminated. With `--json`, one object with keys
`path`, `id`, `slug`, `mergedMax`, `inFlight`, `branchClaims`, `baseRef`, `baseSha`.

**Exit status** — every code `adr next` can reach (`11`, `17`, `18`, `19`, `21`, `23`), plus
`adr new`'s `12`, plus `1` for a `<slug>` that is not kebab-case. Refusal messages are `adr next`'s
and `adr new`'s verbatim under an `adr mint:` prefix.

**Order is the contract: allocate, then write.** A refused allocation writes nothing, so a run that
could not read the merged or in-flight set leaves the tree exactly as it found it. The scope line
rides a refused write too — an id that turns out to be taken on disk is only readable against the
sets it was allocated from. The one thing checked ahead of the allocation is the `<slug>`: it is a
usage error, and it should not cost a fetch and a full pull-request enumeration to hear about, so
its `1` carries no scope line.

**Scope** — it decides only the order. Allocation is `adr next`'s read and the write is `adr new`'s,
shared as code rather than restated, because two copies of the four UNKNOWN branches is two places
for one of them to become an answer.

**Why it exists.** `adr next` then `adr new` leaves the author's whole drafting turn between reading
an id and writing it, and an id read then is stale by the time it lands: that gap has put one id on
two pull requests and cost a dismissed approval. **It is not a reservation and must never be
described as one** — the commit is visible through the branch-claim set to another lane of
*this clone*, and to a lane in another clone once that branch is pushed and fetched, but an
unpushed branch in another clone is seen only when the pull request opens, so the mint-to-open window
survives across clones and nothing downstream closes it. A repo's own duplicate-id check
reading the merge queue's batched ref *reports* a duplicate there, but a job that is not a
branch-protection-required context does not hold the batch, so it merges and the lane that opened
second renumbers on the default branch afterwards. `adr next`
and `adr new` stay callable on their own for the cases that genuinely need the id before the file.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika adr mint only-landed-adrs-may-be-cited
adr mint: scanned docs/decisions at 49a2290…, 236 decision records; 3 id(s) in flight across the open pull requests of o/r; 0 id(s) claimed on branch refs with no pull request.
docs/decisions/9240-only-landed-adrs-may-be-cited.md
```

```
$ fabrika adr mint only-landed-adrs-may-be-cited
adr mint: cannot enumerate open pull requests in o/r: <reason> — the in-flight set is UNKNOWN, never "nothing reserved". Re-run; do not fall back to the on-disk id.
$ echo $?
18
```

---

## `adr resolve`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika adr resolve 9164 [--dir <path>] [--base <ref>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

One or more ids may be given; each produces one line, in argument order. One fetch serves them all.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<id>...` | positional string, repeatable | yes | — | the four-digit ids to resolve |
| `--dir` | string | no | `decisionsDir`, else `.decisions` | the directory of decision records to resolve against |
| `--base` | string | no | the trunk | the base ref to fetch and resolve against; with none named, an unresolvable trunk is `17` |
| `--repo` | string | no | the `origin` remote's `owner/name` | the repository whose open pull requests form the in-flight set |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit one object per id instead of the line grammar |

**Output** — one **tab-separated** line per id: `<state>`, `<file>`, `<detail>`.

| `state` | `file` | `detail` |
|---|---|---|
| `live` | the record's filename under `--dir`, at `--base` | the frontmatter `status:` value, verbatim |
| `landed` | the record's filename — present on the base ref, but not live | the frontmatter `status:` value, verbatim |
| `in-flight` | the filename the open pull request adds | `PR #<n>` |
| `absent` | `-` | `-` |

**`live` and `landed` split presence from authority, and the split is the point.** Presence alone is
what a caller wrongly reads as "citable": a corpus of any age carries a substantial minority of
records that are present and *not* live — `superseded`, `proposed`, `superseded-in-part`, `retired`,
`moot`, `reference`. A verb that answered `landed` for every present record would license citing
every one of them.

fabrika owns this predicate; it does not import one. The semantics: `accepted` is live, and so is
`amended-in-part`, whose unamended remainder still stands. `proposed` is not yet live and
`superseded` is no longer. An existing liveness predicate elsewhere in a repo is a **reference for
what the words mean**, never a dependency — read it to check the semantics agree, then implement
fabrika's own.

With `--json`, a **JSON array** — one object per id, in argument order, with keys `id`, `state`,
`file`, `detail`, `baseRef`, `baseSha`. An array rather than JSON-lines, so a single id and many ids
parse identically and a caller never has to branch on the count.

**All four states are answers, and each is a positive token.** `absent` on exit 0 means *proven
absent against a current tree*: the fetch succeeded, the records were read, the open pull requests
were enumerated, and no one holds this id. It is never what a failed read prints.

**Its scope is the two published sets, not `adr next`'s three.** This verb answers where a record
*is* — a file on the base ref, or a pull request adding one — and a commit on somebody's branch is
neither, so a branch claim has no state here to be. The consequence is worth naming: `absent` does
not say a sibling worktree has not already minted this id, only that nothing published holds it.
`adr next` is where that third set is read.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | a state line was produced for every id given |
| `1` | usage error, or the verb failed to run |
| `11` | `--dir` could not be read at the fetched `--base`, so every state is UNKNOWN |
| `17` | `--base` could not be fetched, so every state is UNKNOWN |
| `18` | the open pull requests could not be enumerated, so `absent` cannot be distinguished from `in-flight` |
| `19` | a record under `--dir` has a filename with no readable id |
| `20` | two records under `--dir` claim one id, so every state over it would be arbitrary |
| `21` | `--repo` was not given and the `origin` remote could not be read, so `absent` cannot be distinguished from `in-flight` |

`5` is vacated here for the group-wide reason above; no verb re-seats it.

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |

| `adr resolve: cannot fetch <ref>: <reason> — every state is UNKNOWN, never "absent".` | 17 | refusal |
| `adr resolve: cannot enumerate open pull requests in <repo>: <reason> — "absent" is indistinguishable from "in-flight", so it is UNKNOWN.` | 18 | refusal |

**Scope** — every `NNNN-slug.md` under `--dir` at the fetched `--base`, plus every open pull request
in `--repo` that adds an `NNNN-*.md` file under that directory. Zero records is a fact and answers
`absent` for every id no open pull request holds, for the same reason it answers in `adr next`. The scope line
goes to stderr, naming the base SHA and both counts.

$ fabrika adr resolve 9164 --base origin/nonexistent
adr resolve: cannot fetch origin/nonexistent: couldn't find remote ref — every state is UNKNOWN, never "absent".
$ echo $?
17
```

**Grounding**

- **A citation to an unlanded record passes every gate.** A pull request has cited a record that
  never merged, and nothing caught it, so `in-flight` is a distinct state precisely to let a caller
  refuse to cite it.
- **A stale tree must exit `17`, never print `absent`.** A review gate reading a stale checkout has
  declared a merged record nonexistent; the fetch failing is UNKNOWN, not an answer.
- **A withdrawn record must read as withdrawn at the moment of citation.** A stale checkout has
  applied a record more than an hour after its withdrawal landed, so the `detail` field carries the
  frontmatter `status:` verbatim rather than a derived summary.
- **A guessed slug is a dead link.** A slug is not derivable from a title — the two diverge as soon
  as anyone edits either — so this verb prints the real filename and the caller uses it verbatim.
- **Zero scope reds for a gate; this verb is not one** — see `adr next`'s Grounding.

## `adr supersede` and `adr amend-in-part`

One mechanic, two relationships. Both rewrite the **frontmatter `status:` line of the older ADR and
nothing else**.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika adr supersede 9126 --by 9240 [--dir <path>]
```

```
fabrika adr amend-in-part 9023 --by 9240 [--dir <path>]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<id>` | positional string | yes | — | the four-digit id of the older ADR whose status line changes |
| `--by` | string | yes | — | the four-digit id of the ADR doing the superseding or amending |
| `--dir` | string | no | `decisionsDir`, else `.decisions` | the directory both records live in |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the edit record instead of the line grammar |

**Output** — one **tab-separated** line: the path edited, then the new `status:` value. With
`--json`, one object with keys `path`, `id`, `by`, `statusBefore`, `statusAfter`.

The written value resolves `--by`'s slug **off disk**, never from its title:

- `supersede` → `superseded by [NNNN](NNNN-slug.md)`, replacing whatever was there.
- `amend-in-part` → `amended-in-part by [NNNN](NNNN-slug.md)`. When the target already carries an
  `amended-in-part by` list, the new link is **appended** to it, comma-separated, in id order; a
  duplicate link is a no-op edit that still exits 0. A record amended by several later ones carries
  one link per amender, and a verb that overwrote instead of appending would silently drop every
  live relationship but the newest.

**The one-line invariant, enforced in code.** The verb reads the file, rewrites exactly the
`status:` line, and asserts before writing that the resulting text differs from the original on that
line alone. A diff of any other line is a bug and aborts the write with exit `15`. This assertion is
the deterministic test the implementation owes. The verb writes nothing beyond that line: the optional
bounded pointer [`SKILL.md` step 4](SKILL.md#4--resolve-every-reference-then-edit-the-status-lines)
allows is hand-added by the author, never by the verb.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | the status line was rewritten and the result is on stdout |
| `1` | usage error, or the verb failed to run |
| `7` | `<id>` has no record under `--dir` |
| `13` | `--by` has no record under `--dir` — the link would be dead on arrival |
| `14` | `<id>`'s frontmatter has no single rewritable `status:` line |
| `15` | the rewrite would have changed a line other than `status:` — aborted before writing |
| `16` | `<id>` is already `superseded by …`, so it is not amendable or re-supersedable |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `adr supersede: no record for id <id> under <dir>.` | 7 | refusal |
| `adr supersede: no record for --by id <by> under <dir> — refusing to write a dead link.` | 13 | refusal |
| `adr supersede: <path> has no single frontmatter status: line to rewrite.` | 14 | refusal |
| `adr supersede: rewrite would have changed <n> line(s) beyond status: — aborted, nothing written.` | 15 | refusal |
| `adr amend-in-part: <path> is already "superseded by …" — a superseded ADR is not amendable.` | 16 | refusal |

Each message is prefixed with the invoked verb name, so `adr amend-in-part` says `adr amend-in-part`.

**Scope** — not a judging verb. It reads and writes exactly one file, the record for `<id>`, and
reads one more, the record for `--by`, to resolve its slug.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika adr supersede 9126 --by 9240
docs/decisions/9126-one-record-per-decision.md	superseded by [9240](9240-only-landed-adrs-may-be-cited.md)
```

```
$ fabrika adr amend-in-part 9023 --by 9240
docs/decisions/9023-live-views-over-one-transport.md	amended-in-part by [9025](9025-split-the-connection-and-topic-roles.md), [9240](9240-only-landed-adrs-may-be-cited.md)
```

```
$ fabrika adr supersede 9126 --by 9999
adr supersede: no record for --by id 9999 under docs/decisions — refusing to write a dead link.
$ echo $?
13
```

**Grounding**

- **The dead link is the recurring FAIL here.** Resolving `--by`'s slug off disk, and refusing when
  it has no record, is why exit `13` exists.
- **The append case is real, not hypothetical.** Records carrying several `amended-in-part by` links
  at once are ordinary in a live corpus, so the list-append is the common path rather than an edge.
- Exit `15` makes the verb's own write mechanical rather than remembered: it rewrites the `status:`
  line and nothing else. What an author may still hand-add to the older record, the optional bounded
  pointer, is answered in [`SKILL.md` step 4](SKILL.md#4--resolve-every-reference-then-edit-the-status-lines).

## `adr sweep`

Ranks the uncited live-accepted ADRs whose decision domain the subject touches. **Implemented in
`fabrika`, calling nothing** — the lexical/rarity ranking is fabrika's own.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika adr sweep --new 9240 [--dir <path>] [--limit <n>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--new` | string | yes | — | the ADR to sweep: a four-digit id already in `--dir`, or a path to the draft file |
| `--dir` | string | no | `decisionsDir`, else `.decisions` | the corpus to sweep against |
| `--limit` | integer | no | `8` | how many shortlist entries to emit |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the sweep result as one JSON object on **stdout** |

**Ranking** — the score is a computation, and this is it. Two implementers who read this section
compute the same number to the last printed digit; nothing below is left to judgment.

1. **The corpus and the two populations.** Every `NNNN-slug.md` file under `--dir` is read, and that
   count is `scanned`. The **live-accepted corpus** `L` is every scanned record whose frontmatter
   `status:` is live (`accepted` or `amended-in-part …`, per the shared conventions), minus the
   subject's own record when the subject sits in `--dir`. `N = |L|`. The **in-scope** set is `L`
   minus every record whose id the subject already cites, a citation being any four-digit token
   anywhere in the subject's file text. `L` is the rarity denominator **and** the population the
   rarity floor of 10 counts — the whole live-accepted corpus, *before* citations are excluded. The
   in-scope set is only what gets ranked, and it is what `inScope` reports.
2. **Decision-bearing text**, taken the same way for the subject and for each record in `L`: the
   frontmatter `title:`, the `**What this decides:**` gloss up to its first blank line, and the
   `## Decision` section — frontmatter stripped, and nothing from `## Context` or `## Consequences`.
   Those two narrate why a decision was taken and what it costs; two ADRs contradict each other in
   what they *decide*, so ranking on decision text is what stops a shared war story scoring as a
   shared ruling. A record with no `## Decision` heading contributes its whole body instead, so a
   nonstandard record is rankable rather than silently invisible.
3. **Tokenizer.** Lowercase the text, split it on every run of characters outside `[a-z0-9]`, and
   keep the tokens of length ≥ 3 that are neither purely numeric (a bare number is an id, not a
   term) nor a stopword. Each document's terms are a **set**: a term counts once per record however
   often it occurs, so the score carries no term-frequency component.
4. **Stopwords** — exactly this list, and nothing domain-specific. Repo jargon needs no list: a term
   every record uses has a rarity weight near zero and contributes nothing on its own.

   ```

5. **Rarity.** `df(t)` is how many records of `L` carry term `t`. For each subject term `t` with
   `df(t) < N`, the weight is `idf(t) = ln(N / max(df(t), 1))`. A term with `df(t) = N` is dropped:
   carried by every record, it discriminates nothing. A term with `df(t) = 0` is kept at `ln(N)` —
   maximally rare, scoring against nobody, which is what separates the two silent outcomes below.
6. **Score.** Each in-scope record scores the sum of `idf(t)` over the subject terms it carries.
   A record scoring `0` is dropped rather than shortlisted at zero.
7. **Order and cut.** Descending score, ties broken by ascending numeric id; `--limit` then takes
   the first `n` of that order.
8. **Rounding.** A score is rounded to two decimals as `round(score × 100) / 100` (halves away from
   zero) and printed with exactly two decimals, so `2.3` prints `2.30`.

**This ratifies the shipped function rather than replacing it.**
[`packages/fabrika-cli/src/adr/sweep.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/adr/sweep.ts) already
computes exactly the above; the spec was unspecified and the implementation was not, so the
implementation is what got written down. Where the two ever disagree, this section is the contract
and the implementation is the bug.

**The three outcomes, disjoint by construction.**

- **`indeterminate`** — the run carries no information: either `N` is below the rarity floor of 10,
  or the subject yielded no distinctive term at all. **Distinctiveness is a property of the subject
  against the corpus, never of its overlap**: a subject term is distinctive when at least one record
  of `L` lacks it (`df(t) < N`). So a subject whose every term is *absent* from the corpus is
  maximally distinctive and never lands here — it reaches `no-overlap`.
- **`no-overlap`** — the subject had distinctive terms and no uncited live-accepted record shares
  one, so every in-scope record scored `0`. Never read as a clearance.
- **`shortlist`** — at least one in-scope record scored above `0`.

**Output** — the first line is the outcome token alone: `shortlist`, `no-overlap` or `indeterminate`.
On `shortlist`, one tab-separated line per entry follows — `<id>`, `<score>`, `<file>`, `<title>`.
The reason for a `no-overlap` or `indeterminate`, and the scope line, go to stderr.

**All three outcomes are answers, and all three exit 0.** The outcome is this verb's own verdict, and
a caller must never read its own shortlist as a failed run — which is precisely the mistake the
retired v1 sweep made by exiting `1` on the one case it was asked to produce.

With `--json`, one object on stdout with keys `outcome` (the token), `entries` (an array of
`{id, score, file, title}`, empty unless `outcome` is `shortlist`), `reason` (the string below, or
`null`), `scanned`, `inScope` and `cited`.

**The `reason` string is fixed text, byte for byte** — a caller may grep it, so it is pinned to the
same precision as every stderr message in the Errors table. `<N>` is the live-accepted count.

| Outcome | `reason` |
|---|---|
| `indeterminate`, below the floor | `the live-accepted corpus holds <N> record(s), below the rarity floor of 10 — every term looks common, so a clean sweep here is degenerate rather than clean` |
| `indeterminate`, no distinctive terms | `the subject yielded no distinctive terms against the live-accepted corpus — nothing to rank, so the run carries no information` |
| `no-overlap` | `no uncited live-accepted record shares a distinctive term with the subject — this is not a clearance: an ADR that disagrees about what a label means shares no vocabulary and never appears here` |
| `shortlist` | `null` |

The same sentence is what reaches stderr on either channel, as `adr sweep: <reason>.` — the verb's
prefix and a terminating period, and no other rewording.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | an outcome token was produced on stdout |
| `1` | usage error, or the verb failed to run |
| `7` | `--new` names an id or path with no readable ADR |
| `11` | the corpus could not be read, so the outcome is UNKNOWN |

`5` is vacated here for the group-wide reason above; no verb re-seats it.

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `adr sweep: cannot read <dir>: <reason> — the outcome is UNKNOWN, never "no-overlap".` | 11 | refusal |
| `adr sweep: no readable ADR for --new <value>.` | 7 | refusal |

**Scope** — every live-accepted record under `--dir` that `--new` does not already cite. The scope
line goes to stderr naming the corpus size and the in-scope count, because the outcome is only
readable against them: `indeterminate` fires when the live-accepted corpus is below the rarity floor
of 10 — the floor counts that corpus, not the in-scope subset — and a caller that cannot see the
count cannot tell that from a clean sweep.

**A readable-but-empty `--dir` is that floor at its limit and answers `indeterminate`**, with the
below-the-floor `reason` reading `0 record(s)`. It needs no case of its own: a corpus of nothing
carries no information for the same reason a corpus of three does not. Only a corpus that could not
be read is UNKNOWN, and that is exit `11`. Note `--new` still has to name a readable ADR — against an
empty `--dir` an `NNNN` id form resolves to nothing and refuses `7`, so a fresh adopter passes the
path to their draft.

**Examples**

A score is relative to the corpus it was computed against, so an example that prints one names a
**committed** corpus rather than the repo's live one, whose scores would be stale the next time a
record lands: a spec's example value is derivable or it is absent.
Both examples run against fixtures in this skill's tree and reproduce byte for byte; the scope line
each writes to stderr is not shown.

```

$ echo $?
0
```

Four of that corpus's ten records — `0105`, `0106`, `0108`, `0109` — are absent, and the absence is
the ranking working: each shares exactly one term with the subject, `decision`, which all ten records
carry (`df = N`), so its weight is dropped and the record scores `0`. The tail is the arithmetic in
the open: `0107` shares only `time` and `0110` only `lands`, each held by one record of ten, so both
score `ln(10 / 1) = 2.302…` → `2.30` and tie, and the tie breaks toward the lower id.

```
$ fabrika adr sweep --new 0240 --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/adr/small-corpus
indeterminate
$ echo $?
0
```

That corpus holds three live-accepted records, so it is below the rarity floor and the run is
indeterminate rather than clean. With `--json` the same run carries the pinned `reason`:

```
$ fabrika adr sweep --new 0240 --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/adr/small-corpus --json
{"outcome":"indeterminate","entries":[],"reason":"the live-accepted corpus holds 3 record(s), below the rarity floor of 10 — every term looks common, so a clean sweep here is degenerate rather than clean","scanned":4,"inScope":3,"cited":0}
$ echo $?
0
```

**Grounding**

- **Zero scope reds for a gate; this verb is not one** — see `adr next`'s Grounding.
- **Two scars the retired v1 sweep carried, repeated here by neither.** It exited `1` whenever it
  *had* a shortlist, so a caller read its informative case as a failure, and its `--json` payload
  went to stderr leaving stdout empty. All three outcomes exit `0` here, and `--json` goes to stdout.
- **The ranking is written out step by step under Ranking above** — a lexical/rarity score over
  decision-bearing text, capped at 8, excluding the subject's own citations. A one-line gloss is not
  enough: it printed example scores nobody could re-derive from it.
- **An example value is derivable or it is absent**, and this verb's shipped ranking is ratified as
  the spec rather than restated beside it.
