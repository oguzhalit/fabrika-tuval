# `/heal-ci` — derived CLI contract

**Skill:** [`heal-ci`](SKILL.md) · **Date:** 2026-08-10

These verbs live in `packages/fabrika-cli/`, binary `fabrika`, grouped under a `heal-ci`
subcommand. (The skill directory and the CLI group are both `heal-ci`, so every invocation reads
as a sentence — `fabrika heal-ci diagnose 9412`. One skill, one group; the mapping is stated here
once. `review-ui` is the shipped precedent for a hyphenated group name.) At the time of writing
the sibling groups are `adr`, `build`, `epic`, `eval`, `grill`, `hook`, `ledger`, `map`, `plan`,
`report`, `review`, `review-ui`, `ship`, `spend`, `status`, `triage`, `ui` and `wire` — though
that list grows most weeks, so read
[`src/registry.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/registry.ts) rather than this sentence.
The [CLI interface convention](../../docs/cli-interface-convention.md) governs these verbs; where
this spec and that doc disagree, the doc wins and this spec is the bug.

**`fabrika` calls the predecessor `pipeline-cli` nowhere, and neither does the skill** — fabrika
reimplements what it replaces and never invokes it. Every verb below is implemented from scratch.
The predecessor `heal-ci` (392 lines, 10 scripts) and the nine `pipeline-cli` tools it replaces were
read for their semantics and their scars — each Grounding section names what the v1 counterpart gets
wrong and what this spec does instead — but no clause defers to one, and none is invoked.

**Substrate.** Effect CLI verbs on the `@effect/platform-node` seam the sibling groups use.
GitHub access is `gh api` REST throughout, per
[the skill conventions' "GitHub access is REST, never GraphQL"](../../docs/skill-conventions.md) —
**this group takes no GraphQL carve and no porcelain carve.** Every read specified below has a
REST form, because the one read that does not — review-thread **resolution** state, whose
`isResolved` lives only on GraphQL `reviewThreads` — is specified out of this group's scope rather
than carved for (see the out-of-scope entry below and arm 7 of `diagnose`). `ship`'s two carves
(review-thread resolution; auto-merge arming) therefore stay `ship`'s. Named because a spec that
leaves the substrate open makes the implementer guess.

## Verb inventory

| Verb | Purpose | Split test |
|---|---|---|
| `heal-ci diagnose` | one PR's stall class from the ordered, total predicate chain, with the evidence that proves it | the chain is a transcription of a fixed precedence table over read facts; what to do about a class is judgment |
| `heal-ci sweep` | every open PR classified with its strand age — the scheduled surface | enumeration, per-PR classification and dwell arithmetic are mechanical; which strand to work first is judgment |
| `heal-ci surface` | declared required contexts against the runs that actually post at the head | comparing two enumerated sets is mechanical; changing repository settings is a human's act |
| `heal-ci logs` | the failed-job log text for **every** failing gating context at a head | run resolution, job selection and byte-bounding are mechanical; reading the failure is judgment |
| `heal-ci classify` | **pure**: log text on stdin → one signature from a closed taxonomy, default-deny | a fixed pattern table over text, no network and no state; there is no judgment in a table lookup |
| `heal-ci rerun` | the at-most-once transient rerun, precondition re-derived inside the verb, read-back verified | the guard, the write and the proof are mechanical; whether a transient is worth rerunning at all is judgment |
| `heal-ci note` | the durable stop-path comment, suppressed per `<pr>:<class>:<head>` | posting with the sibling groups' write protocol, and reading the key back over the whole history, are mechanical; what the note says is the skill's |
| `heal-ci scratch` | the per-lane path a healer's note bodies go under | naming a directory from a session id and a PR number is mechanical; what goes in it is the skill's |

### Considered and deliberately not derived

Each is a real proposal someone could make again. (Conventions §7 homes these in a plugin-root
`.out-of-scope/`, which no fabrika skill has bootstrapped yet; until it exists they live inline,
the same tracked debt the sibling contracts carry.)

- **A second answer to any CI-enforced question.** The repo's own always-on required status context
  is the one the merge queue awaits on the `merge_group` ref, and its leak and secret-scanning
  workflows gate landed content. A fabrika copy of any of these could only agree redundantly or
  contradict an enforced verdict. Every verb here reads those gates' **results**; none recomputes
  their judgment.
- **A gate verdict of any kind, or a route standing in for one.** This skill is explicitly outside
  the SHA-bound verdict contract, so no verb emits a verdict marker or a `routed-elsewhere`
  record — it reads both and writes neither — and this spec requests **no widening** of
  `NAMESPACE` / `NAMESPACE_PREFIXES` in
  [`wire/verdict-marker.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/verdict-marker.ts) or of
  `SHIP_NAMESPACES` in
  [`review/classes.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/classes.ts). `heal-ci` is not a
  member of those closed sets today and does not need to be. A later session reaching for the
  widening should read this bullet first.
- **A merge-blocking check, a required context, or anything that can red a PR.** The explicit
  no-go. Every artifact this group produces is a comment, a filed issue,
  or a rerun request.
- **A wedge-clearing verb** (cancel the stranded check, re-run it). The lever mutates CI runs this
  lane does not own, and a bounded run cannot supervise the retry it triggers — both halves of the
  ruling that settled it. `diagnose` reports `wedged` and names the contexts; the lever is an
  operator's to pull.
- **A check-surface *repair* verb** (arm, rename or disarm a required context). That is a
  repository-settings mutation with a human's name on it, and arming a required check wrong has cost
  a whole wedged merge queue. `surface` diagnoses and stops.
- **A conflict-clearing verb** (rebase, merge the base in, force-push). `diagnose` classifies a
  conflicted PR as `conflicted` and arrows it at `build` — or at `author`, on a PR the pipeline
  does not own — and that is the whole move: clearing the
  conflict is a branch mutation, and this group owns no branch and checks out nothing.
- **A dispatch or adoption verb.** A detector converts a strand into claimable work; an engine
  never free-scan-adopts, so no verb here assigns, claims, or spawns a lane and `sweep` writes
  nothing at all.
- **A tracking-issue minter for an unlinked PR.** A conversation-authored doc or ADR PR may
  legitimately carry no linked issue, and minting one to satisfy a link guard is banned outright.
  `diagnose` reads linkage as a fact, never as a requirement.
- **A new issue-reference token.** `linkage-refused` names the state; it proposes no grammar.
  Triage ruled the fix is widening what `Part of #N` is stated to cover, and that `Re: #N`,
  `Refs`, `See` and a bare `#N` stay banned everywhere.
- **A recurrence / flaky-signature ledger.** "This signature has failed six times this week" is a
  scheduled, cross-run concern with its own storage question; this group answers about one head.
  `sweep` is a stateless re-scan, not a history.
- **A local reproduction, install, build or test run.** §RO in the skill. Three separate incidents
  had the healing action turn out to be the damage.
- **An agent-honoured hold.** A hold is label-triggered and platform-enforced and cause-agnostic; a
  shipper- or healer-read label is the losing side of that fork.
- **Detecting a PR blocked *solely* by an unresolved human review thread.** Resolution state is
  GraphQL-only (`reviewThreads.isResolved`; REST `pulls/{n}/comments` carries no resolved flag), so
  reading it would need this group's own GraphQL carve. The ruling was to narrow the axis and keep
  the no-carve substrate. `diagnose` arm 7 therefore fires on REST-derivable human blocks
  only — a live `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review at the head, or a control-plane diff with no approval at
  the head — and a PR whose *only* block is an open human thread reads as some other class. The door
  stays open: if a real stranded PR is ever blocked solely that way, the narrow read-only
  `reviewThreads` carve gets added then, with `ship`'s shipped precedent to copy.

### Filing is the `report` group's, reused rather than respecified

The skill's `FILED — #N` terminal and its `unclassified` route both end at the intake seam, and
this group specifies **no filing verb**. The write is `fabrika report file`'s, in the landed
sibling group, whose contract owns its flags, its six-section body shape, its leak refusals and
its exit codes — the cross-contract reuse `build-ui` established for `build`'s lane mechanics.
Two consequences the implementer needs: the issue number the `FILED — #N` terminal carries is the
one `report file` prints on stdout, read from there and never composed by hand; and `report`'s
exit codes stay `report`'s, so a filing refusal is reported in that group's vocabulary rather than
translated into this one's. This group allocates no seat for a filing outcome, which is why `4`
remains a deliberate gap here.

### Nothing here recomputes an enforced answer

Every question this group answers is ungated today: stall classification, strand age,
required-context-versus-producing-run coverage, failure-signature classification, rerun
eligibility. The enforced ones are named above with the workflow that owns each, and this spec
computes no second verdict on any of them.

### The name and routing situation

At authoring time the predecessor `heal-ci` was still a live project-level skill under its own
plugin, so the name resolved ambiguously while both existed. The cutover has since happened: that
plugin tree is deleted, `heal-ci` resolves uniquely to this skill, and it is reached as
`/fabrika:heal-ci`.

This spec closes the counterpart gap `ship`'s contract records: *"the skill routes red CI to
`heal-ci`, and no fabrika counterpart exists yet"*. Once these verbs are implemented, `ship checks`
→ `red` has a fabrika lane to route to. That is one entry door of several — the sweep and a bare
`heal #N` are the others, and the green-strand classes are reachable through neither `ship` nor CI.

## Shared conventions

Stated once rather than repeated per block.

- **Answer channel: machine.** Stdout carries the answer and nothing else; scope lines, refusal
  reasons, progress and notices go to stderr. **Every "nothing found" case prints a state word** —
  empty stdout is byte-identical to a verb that never ran. v1 broke this in seven of ten scripts,
  printing English diagnostics onto the same stream as the machine answer, and in one case
  interleaving prose *into the log body* a caller was pattern-matching for signatures.
  **One outcome convention for the whole group:** exit `0` means "I produced the answer", whatever
  the answer is — `red`, `wedged`, `no-requirements` and `unclassified` are answers; non-zero
  means "I could not produce one", plus the enumerated proven refusals of the write verbs.
  v1's green head exited `3`, making its most successful outcome a failure to every caller using
  the toolkit's own `|| exit 1` idiom.
- **Common inputs.** `--repo <owner/name>` (default: `$CLAUDE_PIPELINE_REPO`, else
  `$GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, else the `origin` remote; none resolvable → exit `1` — the resolution chain
  the shipped `report`/`triage`/`review`/`ship` groups use, inherited for one config surface rather
  than a second vocabulary). `--json` swaps the line grammar for one object with the named keys.
  **Every GitHub call carries the resolved repo explicitly.** v1's three `gh run` calls omitted it,
  so a run id from one repository silently resolved in another — a misclassification, not an error.
- **Every `<sha>` a verb PRINTS is the resolved 40-hex head**, never the abbreviation the caller
  passed — a caller that cannot tell an echoed flag from a resolved head cannot bind anything to
  the answer. Examples below abbreviate for readability and say so at their first use.
- **`--sha` binds the answer to what the caller verified.** Verbs taking `--sha` accept 7–40
  lowercase hex and **prefix-match it against the live head using the shipped `prefixMatch`
  helper** ([`ship/target.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/ship/target.ts)) — import it.
  Read verbs report a mismatch as a stderr notice and still answer at the given SHA; the write verb
  refuses `12`. An empty or malformed `--sha` is a usage error, never a matches-everything pattern.
  v1 compared heads with the shell glob `case "$CURRENT_HEAD" in "$RSHA"*)`, which binds a
  truncated review commit to a head it does not equal, and which collapses to `*` on an empty
  capture.
- **Every list read paginates, reports its scanned count on stderr, and carries a completeness
  proof.** Where the platform declares a total (check runs, workflow runs, issue comments, jobs),
  received-short-of-declared is the `13` refusal. Where it declares none (the PR timeline, the
  open-PR list), the proof is a **terminal page carrying no `rel="next"` link**, and a read that
  ends without one is the same `13` refusal; those reads walk pages explicitly and read the `Link`
  header rather than using `--paginate`, which concatenates bodies and drops the headers the proof
  lives in. Any aggregate is computed **after** the pages are joined.
  This is the single highest-value scar in the v1 corpus: its rerun-marker count read only the
  first page at the default `per_page=30`, so on a PR with more than thirty comments the marker was
  invisible, `rerun-markers=0` read as "not yet rerun", and the one-rerun rule silently became an
  **unbounded rerun loop on exactly the most-repaired PRs**. Its round counter had the same hole at
  100, in the opposite direction: an under-count kept `ROUNDS < 3` forever and suppressed the
  defect filing permanently.
- **A failed read is never detected by testing emptiness.** `gh` writes its error document to
  **stdout** when a request fails, so a captured variable is non-empty and an `[ -n "$X" ]` guard
  can never fire on the failure it names. Every capture checks the process exit status before the
  bytes are interpreted; a failed read is `11`. v1 shipped that dead guard in four places, each
  under a comment asserting the opposite, and its own shared library documents the mechanism.
- **A non-zero exit is UNKNOWN**, and carries no answer: `refuse()` in
  [`verb.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/verb.ts) hardcodes empty stdout, which is why
  every classification in this group is an exit-`0` answer token rather than an exit code. No verb
  substitutes a fabricated value for an unreadable one.
- **Proven-absent and could-not-read never share a code.** `7` is a fact about the repository (a
  404); `11` is the absence of a fact. This group leans on it hard because v1's worst behaviours
  are its collapse: a failed collaborator-permission probe read as "not authorized" (silently
  under-counting repair rounds), a decode failure read as "this PR has no lane" — a reading that
  then **authorized filing an issue** — and a failed staged-deletion probe read as "zero deletions".
- **Reads read; writes write.** No read verb posts a comment or mutates anything. Every write verb
  re-reads its target and verifies. v1 trusted its rerun dispatch (a 2xx taken as proof a new
  attempt exists, then a durable marker written that blocks every future rerun) and discarded both
  comment-creation responses to `/dev/null`.
- **`--json` shapes are normative as key lists.** The line-grammar examples are the byte-level
  contract; each verb's `--json` object mirrors the lines one-for-one. One canonical worked example
  lives on `heal-ci diagnose`; the rest are key lists, deliberately.

### Usage errors: one formatter, one shape, exit `1`

Every verb refuses a malformed invocation through **one shared formatter**, so the spec does not
carry a near-identical row per flag per verb. Its output is exactly:

```
fabrika heal-ci <verb>: <what> — <why>.
usage: fabrika heal-ci <verb> <the verb's Invocation line, verbatim>
```

Both lines go to **stderr**, stdout stays empty, and the exit is `1` (rule 3's usage seat). The
reachable cases and their `<what> — <why>` text, which is the part an implementer must not invent:

| Case | `<what> — <why>` |
|---|---|
| a positional that is not a positive integer | `"<v>" is not a pull-request number — expected a positive integer` |
| `--sha` empty, or not 7–40 lowercase hex | `--sha "<v>" is not 7-40 lowercase hex — an empty or malformed sha is never a wildcard` |
| `--repo` given but not `owner/name` | `--repo "<v>" is not in owner/name form` |
| `--repo` absent and unresolvable from the environment | `no repository resolved — pass --repo, or set CLAUDE_PIPELINE_REPO or GITHUB_REPOSITORY, or run inside a checkout with an origin remote` |
| any integer flag non-numeric or negative | `--<flag> "<v>" is not a non-negative integer` |
| an operand the verb never declared | `unexpected operand "<v>"` |

The `--sha` row is the one with a scar behind it: v1 matched heads with a shell glob that collapsed
to "matches everything" on an empty capture, so an unset variable silently bound every head. Here an
empty `--sha` cannot reach the matching logic at all.

### The shared exit taxonomy

All eight verbs allocate from one internal table, so a code means one thing across this group.
The `3`–`11` seats are **imported from
[`report/codes.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/codes.ts)** and `12`/`13` from
[`review/codes.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/codes.ts) — the import-not-restate
idiom `ship/codes.ts` already ships — never re-typed as numerals and never read off a sibling
`contract.md`, because the checked-in `/report` contract is behind its own binary on `7` and `11`.

| Code | Meaning | Verbs that can return it |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | the answer is on stdout — including `red`, `wedged`, `unclassified`, `no-requirements`: answers, not errors | all |
| `1` | usage error, unresolvable repo, or the verb failed to run | all |
| `2` | no implementation could be resolved | all |
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing | `classify`, `note` |
| `4` | *(deliberate gap — `report file`'s body-section seat; no verb here composes sections)* | — |
| `5` | the **authored** text carries a machine-local path | `note` |
| `6` | the **authored** text is a bare `@` path reference — not redactable | `note` |
| `7` | zero scope: the target is **proven absent (404)**, or a required input is proven empty where emptiness is not a fact — a fail-closed refusal | `diagnose`, `surface`, `logs`, `rerun`, `note` |
| `8` | the write, or the read that confirms it, failed — the outcome is **UNKNOWN** | `rerun`, `note` |
| `9` | the write landed but the read-back does not match | `rerun`, `note` |
| `10` | a supplied value is off a closed vocabulary — an unknown `--signature`, an unknown `--class`, a malformed `--slug` | `rerun`, `note`, `scratch` |
| `11` | a **precondition read failed** — nothing was proven and (for a write) nothing was written | all except `classify` and `scratch`, neither of which reads a precondition |
| `12` | refused: the live head moved past the inspected `--sha` — a mutation formed over a tree that is no longer the PR | `rerun` |
| `13` | refused: a read completed but its scope is **provably incomplete** — received short of a declared count, or (where the platform declares none) pagination never reached a terminal page | `diagnose`, `sweep`, `surface`, `logs`, `rerun`, `note` |
| `14` | refused: **proven not in the state this write acts on** — nothing was mutated | `rerun`, `note` |
| `15` | refused: the run's logs are **proven unavailable** (expired or purged by the platform) — a fact about the run, not a failed read | `logs` |
| `16` | the rerun **provably landed** and its durable marker could not be written — the record, not the rerun, is missing | `rerun` |
| `127` | the verb never ran (unresolved binary) | all |

**This matrix owns what a code *means*; the per-verb tables own what *triggers* it.** Every verb
can return `0`, `1`, `2` and `127` with the meanings above, stated here and nowhere else; the
per-verb "Exit status" tables enumerate only that verb's own proven outcomes, `3` and up, phrased
as that verb's trigger.

**`16` is the loudest code in the group, and it exists because the rerun is the one two-legged
mutation here.** A new attempt is confirmed and the marker that would stop the *next* session
spending a second rerun did not land — so the invariant is live but unrecorded, and the next reader
sees a head that looks un-rerun. Folding that into `8` would hide the one fact an operator must act
on immediately, which is the same reasoning `ship nudge` seats its own `17` on.

**`14` and `15` are this group's own proven refusals.** `14` is the write-side state guard, and both
write verbs seat on it: a rerun aimed at a head that was already rerun, at a run that is not failed,
or at a closed PR, and a note whose `<pr>:<class>:<head>` key the PR already carries. Each is a state
the verb proved and declined on, which is neither `7` (the target exists) nor `11` (nothing failed) —
and both are refusals that are *successes*, since nothing was mutated. It is v1's most important scar
made structural, and §S19 below is why it must live in the verb rather than in the caller: the note's
copy of the guard lived in a workflow's `run:` block and covered exactly that one caller.
`15` exists because "GitHub has expired these logs" is a *verdict* about a run — permanent,
actionable, and a different remedy from a transport failure — and folding it into `11` would tell
the caller to retry a read that can never succeed.

**Cross-group note.** `14` and `15` mean something different here than `ship`'s `16`/`17` or
`review`'s `14`/`15`. That is the doctrine, not a collision: the `3`+ band is scoped to the group
that seats it, the alignment check runs each group against the **base** (`report`) and never
pairwise against a sibling, and every invocation names its group. `wire` is the shipped
counter-example that makes this explicit.

**Registering the group's table is part of implementing it.** The seats above live in
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/heal-ci/codes.ts`, and that module must additionally be registered in
[`exit-code-alignment.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/exit-code-alignment.ts) as an
**aligned** group, with its `SharedSeats` map declaring `4` as a deliberate gap and naming the
seats it takes on the base's numbers. `coverageGaps()` reds on any group `registry.ts` registers
that it cannot classify as base / aligned / unaligned / untabled, so a group that ships a table
without this row fails the alignment guard the moment it is registered — and the guard's row must
land in the same change as the registry row, never after it.

### Read-backs compare normalized text, not bytes

Every write verb re-reads its target and compares through **`normalizeForReadback` from
[`report/compose.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/compose.ts)** — import it; its
third step (strip trailing newlines) is the one a re-derivation drops, and dropping it fires exit
`9` on clean runs.

### Machine-local path detection

`heal-ci note` shares the leak predicate **already implemented** at
[`report/leaks.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/leaks.ts) — import it, never
re-derive it. This is the authored-text guard only; scanning *landed* content is the enforced seam
of the repo's own leak workflow.

### The note suppression key is a specified format too

`heal-ci note` reads a marker the same verb writes, so the format is stated here for the same reason
the rerun marker's is. The marker is **one whole line** of the posted comment, and it is composed by
the verb from `--class`, `--sha` and the PR number — never authored by a caller:

```
<!-- heal-ci-note key=<pr>:<stall-class>:<40-hex head sha> -->
```

The detection read matches that **whole line, anywhere in the body**, with the head compared as full
40-hex equality — never a prefix, and never a substring of the body. Whole-line-anywhere rather than
first-line-only because the note's first line is the skill's fixed
`heal-ci: <terminal> — PR #<n> @ <sha> → <lane>` signal line, which every receiver parses; the machine
marker rides below it rather than displacing it. Whole-line rather than substring because a substring
search matches the key quoted inside a human's reply, and suppressing on somebody's quotation is how
a real strand goes unrecorded.

**It cannot overlap the rerun marker's format, in either direction**, and a test asserts both
readings: an HTML comment is not a `heal-ci-rerun:` first line, and a `RERUN-QUEUED` note — which
carries this key and names the same head at the same moment — is not read as the at-most-once rerun
marker. The reader and writer live in `packages/fabrika-cli/src/heal-ci/note-key.ts`, beside but not
inside `marker.ts`: two formats, two readers, no overlap.

### The rerun marker is a specified format, because two steps must agree on it

The at-most-once guard reads a marker that the same verb writes, so an unstated format lets an
implementer ship a writer its own reader cannot match. `heal-ci rerun`'s marker is a comment whose
**first line is exactly**:

```
heal-ci-rerun: <40-hex head sha> <run-id> <signature-id>
```

The detection read in guard step 3 matches **that first line only**, anchored, with the head
compared as a full 40-hex equality — never a prefix, and never a substring search of the body.
This is deliberately **not** the `heal-ci: <terminal> — PR #<n> @ <sha> …` shape `heal-ci note`
writes: a `note` recording a `RERUN-QUEUED` terminal names the same head at the same moment, so a
looser matcher would read the skill's own narration as the machine marker and refuse every first
rerun. Two formats, two readers, no overlap.

### Modules imported rather than re-derived

This group computes a new answer over facts the package already reads. Every module below is
imported; a second copy is the drift this section exists to prevent.

| Module | Used for |
|---|---|
| `review/rollup.ts` — `rollupOf`, `statusOf`, `isFailing`, `isStalled` | the check-run rollup and half the wedge test |
| `review/blocking.ts` — `readBlockingSet`, `authorityNote`, `reportedLine`, `unreadableCause` | which contexts may block: the base branch's declared required set, with the denylist as the undeclared-branch fallback |
| `review/classes.ts` — `SHIP_NAMESPACES`, `touchesGovernanceRoot` | which namespaces a diff requires a verdict in |
| `wire/verdict-marker.ts` — `read`, `bindToHead` | reading whether a verdict exists at the head. **Read only — this group emits none.** |
| `wire/routed-elsewhere.ts` — `read` | reading the head-bound record that says a gate owes this PR no verdict. **Read only — this group emits none.** |
| `ship/gate-verb.ts` — `inForce`, `ROUTABLE` | head-bound-first, write-stamp-ordered verdict resolution, and the one namespace a route may resolve |
| `ship/queue.ts` — `queueStateOf`, `landedOnBase` | merge-queue entry state off the timeline, with the paired-removal rule |
| `ship/github.ts` — `listShipCheckRuns`, `listRunsAtHead`, `listWorkflows`, `pullTimeline`, `behindBase`, `readMergeability` | the head-bound REST reads |
| `ship/target.ts` — `prefixMatch`, `badNumber`, `scannedLine` | argument guards and SHA matching |
| `io/pulls.ts` — `getPullRequest`, `listPullFiles`, `permissionFor` | PR metadata and the ACL leg |
| `review/head.ts` — `bindHead` | tying a read to one commit before the read |

**Two reads are genuinely new IO and exist nowhere in the package**: fetching a workflow job's log
text, and requesting a rerun. Both are specified from scratch below.

`stall\t<token>\t<head-sha>\t<age-minutes>` where `<token>` is exactly one of `attended`,
`ungated`, `gated-unshipped`, `claim-stale`, `red`, `check-surface`, `conflicted`,
`linkage-refused`, `blocked-human`, `wedged`, `not-open`, and `<age-minutes>` is the strand age (see
below). Then one
line per evidence fact, in this fixed order, each present always:

```
owner	<login|->	<claimed-at|->	<last-activity|->
author	<login|->	<ours|granted|foreign|unknown|unread>
gates	<satisfied|blocked|none-required>	<pass-count>/<required-count>
ci	<green|red|pending|wedged|no-runs|none>	<failing-or-stranded-context-count>

queue	<queued|armed|none>
link	<fixes:<n>|part-of:<n>|other|none>
facts	scanned-comments:<n>	scanned-checks:<n>	behind-base:<k>
```

With `--json`:
`{"outcome":"stall","token":…,"head":<40-hex>,"ageMinutes":<n>,"owner":{"login":…,"claimedAt":…,"lastActivityAt":…},"author":{"login":…,"standing":…},"gates":{"state":…,"pass":<n>,"required":<n>},"ci":{"rollup":…,"contexts":<n>},"queue":…,"link":{"kind":…,"number":<n|null>},"scanned":{"comments":<n>,"checks":<n>},"behindBase":<k>}`.

**The `author` line says whether the pipeline owns the PR.** A pull request belongs to its author.
It is the pipeline's when its author is in the repo's `ownAccounts` (the running, authenticated
account alone when that set is empty or absent) — `ours` — or when a
[`takeover-grant`](../../docs/wire-formats.md#takeover-grant) marker from an account in the
control-plane set stands on it — `granted`. Otherwise it is `foreign`, and the arrow a class would
point at `build` points at `author` instead. The standing is read only for a class whose work can
reach `build`: the arrow's two (`conflicted`, and `linkage-refused` with a holder) and `red`, whose
arrow is `nobody` but whose `logic` route (`SKILL.md` §3) names `build` only on `ours` or `granted`.
Every other class prints `unread`. A standing that cannot be
read — a GitHub App token cannot name its own account, for one — prints `unknown` with a stderr
notice: the class is still proven, so it is not a refusal, and an unknown standing never reaches
`build`.

**The `ci` line's two zero-signal tokens are distinct facts, not synonyms.** `none` means the
repository has **zero active workflows** — there is no CI here at all, the foreign-repo case the
Required-repo-files table degrades on. `no-runs` means workflows exist and **none fired at this
head** — the dropped-trigger state, which is a defect in the trigger and not an absence of CI.
Collapsing them would tell an adopter with no CI to go chase a dropped trigger.

**The strand age** is minutes between **the later of the head commit's push time and the PR's last
activity** and the local clock at read time, floored at `0`. Both operands go to stderr. It is the
number the sweep orders on, so it is derived here once rather than in two places.

**The classification is an ordered, total predicate chain. First match wins**, and the order is
the contract — two implementers walking it in a different order produce different answers on the
same PR, which is exactly the drift a prose taxonomy invites.

The chain has two phases, and the split is what makes totality provable. **Arms 1–7 are
attention-independent**: they name states that block the PR no matter who is watching, so they are
tested before anyone asks whether somebody is on it. **Arms 8–11 are the attendance phase**: the
PR is open and otherwise able to proceed, so the only remaining question is whether anybody is
moving it.

| # | Token | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `not-open` | the PR's state is `draft`, `closed` or `merged`. An answer, not a refusal |
| 2 | `wedged` | ≥1 **blocking** check run is `queued` with a null `started_at` past `--wedge-dwell-minutes` (`isStalled`, plus the dwell) |
| 3 | `conflicted` | the merge of this head into its base conflicts — `mergeable_state` is `dirty` on a definite read. An **indefinite** read skips this arm rather than firing it |
| 4 | `check-surface` | ≥1 declared required status context has **no producing run** at this head, or ≥1 gating run answers no declared requirement — `surface`'s exact predicate, shared as one module so the two verbs cannot disagree |
| 5 | `red` | the blocking rollup at the head is `red` (`rollupOf` over `listShipCheckRuns`, narrowed to the base branch's declared required set first — `review/blocking.ts`) |
| 6 | `linkage-refused` | the diff derives ≥1 namespace whose merge seam requires a linked issue, the body carries neither `Fixes #N` nor `Part of #N`, **and** it carries some other reference form |
| 7 | `blocked-human` | ≥1 non-`Bot` reviewer's latest decisive review at this head is `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, or the diff touches a control-plane path and no approval stands at this head. REST-derivable signals only — the unresolved-thread axis is out of scope, above |
| 8 | `attended` | **any positive signal of motion**: an owner whose last activity is inside `--dwell-minutes`, a live merge-queue entry, an armed merge intent, or a blocking rollup of `pending` — CI running at this head *is* the PR moving |
| 9 | `claim-stale` | an owner signal exists and arm 8 did not fire — the claim is there and nothing shows it live. The stderr notice names which of the three proved it: activity older than `--dwell-minutes`, a head more than `--drift-commits` behind the base (`behindBase`), or an activity timestamp that could not be read at all |
| 10 | `gated-unshipped` | no owner signal, and every required namespace is filled at this head (`inForce`) — an in-force `pass` verdict, or for `review-ui` alone a head-bound `routed-elsewhere` record saying the gate owes this PR no verdict |
| 11 | `ungated` | no owner signal, and ≥1 required namespace holds neither at this head |

**Arm 3 fires above arm 4 deliberately, and it is what keeps arm 4 honest.** GitHub builds no
`refs/pull/<n>/merge` for a conflicted PR, so no `pull_request` workflow ever fires and **every**
required context reads absent — which is arm 4's exact predicate. Classified there, a conflicted PR
becomes a repository-settings escalation with an operator's name on it, and the repair it actually
needs is a rebase. Arm 3 is therefore read **before** the surface is consulted at all, and it is the
one arm whose fact comes from the pull request rather than from the check surface.

**An indefinite mergeability skips arm 3; it never fires it.** GitHub computes `mergeable` lazily,
so the first read of a pull request routinely answers `null` with `mergeable_state: "unknown"`. That
is the platform declining to answer: it is re-read across `--mergeability-seconds` through `ship`'s
own poll loop — one implementation, so the two verbs never answer differently about one PR — and a
value still indefinite at the end of that window **skips the arm** with a stderr notice, exactly as
the linkage arm skips a draft. Reading indefinite as conflicted would route a healthy PR to a
rebase nobody owes.

**The read is made only where arm 1 has not already taken the PR.** GitHub computes `mergeable` for
open pull requests, so a closed, merged or draft one stays indefinite however long it is polled: a
live run spent the whole 60-second window on a closed PR for a fact the chain then never consulted,
and a sweep pays that again for every PR that closed between its list read and its classification.
Arm 3 is skipped there on a fact nobody read, which is the same skip an indefinite value takes.

**Arm 4 fires above arm 5 deliberately.** A required context that no run produces cannot be healed
by anything a red-log classifier does, so a PR carrying both a config gap and a failing test is
reported `check-surface` first: the gap is the cause the other repair cannot reach.

**An unreadable required set stops the classification; it no longer skips one arm.** The base
branch's declared set is the blocking authority for arms 2, 4 and 5 alike (`review/blocking.ts`), so
where it is `unprobeable` (see `surface`) none of the three is derivable and the verb refuses on
`11` naming that read as the cause. A lane then waits or parks on the read failure rather than on a
check's colour, which is what it means for this definition to fail closed. Where the set reads fine
and names **nothing**, the informational-name denylist answers instead: an undeclared branch is one
nobody has said what gates, not one that gates nothing. A plan-gated base (see `surface`) takes the
denylist too, because its branch cannot declare a required check.

**A red outside the declared set is reported, never routed.** It is named on stderr as
reported-never-blocking and reaches no arm. Making it block means adding its context to the base
branch's ruleset, not a list in this repository.

**Arm 8 sits above arms 9–11, not below them.** An actively-worked PR is not stranded, and ranking
any strand class above `attended` would report a PR whose author pushed two minutes ago as
abandoned. `pending` belongs in arm 8 for the same reason: a run in flight is motion, not a stall.

**Totality, proved over all eleven arms.** Reaching arm 8 means the PR is open, not wedged, not
conflicted-or-skipped, surface-complete-or-skipped, not red, linkage-clean and human-unblocked, so its rollup is one of
`green`, `pending`, `no-runs` or `none`. Arm 8 takes every case carrying any positive signal —
`pending` included. What remains has no positive signal, and arms 9–11 partition it exhaustively on one Boolean:
**an owner signal either exists or it does not.** Where it exists, arm 9 takes it unconditionally —
arm 9 is the whole owner-exists complement of arm 8, not a subset of it, which matters because an
owner whose activity timestamp is *unreadable* is neither provably live nor provably old and must
still land somewhere. Reading unknown as stale is the fail-safe direction: a false strand costs one
look, a false `attended` is the incident. Where no owner signal exists, the required-namespace set
either holds an in-force verdict for every member (arm 10) or fails to for at least one (arm 11). A PR with **zero** required namespaces satisfies arm 10 vacuously and reads
`gated-unshipped` with `gates none-required` — correctly, since nothing gates it and nobody is
shipping it. No input reaches the end of the chain unclassified.

**Attendedness is never keyed on the linked issue's existence or state.** A stranded PR carried a
closing reference to a triaged, prioritised, milestoned and *assigned* issue and stranded exactly
like one with no board row at all. `link` is printed as a fact and consumed only by arm 6.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404), `--sha` names no commit on this PR, or the enumerated changed-file list is empty |
| `11` | the PR, its mergeability, its comments, its check runs, its verdicts, its timeline, its base, or its base branch's declared required set could not be read — the stall class is UNKNOWN, never `attended` |
| `13` | the comment, check-run or timeline enumeration is provably short of its declared count, the base branch's ruleset walk never reached a terminal page, the timeline read never reached a terminal page, or the changed-file list came back at GitHub's own 3000-file ceiling, where the Link header ends as a complete read ends. The changed-file list against the pull-request record's `changed_files` is **not** that proof and no longer refuses here |

**Scope** — one PR's metadata, mergeability, changed files, comments, check runs, workflow runs,
reviews and timeline, each paginated to exhaustion, plus its base branch's declared required
contexts. Every one
of those but the changed-file list is also count-checked: GitHub computes the pull-request record's
`changed_files` against a base it cached at the last push, so the file list is taken as the file set
and the disagreement is reported. An **empty** list still refuses — this is the verb an operator
reaches for when a PR is stuck, which is the worst place to keep a refusal a stuck PR can trigger.
So does a list at GitHub's own 3000-file ceiling: the endpoint stops serving files there and ends
its Link chain normally, so exhaustion cannot tell that read from a complete one.
Review *threads* are not read: arm 7 is REST-only, per the out-of-scope entry above. The predicate
chain is total over what was read; a read that could not complete is `11`, never a class.

**Examples**

(Examples abbreviate the head in prose fields for readability; a real run prints the resolved
40-hex head, as the `--json` example below shows.)

$ echo $?
7
```

**Grounding**

- `gated-unshipped`. A PR passed its gate and sat 35 minutes un-enqueued because the driver spawned
  a shipper for a different PR; nothing on the board could express it.
- `ungated`. Two PRs sat green and ungated for ~9 and ~10.5 hours on one day, both found by tracing
  a downstream hold backwards.
- `claim-stale`'s second arm. A PR was claimed while its mergeability read `null` and reviewed 14
  commits behind base; inactivity alone would not have caught it.
- Attendedness is not keyed on the linked issue, and a legitimately issueless PR is not a stall.
- Informational contexts are excluded before the rollup, so a preview-deploy red never reads as a
  healable stall of any kind.
- This verb reads verdict markers and emits none.
- v1's `resolve-failing-run.sh:43` exited `3` on a green head, so the healthiest outcome was a
  failure to any `|| exit 1` caller; here `attended` is an exit-`0` answer token.
- v1's `orphan-heal` tested CI-red at gate 2 and lane state at gate 3, so a green laneless PR was
  skipped `ci-not-red` and never reached the ownership question at all.

## `heal-ci sweep`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika heal-ci sweep [--min-age-minutes 30] [--limit 200] [--include-attended] [--dwell-minutes 45] [--wedge-dwell-minutes 20] [--drift-commits 10] [--mergeability-seconds 60] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--min-age-minutes` | integer | no | `30` | omit PRs whose strand age is below this; the grace window before a young PR counts as stranded |
| `--limit` | integer | no | `200` | the maximum number of open PRs to classify; a scan that would exceed it refuses `13` rather than answering over a subset |
| `--include-attended` | boolean | no | `false` | emit `attended` rows too, rather than only the stalled ones |
| `--dwell-minutes` | integer | no | `45` | passed through to each classification |
| `--wedge-dwell-minutes` | integer | no | `20` | passed through to each classification |
| `--drift-commits` | integer | no | `10` | passed through to each classification |
| `--mergeability-seconds` | integer | no | `60` | passed through to each classification; `0` reads mergeability once and never re-reads |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. First line: `swept\t<scanned>\t<stalled>` — both counts always, so
a zero-stall answer carries the scope it rests on rather than standing as a bare claim. Then one
line per emitted PR, **ordered by strand age descending**, ties broken by ascending PR number:

```
pr	<number>	<stall-token>	<age-minutes>	<head-sha>	<lane>
```

With `--json`: `{"outcome":"swept","scanned":<n>,"stalled":<n>,"prs":[{"number":<n>,"token":…,"ageMinutes":<n>,"head":…,"lane":…}…]}`.

**The lane is the note's arrow, looked up here rather than by the caller.** It is one of
`build`/`review`/`ship`/`author`/`human`/`nobody`, and it is a total function of the row's stall
class plus the owner and author this verb already read, and — for a class that would name `build` — the
PR's ownership standing, which turns `build` into `author` unless the PR is ours or granted.
`SKILL.md` §2 carries the table. A caller
composing a note's first line relays this column; deriving one in a workflow's `run:` block is the
shape a relaying script must never take, and hardcoding one tells every reader the detector found
nothing for anyone to do.

**This verb writes nothing.** It files no issue, assigns nobody, and spawns nothing — a detector
converts a strand into claimable work and normal pull adopts it.
v1's counterpart ran `--execute` on every scheduled invocation and POSTed issues against the live
board autonomously, keyed on a lane probe whose decode failure read as "laneless".

**Zero stalled rows at a proven non-zero `scanned` is an answer, not a refusal** — a quiet board
is the expected outcome most of the time, and refusing would red the schedule every calm night.
**Zero *scanned* is different and depends on proof:** a successful, terminal-page-proved open-PR
list holding zero entries is a fact (a repository with no open PRs), answered as `swept 0 0`; a
list read that failed or could not prove completeness is `11`/`13`. v1 printed the same sentence —
"no orphan red PRs to heal" — for both, with the scanned count only on stderr, beside nothing.

**A PR that closes between the list read and its classification** answers `not-open`. It is
dropped from the emitted rows and from the `stalled` count, but **stays in `scanned`** — the list
read genuinely covered it — and a stderr notice names it. Counting it as stalled would report a
merged PR as a strand; dropping it from `scanned` would quietly shrink the scope the answer rests on.

**The sweep's own cost is bounded, and it says so.** Each PR costs `diagnose`'s full read set — plus,
where GitHub has not computed that PR's mergeability yet, up to `--mergeability-seconds` of re-reads
waiting on the lazy job — so a 200-PR board is a four-figure number of REST calls — against the very rate limit this group's own
taxonomy classifies as a transient. The verb reads the rate-limit headers as it goes and, on
exhaustion, **refuses `11` naming the reset time with nothing partial emitted**: a sweep that
silently covered 60 of 200 PRs and printed a stalled count would be the truncated-scope answer this
group refuses everywhere else. Concurrency is bounded at 4 in-flight classifications, stated here
so an implementer does not pick a number that reaches the limit faster than the board is read.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `11` | the open-PR list, or a per-PR classification read, failed, or the API rate limit was exhausted mid-sweep — the sweep is UNKNOWN, never a shorter list |
| `13` | the open-PR enumeration never reached a terminal page, or the open-PR count exceeds `--limit` |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `heal-ci sweep: cannot list open PRs in <repo>: <reason> — the sweep is UNKNOWN, never "none stranded".` | 11 | refusal |
| `heal-ci sweep: rate limit exhausted after <k> of <m> PRs, resets at <ts> — refusing a partial board.` | 11 | refusal |
| `heal-ci sweep: cannot classify #<n>: <reason> — refusing a sweep with a hole in it.` | 11 | refusal |
| `heal-ci sweep: #<n> is gone (404) between the list read and its classification — counted as scanned, not stalled.` | 0 | notice |
| `heal-ci sweep: the open-PR read never reached a terminal page — pagination is unexhausted; refusing to report a partial board.` | 13 | refusal |
| `heal-ci sweep: <k> open PRs exceeds --limit <m> — refusing to answer over a subset; raise the limit.` | 13 | refusal |
| `heal-ci sweep: scanned <k> open PRs, <m> stranded past <n>m.` | 0 | notice |
| `heal-ci sweep: #<n> closed between the list read and its classification — counted as scanned, not stalled.` | 0 | notice |

**Scope** — every open pull request in the repository, paginated to a terminal page, each
classified by `diagnose`'s shared predicate chain. A single unclassifiable PR fails the whole
sweep on `11` rather than being silently dropped: a board report with an unnamed hole in it is the
false-completeness this verb exists to prevent.

**Examples**

```

```

```
$ fabrika heal-ci sweep
swept	18	0
```

**Grounding**

- The 2026-08-09 design input behind this group — both live strands were found by luck rather than
  by a sweep, so the lane must be reachable on a schedule, and it must classify green PRs and not
  only red ones.
- A detector emits claimable work and never adopts or dispatches.
- The scanned count travels with the claim; a zero-stall answer over an unproven scope is the pass
  a guard must never emit.
- v1's `orphan-heal` — scheduled `--execute` writes, prose on stdout with the structured ledger on
  stderr, zero-scope reported identically to a real empty result, and idempotency resting on a
  body-text marker greppable across every open issue.

## `heal-ci surface`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika heal-ci surface 9412 [--sha 03135b91] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--sha` | string | no | the live head | the head to enumerate producing runs at |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. First line:
`surface\t<covered|gap|no-requirements|unprobeable>\t<sha>`. Then one line per declared required context:

```
required	<context-name>	<producing|absent>
```

then one line per gating run at the head answering no declared requirement:

```
extra	<context-name>
```

and last `facts\trequired:<n>\tproducing:<n>\textra:<n>`, where **`producing` counts the declared
required contexts that have a producing run** — so `producing <= required`, always, and
`required - producing` is exactly the number of `absent` rows. It is not the size of the producing
set; that number is `producing + extra`.

With `--json`: `{"outcome":…,"sha":…,"required":[{"name":…,"state":…}…],"extra":[…],"counts":{"required":<n>,"producing":<n>,"extra":<n>}}`.

**`unprobeable` is the permission answer, and it is not `no-requirements`.** The two halves of the
declared set do not read alike, and the difference is load-bearing — **probed live against a real
repository with a `repo`-scoped token (scopes `repo`, `workflow`, `read:org`, no `admin`) rather
than assumed, never taken on trust**:

- `GET /repos/{repo}/branches/{base}/protection` answered **`404 "Branch not protected"`**. That
  status is returned **both** when a branch genuinely has no protection **and** when the caller
  lacks the admin permission to see it. It is ambiguous by construction, so **a 404 here is never,
  on its own, evidence of anything** — treating it as `no-requirements` is the proven-absent /
  could-not-read collapse this contract refuses everywhere else.
- `GET /repos/{repo}/rulesets` answered with the **full ruleset list at ordinary `repo` scope**, no
  admin required.

So the rulesets read is what carries the answer, and the rules are:

- **`no-requirements`** has exactly two ways in:
  - **The branch declares nothing.** A **successful** rulesets read returns zero rules that require
    a status context for this base, *and* the protection endpoint answers 404. Both, never the 404
    alone.
  - **The repository's plan cannot declare anything.** On a private repository on the free plan,
    rulesets and branch protection are paid features. Either read answers `403` with a `message`
    beginning `Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public`, to every token, admin
    included. That answer is the platform saying no required context can exist on this base, not a
    read that failed. The verb answers `no-requirements` and names the plan gate on stderr.
- **`unprobeable`** is when the rulesets read is permission-denied — any `401`/`403` except the plan
  gate above — or when the protection 404 is the only signal and the rulesets read did not
  complete. The verb answers at exit `0`, prints `required:-` on its facts line, and emits no
  `required` rows.

Collapsing `unprobeable` into `no-requirements` would tell an adopter their repo gates nothing when
it may gate everything — the single most dangerous wrong answer this verb can give. Collapsing it
into `11` would fail every `diagnose` call made with a token that cannot see protection, leaving
the whole skill inert on the common case.

**`no-requirements` is a proven answer at exit `0`** — a base branch with no protection rule and
no ruleset requiring a status context genuinely gates nothing, which is the ordinary state of a
fresh or foreign repository. It is not a gap and not a failure. A protection surface that cannot be read **for any reason other
than this token's permission or the plan gate** — a transport failure, a 5xx — is `11`. A permission
denial is the `unprobeable` answer above and a plan gate is the `no-requirements` answer above;
neither is a failed read.

**The comparison, precisely.** The declared set is the union of the base branch's
`required_status_checks.contexts` and every `required_status_checks` rule in a repository ruleset
whose ref condition matches the base — both REST, both paginated. The producing set is the gating
check-run context names at `--sha`, informational contexts excluded (`isInformational`). A
declared context with no producing run is `absent`; a producing gating run matching no declared
context is `extra`. `gap` iff at least one `absent` row exists.

**`extra` rows are reported, never judged.** A gating run answering no requirement is normal in a
healthy repo — most CI jobs are not required contexts. The row exists because the *inverse*
mistake is the incident: one repository armed a required context for an analysis that never runs in
the batch context, another armed one whose name no run produces, and both wedged the entire merge
queue. Printing both sides is what lets a reader see which of the two they have.

**This verb changes nothing.** Arming, renaming and disarming a required context are repository
settings changes with a human's name on them.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR or the `--sha` commit is proven absent (404) |
| `11` | the branch protection, the ruleset list, or the check runs could not be read for a reason other than this token's permission or the plan gate — coverage is UNKNOWN, never `covered` and never `no-requirements` |

**Scope** — the PR's base branch protection, the repository's rulesets filtered to those matching
the base ref, and the check runs at `--sha`. Both sides paginated and count-checked; the
comparison is total over what was read.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika heal-ci surface 9412

facts	required:0	producing:0	extra:2
```

**Grounding**

- A required check armed with a workflow-name context wedged a whole merge queue; the `absent` row
  is that state made visible before it is armed, and the verb refuses to arm anything.
- Arming code-scanning wedged a queue because the default analysis never runs in the batch context:
  a declared context with no producing run, which is exactly the `absent` row.
- Non-hermetic deployed-worker smoke drift once evicted four approved control-plane PRs; the
  `extra` side of the report is what makes a drifting non-required job visible.
- v1 read check-runs at the head and nothing else — a repo-wide search of its skill for
  `protection`, `required_status`, `merge_queue` and `mergeable` returns zero hits — so the entire
  class was invisible to it, and a config-broken red was filed as a code defect against a clean diff.

## `heal-ci logs`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika heal-ci logs 9412 [--sha 03135b91] [--context <name>] [--max-bytes 65536] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--sha` | string | no | the live head | the head whose failing jobs to read |
| `--context` | string | no | all failing | read only this gating context's log rather than every failing one |
| `--max-bytes` | integer | no | `65536` | per-context tail budget; the log's **last** N bytes are kept, the failure being at the end |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. First line: `logs\t<count>\t<sha>` — the number of failing gating
contexts whose log follows. Then, per context, a header line and the log bytes delimited so a
consumer can split without guessing:

```
==== context <name> job <id> bytes <k> truncated <true|false> ====
<log text>
==== end <name> ====
```

`logs\t0\t<sha>` is a valid, proven answer: nothing gating is failing at this head.
With `--json`: `{"outcome":"logs","sha":…,"count":<n>,"contexts":[{"name":…,"jobId":<n|null>,"bytes":<n>,"truncated":<bool>,"text":…}…]}`.

**Every failing gating context is read, not the first.** v1 took `jq '.failing[0]'` and discarded
the rest with no record in any output field, comment or issue, so an N-context red silently became
one routed action and N−1 losses. Where `--context` narrows the read, the header count still
reports the total failing set so a caller can see what it chose not to look at.

**No diagnostic is ever written to stdout.** The log body is the answer channel, and v1 wrote its
own English error text onto the same stream, interleaved with the log — so a caller
pattern-matching the log for failure signatures matched heal-ci's own prose as if it were CI
output. Every scope line, truncation notice and read failure goes to stderr.

**A failing context with no job behind it is an answer, not a refusal.** A check run posted by an
app or an external service has no workflow job and therefore no log. Such a context is emitted with
`job -`, `bytes 0`, `truncated false` and an empty body, and it counts toward the header's total.
Refusing the whole read would let one external check hide the logs of every other failing context —
the opposite of this verb's purpose — and a stderr notice names each context served this way.

**Truncation is declared, never silent.** The `truncated` field is part of the header because a
tail-bounded log that reads as complete is how a classifier concludes "no signature matched" over
bytes it never saw.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |

| `7` | the PR or the `--sha` commit is proven absent (404), or `--context` names a context that does not exist at this head |

**Scope** — the blocking check runs at one commit, the workflow runs behind them, and one log per
failing context, each read paginated and count-checked. The base branch's declared required set is
read before anything is fetched, so a failure outside it never enters this lane — it leaves named on
stderr instead. A base branch declaring nothing required falls back to the informational-name
denylist, and so does a plan-gated base (see `surface`), whose branch cannot declare a required
check; a required set that could not be read is `11` naming that read as the cause.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika heal-ci logs 9413 --sha 9fe12ab0
logs	1	9fe12ab0
==== context unit tests job 44182736450 bytes 66 truncated false ====
FAIL src/cart.test.ts > adds a line

==== end unit tests ====
```

```
$ fabrika heal-ci logs 9412 --sha 03135b91
logs	0	03135b91
```

**Grounding**

- v1's `resolve-failing-run.sh:63` read `.failing[0]` only; the discarded contexts appear in no
  output, no comment and no issue.
- v1's `failed-logs.sh` wrote its UNKNOWN diagnostic to stdout, into the log stream a caller
  greps for signatures, and its own header documents that an unreadable read must not arrive as
  the documented-empty answer — which is exactly what it does when `gh` exits 0 with no bytes.
- v1's three `gh run` calls omitted `--repo`, so a run id resolved against whatever repository the
  process happened to be standing in.
- Only reds the base branch declares required reach this lane; the required-set read happens before the fetch.

## `heal-ci classify`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika heal-ci classify [--json]
```

The log text arrives on **stdin only** — no `--file`, no `--path`. This verb is pure: it opens no
socket and reads no repository, which is what makes it unit-testable against fixtures and what
keeps a classification reproducible from the bytes alone.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| stdin | text | yes | — | `heal-ci logs`' framed output, or one bare log body |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. First line `classified\t<n>`, then one line per classified context:

```
class	<context>	<transient|logic|derived|unclassified>	<signature-id>	<matched-line>
```

`<context>` is the name from the `==== context … ====` header the block came from, or `-` when
stdin carried a bare body with no framing. On `unclassified` the last two fields are both `-`; the
field count never varies.
With `--json`: `{"outcome":"classified","count":<n>,"contexts":[{"context":…,"class":…,"signature":…,"line":<n|null>}…]}`.
`class` is one of `"transient"`, `"logic"`, `"derived"` or `"unclassified"`; `signature` and `line`
are `null` on `unclassified` and set on the other three.

**This verb consumes the framed multi-context stream, so nothing splits it by hand.** `heal-ci
logs` emits N contexts and this verb emits N `class` lines, in the order received — `fabrika
heal-ci logs 9412 | fabrika heal-ci classify` is the whole pipeline. Leaving the split to the
caller would put a hand-rolled parser on the one surface this skill declares attacker-authorable,
and would let a five-context stream be classified as one signature by whichever pattern matched
first. A bare body with no `==== context` header is classified as a single block under context `-`.

**`<matched-line>` is 1-based within the block it was found in**, counting from the line after that
block's `==== context … ====` header, so a signature's coordinate does not move when an unrelated
context is added upstream. For an unframed stdin it is 1-based over the whole input.

**Default-deny, structurally.** The only path to `transient` is a positive match in a `transient`
row. Everything else is `logic` when a `logic` row matched, `derived` when only the roll-up row
did, and `unclassified` when none did.
**`unclassified` is a third token deliberately**, where v1's classifier had only two: fusing "I
recognise this as a deterministic bug" with "I recognise nothing" means a caller can never count
how often the classifier is guessing, and the routing differs — a logic signature goes to repair,
an unrecognised failure is filed for a human. There is no path from ambiguous input to `transient`.

**`derived` is a fourth token, for a log that only restates another job's verdict.** A roll-up
context goes red because a job it watches did not succeed, and its log holds that job's verdict and
no failure of its own. `logic` would name a defect the log does not contain, and `unclassified`
would file one defect twice: once for the job that failed and once for the roll-up repeating it.
The token does not mean "ignore this line". The roll-up's FAIL lines name the job to route, and
when that job never reported, the roll-up is the only context that shows the failure, which is why
`heal-ci logs` still emits it. `unclassified` keeps its meaning: nothing matched.

**`derived` is a signature class, and `gate-failed` is a stall class.** The first lives in the
signature table (`signatures.ts`) and answers why one log cannot be read as a defect of its own;
`classify` prints it once per failing context. The second belongs to `heal-ci diagnose`'s stall
vocabulary (`stall.ts`) and answers why one pull request is stuck, once per pull request, off a
SHA-bound review-gate verdict. Neither token appears in the other's union, and a pull request whose
only failing context is `derived` is not thereby `gate-failed`.

**The taxonomy is a single-sourced, ORDERED table, and it is data.** Each row carries a stable id,
a class, a literal pattern and a rationale, in one module, with the table under unit test against
committed fixture logs. **The first row whose pattern matches, in the order printed, is the
answer** — ordering is part of the contract because the classes genuinely overlap (an OOM-killed
suite prints assertion output before it dies, and a preview target answering `502` matches both a
warmup and a generic network row). Specific rows precede general ones, and transient rows precede
logic rows so that an infrastructure death is not read as the assertion failure it printed on its
way down. Patterns are case-insensitive, applied per line.

| # | id | class | pattern (JavaScript regular expression, `i` flag, per line) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `runner-oom` | transient | `/\b(sigkill\|out of memory\|oom-killed\|exit code 137)\b/` |
| 2 | `runner-cancelled-infra` | transient | `/\b(the runner has received a shutdown signal\|the operation was canceled by the (?:runner\|server))\b/` |
| 3 | `rate-limited` | transient | `/\b(429\|rate limit exceeded\|secondary rate limit\|api rate limit\|quota exceeded)\b/` |
| 4 | `preview-warmup` | transient | `/(preview\|deployment\|deployed target).{0,80}?\b(not reachable\|did not become reachable\|connection refused\|502\|503\|504)\b/` |
| 5 | `readiness-stall` | transient | `/\b(readiness\|health ?check\|waiting for .{0,40}to be ready)\b.{0,60}\b(timed out\|timeout\|exceeded)\b/` |
| 6 | `network-transient` | transient | `/\b(etimedout\|econnreset\|econnrefused\|enotfound\|eai_again\|socket hang up\|tls handshake timeout)\b/` |
| 7 | `assertion-failure` | logic | `/\b(assertionerror\|expected .{0,40} to (?:be\|equal\|contain)\|toEqual\|toBe)\b/` |
| 8 | `typecheck-failure` | logic | `/\berror TS\d{4,5}\b/` |
| 9 | `lint-failure` | logic | `/\b(eslint\|biome)\b.{0,60}\berror\b\|^\s*error\s+.{0,80}\s+@?[\w/-]+\/[\w-]+$/` |
| 10 | `build-failure` | logic | `/\b(cannot find module\|module not found\|failed to resolve import\|syntaxerror\|unexpected token)\b/` |
| 11 | `roll-up-verdict` | derived | `/\bresult=\S+ (?:→\|->) FAIL\b/` |

An implementer ships exactly these eleven rows in this order; the table grows by adding rows, never
by branching inside the verb. Row 4 preceding row 6 is what makes a failure to reach **this PR's own
preview target** a warmup rather than generic network trouble.

**Row 11 is last, and a row added later goes above it.** It is the only row whose match says the
log holds no failure of its own, so every row that names a real failure has to be able to beat it:
a roll-up log that also printed a defect classifies on the defect. Last place is also what proves
no generic row reaches roll-up prose. A log holding only that prose classifies `derived` only when
all ten rows above it missed, and the committed `ci-required` fixture holds that under test.

**The pattern matches a per-job `result=<r> → FAIL` line and nothing else the roll-up prints.** The
terminal `ci-required FAILED` line is left unmatched on purpose. A roll-up that could not read its
own scope (it was told of no gating job, or a declared job's required-ness was missing) prints that
terminal line under a `ci-required: …` reason and no per-job FAIL line. That failure is the
roll-up's own and names no job to route, so it classifies `unclassified` and leaves through intake.
Every roll-up red that does restate a job carries that job's FAIL line, so the row loses nothing
by it.

**A committed-secret finding is deliberately not a row.** A secret scanner's red (gitleaks'
`leaks found: <n>`) classifies `unclassified` and leaves through intake to a person. No row may
route it to repair: a `logic` row would hand an agent builder a pull request carrying a live
secret, and the fix is to remove the secret and rotate the credential, which stays a human call
every time. A new row must not match that shape.

**Empty stdin is `3`, not `unclassified`.** A verb that classified nothing and a verb that read
nothing must not answer the same way.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing — there is no log to classify |

**Errors**

**Scope** — the bytes on stdin, nothing else. Not a judging verb over a repository surface, so

row 7 is its line 2.)

```

```

(One defect, two failing contexts. The `ci-required` block's line 2 is
`unit: should_run=true result=failure → FAIL`, which names the job the second line classifies.)

**Grounding**

- v1's `failure-classifier` was correct in its default-deny core and ships **dormant with zero live
  callers**; its two-class output could not express "I recognise nothing", and its rationale went
  to stderr as prose, unrecoverable by any pipe.
- A green PR went red on a preview-warmup flake and a human had to decide rerun versus real
  regression; row 4 is that signature, and the third token keeps an unrecognised failure from being
  guessed into a rerun.
- A table of prose descriptions is an uninvented core that passes every presence check; the literal
  patterns and the stated precedence are what make two implementations agree.
- The blocking-set narrowing happens upstream in `logs`, so this table never encodes which
  contexts are the blocking ones.
- One red produced two `unclassified` lines and three filed issues, because the required roll-up
  context repeated a sibling job's failure. The ruling took a fourth token over excluding the
  roll-up upstream, which would lose the only signal when a job should have run and never
  reported; the signature table's docblock cites it.

## `heal-ci rerun`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika heal-ci rerun 9412 --run 9182736450 --sha 03135b91 --signature preview-warmup [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--run` | integer | yes | — | the workflow run to re-run the failed jobs of |
| `--sha` | string | yes | — | the head the transient was diagnosed at; the at-most-once guard is per head |
| `--signature` | string | yes | — | the `transient` `classify` signature id justifying the rerun; recorded in the durable marker |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. One line: `rerun\t<new-attempt>\t<run-id>\t<marker-url>` where
`<new-attempt>` is the run's `run_attempt` **read back after the request**, never the value the
caller held. With `--json`: `{"outcome":"rerun","attempt":<n>,"run":<id>,"markerUrl":…}`.

**The verb owns the guard, and this is the single most important clause in the contract.** In
order, trusting nothing it was told:

1. **Re-derive the head binding.** The live head must prefix-match `--sha`, else `12`: a rerun
   justified by a diagnosis of one tree must not fire against another.
2. **Re-derive the failure state.** The run must exist, belong to this PR's head, and have
   concluded `failure` (or `timed_out`/`cancelled`). Proven otherwise → `14`, nothing touched.
3. **Re-derive at-most-once, from two independent signals, both fully paginated.** The head has
   already been rerun if the run's `run_attempt` is ≥ 2, **or** a `heal-ci` rerun marker comment
   exists bound to this `--sha`. Either → `14`. The two are kept because each covers the other's
   hole: `run_attempt` can be bumped by a human or another tool, and a marker can be edited away.
4. **Request the rerun** of the failed jobs only.
5. **Read back the run** and require `run_attempt` to have increased. A request that returned 2xx
   without materialising a new attempt is `8` — and critically, **no marker is written on that
   path**, because v1 wrote the durable marker on the strength of the dispatch response and thereby
   blocked every future rerun of a run that never re-ran.
6. **Write the marker comment** in the format specified above, and read it back through
   `normalizeForReadback`. A create that **fails** after a confirmed new attempt is `16`; a create
   that lands but whose read-back does not match is `9`. Both mean the same operationally — the
   rerun is spent and unrecorded — and both are reported at once rather than as a stop.

Steps 4–6 are one logical operation whose ordering is deliberate: the rerun before the marker
means an interrupted run leaves a re-runnable state rather than a permanently blocked one, and the
read-back in step 5 is what makes step 6's marker true.

**The signature's class is re-derived too, before any read.** `--signature` must name a row of
`classify`'s table whose class is `transient`, else `10`. A `logic` or `derived` id is refused
exactly as an unknown one is: the budget is one rerun per head, so spending it on a red a retry
cannot change leaves the pull request less healable than before the call.

**Why the guard cannot live in the skill.** v1's `rerun-once.sh` accepted no already-rerun input
and performed no check of its own; the entire one-rerun invariant rested on the model remembering
a number it had read several steps earlier. A session-memory invariant is not an invariant. The
`14` refusal is this verb's structural anchor, and a caller that has convinced itself a second
rerun is warranted still cannot get one.

**A `14` refusal is a success.** The state was proven and nothing was mutated; a second rerun is
escalation, not retry.

**This verb takes no view on whether the rerun is wise.** Where the failing context is itself a
gate checking its own output, a bounded retry can be actively harmful; that judgment is
the skill's, and it is exercised before this verb is called.

**Scope** — one PR's live head and state, one workflow run's conclusion and attempt count, the
PR's comments paginated and count-checked for a bound marker, one rerun request, one confirming
run read, one comment write, one confirming comment read.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika heal-ci rerun 9413 --run 9182736450 --sha 9fe12ab0 --signature preview-warmup
rerun	2	9182736450	https://github.com/acme/repo/pull/9413#issuecomment-5155001122
```

```
$ fabrika heal-ci rerun 9413 --run 9182736450 --sha 9fe12ab0 --signature preview-warmup
heal-ci rerun: head 9fe12ab0 was already rerun (run_attempt=2) — a second rerun is escalation, not retry.
$ echo $?
14
```

**Grounding**

- v1's `rerun-once.sh` — the guard lived in the agent's head, the marker count read one unpaginated
  page, the dispatch response was trusted as proof, and the reported "new run id" was the old one.
  All four are designed out here: the guard is in the verb, the read paginates and count-checks,
  the read-back gates the marker, and the printed attempt is the one read back.
- The flake that only needed a rerun, and the human who had to decide it was one.
- A bounded retry is harmful where the failing check is a gate reading its own output; the judgment
  stays in the skill and this verb records the signature that justified it.
- A shape borrowed from a sibling but not shared: the one mutation that could compound is guarded
  by a re-derived precondition rather than by caller discipline.

## `heal-ci note`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika heal-ci note 9412 --class <stall-token> --sha <40-hex head> [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

The body arrives on **stdin only** — no `--body`, no `--body-file`; a path flag is how a
machine-local path reaches a public surface while the poster reads success.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--class` | string | yes | — | the stall class this note records — one of `heal-ci diagnose`'s eleven tokens, the key's middle field |
| `--sha` | string | yes | — | the head the classification was taken at, as a **full 40-hex** sha |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |
| stdin | markdown | yes | — | the durable note: the terminal token and its reason, as the skill's terminal vocabulary phrases them |

**Output** — machine channel. One line: `noted\t<comment-url>`.
With `--json`: `{"outcome":"noted","commentUrl":…,"key":"<pr>:<class>:<head>"}`.

Leak-scanned (`report/leaks.ts`, imported), posted as a **new** comment — a strand's history is a
history, not a state, and each classification is its own record — then read back through
`normalizeForReadback`. A note on a closed or merged PR is legal: a strand that resolved while the
run was classifying it still deserves the record.

**Suppressed per `<pr>:<class>:<head>`, inside the verb.** What is *not* its own record is the same
classification of the same head by a second caller: two sweeps three minutes apart left up to six
substantively identical notes on one pull request. Before creating, `note` reads the pull
request's **whole** comment history and refuses `14` when a comment already carries this exact key,
posting nothing. One key earns exactly one note for as long as the PR is open, so a strand is
re-noticed only when its class changes or a new commit lands on its head — the two events that make
the earlier note stale. The key's format is the block above under
["The note suppression key"](#the-note-suppression-key-is-a-specified-format-too); the reader and
writer are `heal-ci/note-key.ts`, and the verb composes the marker itself — a caller never writes one
into the body.

**`--sha` is a full sha here, and a divergence from the live head is a notice.** The key is an
identity and an identity built from an abbreviation cannot be compared for equality, so a 7-40 value
is a usage error (`1`) rather than something to prefix-match — the same incident produced two notes on
one PR citing `6d8fc285…` and `6d8fc283…`, a hand-typed prefix diverging in its fifth digit. And
unlike `heal-ci rerun`, a head that moved under this write does **not** refuse `12`: a note is the
record of a classification taken at a head, so refusing here would lose the only trace of a strand
somebody just diagnosed. The verb says so on stderr and records at the head it was given.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `1` | `--sha` is not a full 40-hex sha |
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing |
| `5` | the body carries a machine-local path |
| `6` | the body is a bare `@` path reference |
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404) |
| `8` | the comment create, or its confirming re-read, failed — UNKNOWN whether it landed |
| `9` | the comment landed but the read-back does not match |
| `10` | `--class` is off the eleven-token stall vocabulary |
| `11` | the PR, or its comment history, could not be read — nothing was posted |
| `13` | the comment enumeration is short of the PR's declared count — nothing was posted |
| `14` | refused: this key is already recorded on the PR — nothing was written |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |

| `heal-ci note: #<n> already carries a note at key <pr>:<class>:<head> (comment <id>) — this strand is recorded; nothing was posted.` | 14 | refusal |

**Scope** — one PR, one fully paginated comment read, one comment write, one read-back.

A second caller over the same strand at the same head:

```
$ fabrika heal-ci note 9412 --class gated-unshipped --sha 03135b91aa04f7e2c9d8b1640a5c22e9f01b7d3c < note.md

$ echo $?
14
```

**Grounding**

- The durable-signal rule the sibling groups share: a lane that stops without a record leaves the
  next reader with nothing, and for this lane that is the whole defect — an invisible strand is
  what the skill exists to make visible.
- v1's two comment writers discarded their responses to `/dev/null`, so the only routed action of
  an invocation was reported done on the strength of a write response rather than a read-back.
- The leak predicate is generic by design and is imported, never re-derived.
- The suppression once lived in the scheduled sweep workflow's own `run:` block, which built the
  key, paged the comments and globbed for a hit. That deduped the scheduled path alone, left every
  other caller posting bare, and put the workflow on the wrong side of the relay rule — a script
  deriving a decision rather than relaying a verb's. Moving it here fixes both, and every note path
  now inherits the suppression.

## `heal-ci scratch`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika heal-ci scratch 9412 --slug note
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number this lane is repairing |
| `--slug` | string | yes | — | the leaf filename under the lane's directory; kebab-case, no path separators |

**Output** — machine channel. One absolute path:
`<temp root>/fabrika-heal-ci/<session-id>/<pr>/<slug>`. The directory is created if absent; **the leaf
file is not** — the caller allocates, writes the body, then reads it back on stdin. Redirecting
`note`'s stdin straight from an unwritten path posts nothing on a first run and posts the *previous*
classification's body on a second, the path being a pure function of session, PR and slug.

Two healers deriving similar working filenames in one working directory overwrote each other's note
bodies mid-post — the failure `build scratch` and `triage scratch` already make
unconstructible for their lanes.

**No nonce and no `--token`, unlike the sibling allocators.** They key on a claim nonce because a
build or triage fan-out runs many lanes under one session id, so the session alone hands them all one
directory. This group has no claim verb and no fan-out: a `heal-ci` run is one forked shell, so two
concurrent healers are two session ids, and within one of them the PR under repair separates one
sweep row from the next. Both halves of the key are already in the path, and minting a nonce for a
lane identity that does not exist would key the namespace on a value nothing else in the run can
reproduce.

The printed path is machine-local by definition and must never reach a posted artifact — which is why
`heal-ci note` reds on one (`5`).

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `1` | the directory could not be created, the positional is not a PR number, no session id is set (`FABRIKA_SESSION_ID` → `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` → `PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_SESSION`), or the id is not one path segment |
| `10` | `--slug` carries a path separator or is not kebab-case |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `heal-ci scratch: <n> is not a pull-request number.` | 1 | usage |
| `heal-ci scratch: no session id is set — FABRIKA_SESSION_ID, CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID, PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_SESSION are all unset — refusing to key a scratch namespace on an unattributable session.` | 1 | refusal |
| `heal-ci scratch: the session id is not one path segment — it cannot name a directory of its own.` | 1 | refusal |
| `heal-ci scratch: cannot create <dir>: <reason>` | 1 | refusal |
| `heal-ci scratch: --slug "<value>" must be a kebab-case leaf, no path separators.` | 10 | refusal |

**Scope** — one directory allocation. No network, no repository read, no write to any surface.

**Grounding**

- `build scratch` and `triage scratch`: a namespace keyed on the session alone hands every lane the
  same directory, and a fixed name like `note.md` clobbers a sibling's file silently.
- The CLI never mints an identity when the session chain comes up empty.

## Where this spec leaves questions open

Two decisions bear on this group and are **not** resolved here, because neither is this session's
to make. Each is cited at its site above.

| Question | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Which surface owns an unpulled PR — this lane, the construction lane, or a new one | An open ticket marked `ready-for:human`, awaiting a founder ruling. This spec answers "how is the state named", never "whose job is it". |
| Whether the red-**main** response layer supersedes, feeds, or is disjoint from this lane | An open ticket whose acceptance criteria require a decision record stating the relationship to this group. A ruling there may re-scope `sweep`. |

## The eval-enumeration obligation (leaf rule)

Stated once, in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md)'s "Eval enumeration" section — the single home that
obligation lives in. This spec adds nothing to it; the eval mechanics belong to their own ticket.
