# `/ship` — derived CLI contract

**Skill:** [`ship`](SKILL.md) · **Date:** 2026-08-08

These verbs live in `packages/fabrika-cli/`, binary `fabrika`, grouped under a `ship`
subcommand, beside the `adr`, `report`, `review`, `triage` and `wire` groups already
implemented there. (The skill directory and the CLI group are both `ship`, so every
invocation reads as a sentence — `fabrika ship enqueue`. One skill, one group; the mapping is
stated here once.) The [CLI interface convention](../../docs/cli-interface-convention.md)
governs them; where this spec and that doc disagree, the doc wins and this spec is the bug.

**`fabrika` calls `pipeline-cli` nowhere, and neither does the skill.** Every verb
below is implemented from scratch. v1's ship-it (2077 lines, 21 scripts) and the fourteen
`pipeline-cli` tools it drives were read for their semantics and their scars — each Grounding
section names what the v1 counterpart gets wrong and what this spec does instead — but no clause
defers to one, and none is invoked.

**Substrate.** Effect CLI verbs on the `@effect/platform-node` seam the sibling groups use.
GitHub access through the `gh api` REST shape — with **two sanctioned carves**, both stated
because the REST-only rule needs its boundary written down, and neither widening past the verbs
named here.

1. **The GraphQL exception — `ship threads` and `ship resolve`, and no other verb.** Review-thread
   resolution state (`reviewThreads.isResolved`) and the `resolveReviewThread` mutation have no
   REST equivalent, and the org's GraphQL breakage is live-verified Projects-scoped, not blanket.
   Exactly two verbs issue a GraphQL request; every other verb is REST.
2. **The auto-merge porcelain carve — `ship enqueue` and `ship disarm`, and no other verb.**
   Enabling and disabling auto-merge have **no REST surface at all**, so both go through `gh`'s own
   `gh pr merge --auto` / `--disable-auto` porcelain. Without this
   carve the Substrate clause forbade the only way `ship enqueue` can do the arming the same
   contract requires of it. It is named as a **porcelain** carve, not a second GraphQL exception:
   this spec issues no auto-merge GraphQL mutation of its own, and the carve does not license one.

Named because a spec that leaves the substrate open makes the implementer guess.

## Verb inventory

| Verb | Purpose | Split test |
|---|---|---|
| `ship scope` | one PR's state, head, linked issue, class set with required namespaces, and §CP three-state classification | path partition against single-sourced maps, exhaustion-checked reads, and closing-keyword resolution are mechanical; what each state means for the run is judgment |
| `ship cp-approval` | the roster-cardinality discharge: `discharge` / `stop` / `base-conflicted` / `n/a` from head-bound signals only | the case split and the head-binding are a transcription of a ruled table; nothing in it is judgment, and a verb that judged here shipped an unapproved control-plane PR |
| `ship gate` | the verdict conjunction: every required namespace's in-force, current-head verdict, §CP advisory resolution and native-review fold included | in-force resolution (write-stamp ordering, staleness, authorization) is mechanical; what to do with `blocked` is judgment |
| `ship floor` | whether the governance floor binds on this diff and is discharged at this head — `n/a` / `satisfied` / a refusal CI reds on | asking `ship gate` for the one `governance` namespace and seating the answer on an exit code is mechanical; nothing about the verdict itself is decided here |
| `ship floor-batch` | the same required context on a merge queue's batched `merge_group` head, concluded success — the batch ref has no pull request to resolve a floor over | publishing a named row is mechanical; the verb decides nothing, and what the floor means was settled at each PR's own head |
| `ship checks` | the head CI rollup — green/red/pending with the running/wedged split and the zero-checkset facts; `--wait` adds the bounded settle poll | latest-per-context dedupe, status vocabulary, and a budgeted poll are mechanical; the wedge remedy is a human's |
| `ship threads` | every unresolved review thread, fully paginated, with per-thread class facts | pagination, count proof, and author-type classification are mechanical; nit-vs-substantive is THE retained judgment and never enters this verb |
| `ship resolve` | the sanctioned thread-resolution write: rationale reply, resolve mutation, read-back — refusing any thread not positively bot-classed | the protocol and the bot-only structural anchor are mechanical; deciding a bot thread is a nit is the skill's |
| `ship enqueue` | arm the queue's auto-merge at a pinned head, method-flag-free by construction, and prove the arm landed | the arm, its error discrimination, and the entry read are mechanical; whether the PR should ship was settled by the gates |
| `ship merge` | the second landing path: land directly on a base branch no merge queue governs, with the method read off the repository, and prove the landing | reading the regime, picking a permitted method and proving `merged` + the merge commit are mechanical; whether the PR should ship was settled by the gates |
| `ship reconcile` | the bounded post-enqueue watch: `landed` / `ejected` / `unresolved` / `parked`, each a proven answer at exit 0 — and, at `--polls 1`, the one read the driver's `ship:queued` wait cell relays | multi-signal terminal classification against timeline + base-branch evidence is mechanical; what ejection means for the lane is judgment |
| `ship disarm` | the four-site merge-intent lifecycle: `kept` / `disarmed`, read-back-verified | the site policy table and the verified write are mechanical |
| `ship nudge` | the at-most-once dropped-trigger remedy: re-derive the zero-runs state, close→reopen, verify both legs | the precondition re-derivation and the guarded PATCH pair are mechanical; the verb refuses rather than trusting its dispatch |
| `ship note` | the durable stop-path comment: stdin body, leak-scanned, read back | posting with the sibling groups' write protocol is mechanical; what the note says is the skill's |
| `ship release` | dark-ship detection and the board's awaiting-release label, read-back-verified | the three ground-truth signals and the label write are mechanical; the flip is a human's |

### Considered and deliberately not derived

Each is a real proposal someone could make again. (Conventions §7 homes these in a plugin-root
`.out-of-scope/`, which no fabrika skill has bootstrapped yet; until it exists they live
inline, the same tracked debt the sibling contracts carry.)

- **A second answer to any CI-enforced question.** `ci-required` is the always-on required
  status context (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the merge queue awaits it on the `merge_group`
  ref); `codeowners-cp.yml` gates the §CP-boundary↔CODEOWNERS drift;
  `unresolved-threads-guard.yml` gates thread *accounting* against the review verdict;
  `leak-guard.yml` and `gitleaks.yml` gate landed content. A fabrika copy of any of these could
  only agree redundantly or contradict an enforced verdict. `ship checks` reads
  those gates' *results* at the head; it recomputes none of their judgments. `ship threads`
  reads resolution *state* (which threads are open, who wrote them) — a different question from
  the guard's accounting check, needed because the skill's one judgment consumes it.
- **A §CP membership verdict.** The merge-time enforcement of control-plane review is
  CODEOWNERS plus the ruleset, server-side, and stays there. `ship scope`'s `cp` line is not a
  second verdict on that gated question — it is the routing input the skill's own
  approval-aware path cannot run without, and it is **derived from `.github/CODEOWNERS`
  itself** (the artifact the gate enforces, read from **the PR's base ref** — the branch the PR
  targets; see the verb block), so
  there is no second vocabulary to drift. It **holds on a trivial or empty boundary rather
  than matching everything** — a boundary matching every path, and one built from a pattern that
  captures nothing, both read as "everything is owned", which is not what either says — and a
  *failed* boundary read is the `11`
  refusal, never "ordinary". No `ship` verb re-states the §CP path list in prose; prose copies are how the
  list drifts.
- **A wedge-clearing verb** (cancel the stranded check, re-run it). The lever mutates CI runs
  the shipper does not own, and a bounded run cannot supervise the retry it triggers. `ship checks` diagnoses `wedged` and names the check; the lever
  is an operator's.
- **A CI-repair or flake-classification verb.** Red CI routes to the heal seam (v1's
  `heal-ci` lane); this group reports `red` with the failing gating runs named on the notes
  channel and stops.
- **A flag-flip or release-execution verb.** Agents deploy, humans release.
  `ship release` ends at the label.
- **An approval-watcher / banked-§CP ledger verb.** The watch loop over parked §CP PRs is separate
  machinery with its own open decisions; building it into the merge verb
  group would freeze those decisions from the wrong side. `ship cp-approval` answers "now,
  at this head"; durable watching is not this group's.
- **A terminal-ledger composer verb.** The run report is the skill's own text under the
  terminal vocabulary; a composing verb would just relay strings the skill already holds. One
  rule reaches it from outside: any elapsed duration quoted in a ship report derives from two
  timestamps quoted in the same report — a pointer, not a verb.
- **A local-checkout sync or push verb.** This skill never touches local git (§RO); v1's
  `main-sync` / `verified-push` solve another lane's problem. Nothing here shells to git.
- **A repair-entry state machine for §CP.** What re-keys repair when a §CP advisory is stale
  and no current-head FAIL exists is an open decision — the residual left after the emit side was
  settled. The contract does not resolve it: a §CP FAIL posts and routes as an ordinary
  FAIL, and the residual stays named, not silently answered.

### Nothing here recomputes an enforced answer

Every question this group answers is ungated today: verdict-conjunction state, §CP approval
discharge, head-CI rollup shape, thread resolution state, queue terminal
classification, intent lifecycle, dark-ship detection. The enforced ones are listed above with
the workflow or ruleset surface that owns each, and this spec computes no second verdict on any
of them.

### The name situation

At authoring time v1's `ship-it` was still the live project-level skill, and the routing gap that
left was recorded for the sibling rebuilds. The cutover has since happened: the v1 plugin tree is
deleted and this skill, reached as `/fabrika:ship`, is the one merge authority.

The same applies to the **heal seam**: the skill routes red CI to `heal-ci`, and no fabrika
counterpart exists yet — until one ships, that route resolves to the durable stop note plus a
filed report for a human, and the gap is recorded here rather than patched by pointing at the
v1 lane.

## Shared conventions

Stated once rather than repeated per block.

- **Answer channel: machine.** Stdout carries the answer and nothing else; scope lines, refusal
  reasons, progress and notices go to stderr. Every "nothing found" case prints a state word —
  empty stdout is byte-identical to a verb that never ran, and v1's callers consumed exactly
  that as proof (the assert-bundle script whose *pass* was silence; the `NAME=value` lines
  whose absence was the refusal signal). **One outcome convention for the whole group**: exit
  `0` means "I produced the answer", whatever the answer is — `stop`, `red` and `ejected` are
  answers; non-zero means "I could not produce one", plus the enumerated proven refusals of
  the write verbs. v1 ran three outcome conventions at once and spent ~15 comment blocks
  re-teaching them per script; this group runs one.
- **Common inputs.** `--repo <owner/name>` (default: `$CLAUDE_PIPELINE_REPO`, else
  `$GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, else the `origin` remote; none resolvable → exit 1 — the resolution
  chain the shipped `report`/`triage`/`review` groups use, inherited for one config surface
  rather than a second vocabulary). `--json` swaps the line grammar for one object with the
  named keys.
- **`--sha` binds the answer to what the caller verified.** Verbs taking `--sha` accept 7–40
  lowercase hex and prefix-match it against the live head. Read verbs report a mismatch as a
  stderr notice and still answer at the given SHA (a moved head is a fact worth seeing at the
  read); write verbs refuse it on `12` (a mutation formed over one tree must not land on
  another). The empty-SHA degeneration is designed out at the type layer: an empty or
  malformed `--sha` is a usage error, never a matches-everything pattern — v1's
  `case "$H" in "$SHA"*)` collapsed to `*` on an empty capture, twice, in two different
  scripts, and a third time in the fold's unguarded `CURRENT_HEAD`.
- **Every list read paginates, reports its scanned count on stderr, and carries a completeness
  proof** — changed files, check runs, reviews, comments, threads, timeline events. **Which proof
  depends on what the platform declares, and a verb never prints a denominator it cannot derive**:
  - **A declared count, where one exists.** Changed files, check runs, workflow runs,
    issue comments and review threads all arrive with a total the platform states, so received
    short of declared is the `13` refusal, never a narrower answer — a timeline read that answered
    over 30 of N, and v1's silent 100-thread cap, are one defect wearing two symptoms.
  - **Exhausted pagination, where none exists.** The PR's **reviews** and its **timeline** arrive
    as bare arrays with no total at all, so `received <k> of <m>` over them has no derivable
    `<m>` — any `<m>` printed beside them was invented, and an invented denominator proves
    nothing. Their proof is a **terminal page carrying no `rel="next"` link**: seeing one is
    positive evidence every page is held, and a read that ends without one is the same `13`
    refusal. These reads walk pages explicitly and read the `Link` header rather than using
    `--paginate`, which concatenates bodies and drops the headers the proof lives in.

  Any
  aggregate computed over a paginated read is computed **after** the pages are joined — v1's
  per-page `group_by` picked a stale approval from page 1 and its per-page `length` printed
  `0\n0` — live in two v1 scripts.
- **A non-zero exit is UNKNOWN.** No verb prints a partial or permissive answer on a non-zero
  exit (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/verb.ts`'s answer-channel rule). No verb substitutes a
  fabricated count for an unreadable one — v1's empty-checkset probe printed invented
  fail-safe numbers indistinguishable from real ones; here an unreadable input is `11`.
- **`--json` shapes are normative as key lists.** The line-grammar examples are the byte-level
  contract; each verb's `--json` object is specified by its named-keys list — the object
  mirrors the lines one-for-one, and a second byte-level surface per verb would be a second
  home for the same facts. One canonical worked example lives on `ship scope`; the rest are
  key lists, deliberately.
- **Reads read; writes write.** No read verb posts a comment, mutates a label, or touches the
  PR (v1's CI rollup posted a PR comment from inside a read script — a caller that peeked at
  CI state mutated the conversation). Every write verb re-reads its target and verifies —
  v1's release-queue label POST and its nudge's reopen PATCH both reported success unverified,
  and each has a false-positive incident shape waiting in it.
- **`gh` exit statuses are read, always.** Every `gh api` capture checks the exit status
  before the bytes are interpreted; a failed read is `11`, never an empty string flowing
  onward. Roughly a third of v1's captures were unguarded, and every scar in this family
  (a failed boundary read read as "no owners", an empty `--sha` capture matching every head, the
  fold's empty head) is that one omission wearing a different symptom.

### The shared exit taxonomy

All the verbs allocate from one internal table, so a code means one thing across this
group. Where the codes overlap the shipped `report`/`triage`/`review` seats (`3`, `5`, `6`,
`7`, `8`, `9`, `10`, `11`, `12`, `13`) they are **imported from the shipped package**
(`packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/codes.ts`, `src/triage/codes.ts`, `src/review/codes.ts` —
the `review` group's `codes.ts` shows the import-not-restate idiom), never re-typed as
numerals and never read off a sibling contract.md — the checked-in `/report` contract is
behind its own binary on `7` and `11`, which is why prose copies are not the
authority.

| Code | Meaning | Verbs that can return it |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | the answer is on stdout — including `stop`, `red`, `ejected`, `n/a`: an answer, not an error | all |
| `1` | usage error, unresolvable repo, or the verb failed to run | all |
| `126` | no implementation could be resolved | all |
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing | `resolve`, `note` |
| `4` | *(deliberate gap — `report file`'s body-section seat; no verb here performs one)* | — |
| `5` | the **authored** text carries a machine-local path | `resolve`, `note` |
| `6` | the **authored** text is a bare `@` path reference — not redactable | `resolve`, `note` |
| `7` | zero scope: the target is **proven absent (404)**, or the PR is closed/draft where the verb requires an open one, or it has zero changed files — a fail-closed refusal | all except `disarm` |
| `8` | the write, or the read that confirms it, failed — the outcome is **UNKNOWN** | `resolve`, `enqueue`, `merge`, `disarm`, `nudge`, `note`, `release` |
| `9` | the write landed but the read-back does not match | `resolve`, `merge`, `note`, `release` |
| `10` | a supplied classification value is off the closed vocabulary — an unknown `--require` namespace, a bad `--site` | `gate`, `disarm` |
| `11` | a **precondition read failed** — nothing was proven and (for a write) nothing was written | all |
| `12` | refused: the live head moved past the inspected `--sha` — a mutation formed over a tree that is no longer the PR | `enqueue`, `merge`, `nudge` |
| `13` | refused: a read completed but its scope is **provably incomplete** — received short of a declared count, or (where the platform declares none) pagination never reached a terminal page. A changed-file list short of the pull-request record's own `changed_files` is **not** that proof: no verb in this group refuses on it any more — `scope`, `cp-approval`, `gate`, `floor` and `release` report it and derive from the list they read. A list at GitHub's own 3000-file ceiling **is** that proof, because the Link header ends there as a complete read ends | `scope`, `cp-approval`, `gate`, `floor`, `checks`, `threads`, `nudge`, `release`, `reconcile` |
| `14`, `15` | *(deliberate gaps — `review`'s ACL and append-only seats; no verb here performs either)* | — |
| `16` | refused: the target is **proven not in the state this write acts on** — nothing was mutated | `resolve`, `enqueue`, `merge`, `nudge` |
| `17` | refused: the nudge's close landed and the reopen is **unconfirmed — the PR may be left closed**; a human re-opens before anything else happens | `nudge` |
| `18` | refused: the diff touches a governance root and its `governance` verdict is **not** a head-bound PASS — `absent`, `stale` or `fail`. The one red that means *a human owes this PR a verdict*, kept off `16` so a CI job can tell it from "the floor could not be resolved" | `floor` |
| `19` | refused: the repository permits **no merge method at all** — squash, merge-commit and rebase are all disabled, so nothing can land directly. Its own seat rather than a fold into `16`, because the two route opposite ways: `16` sends the run to `ship enqueue`, `19` ends it at a human with repository-settings access | `merge` |
| `22` | refused: the PR was opened by an author outside the repo's own accounts and **no valid takeover grant** stands on it — it is its author's to land, and nothing was armed or merged | `enqueue`, `merge` |
| `23` | refused: a label this run would POST is absent from the repository's taxonomy — `plan flip`'s seat, imported, because both verbs prove one fact over one board's labels | `release` |
| `33` | refused: the verb is standing in the repository's **main working tree** — the driver's own checkout, not a worktree of the shipper's own — in a repo whose `shipScope.mainWorkingTree` is `refuse`, the shipped value. `lane push`'s seat, imported, because both prove one fact off one read (`standingInLinkedWorktree`, git's `--git-dir`/`--git-common-dir` pair) and `lane` already documents it as *the branch is in the wrong tree* | `scope` |
| `127` | the verb never ran (unresolved binary) | all |

**This matrix owns what a code *means*; the per-verb tables own what *triggers* it.** Every
verb can return `0`, `1`, `126` and `127` with the meanings above, stated here and nowhere else;
the per-verb "Exit status" tables enumerate only that verb's own proven outcomes, `3` and up,
phrased as that verb's trigger. (The one-fact-one-home rule; the `/triage` contract shipped the
ten-places drift this prevents.)

**`11` is the shipped `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN`**, matched rather than reinvented: a read the
verb needed failed, so nothing is proven — not `7` (which is *proven* absence: a 404 is a fact
about the repository, an unreachable GitHub is not a fact about anything) and not `1` (which
would fuse an unreachable GitHub with a bad flag). This group leans on the distinction harder
than its siblings because v1's worst incidents are exactly its collapse: a failed §CP read
reported as "awaiting approval", a failed file read reported as "no §CP, no classes", a 503 body
reported as "no artifact published".

**`16` and `17` are this group's own proven refusals.** `16` is the write-side state guard: a
nudge dispatched at a head that has runs, a resolve aimed at a thread that is not
positively bot-classed or is already resolved, a direct merge aimed at a queue-governed base or a
provably unmergeable PR — the verb proved the state and declined, which
is neither `7` (the target exists) nor `11` (nothing failed). It is the dropped-trigger fix made
structural: the verb that mutates re-derives its own precondition and refuses without
touching the PR. `17` exists because the nudge is the group's one two-legged mutation: v1's
unguarded PATCH pair could close a PR, fail the reopen, and still report "nudged" — a state
so much worse than a failed write that folding it into `8` would hide the one fact the
operator must act on immediately.

### Read-backs compare normalized text, not bytes

Every write verb re-reads its target and compares through **`normalizeForReadback` from
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/compose.ts`** — import it; its third step (strip trailing
newlines) is the one a re-derivation drops, and dropping it fires exit `9` on clean runs.

### Machine-local path detection

`ship resolve` and `ship note` share the leak predicate **already implemented** at
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/leaks.ts` — import it, never re-derive it. This is the
authored-text guard only; scanning *landed* content is `leak-guard.yml`'s enforced seam. A
note that must cite a leak cites it by class root or repo-relative form; the refusal message
says so. Two known open issues sit on this seam and are inherited, not resolved here: a body
that proves path-cleanliness *by example* trips the detector, which is generic by design, and no
verb can rewrite a comment another account authored; both route to a human, and the refusal text
names the class it hit.

## `ship scope`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ship scope 4321 [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number to scope |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. First line:
`scoped\t<head-sha>\t<open|draft|merged|closed>\t<issue-ref>` where `<issue-ref>` is
`fixes:<n>`, `part-of:<n>`, or `-` (none). Then one line per present artifact class —
`class\t<code|doc|skill|ui>\t<file-count>` — then one line per required namespace —
`namespace\t<review-code|review-doc|review-skill|review-ui|governance>` — then
`cp\t<control-plane|not-control-plane|unknown>`,
`landing\t<queue|direct|none|unknown>\t<squash|merge|rebase|->` and `files\t<scanned>`.

With `--json`: `{"outcome":"scoped","head":<40-hex>,"state":…,"issue":{"kind":"fixes"|"part-of"|"none","number":<n|null>},"classes":[{name,files}…],"namespaces":[…],"cp":…,"landing":{"path":…,"method":…},"scanned":<n>}`.

**Before any of that, this verb proves the checkout it runs in is not the repository's main working
tree**, and refuses `33` when it is: a shipper reads from a worktree of its own, never from the
driver's checkout, whose branch another seat can move mid-drive and so change which build of these
verbs the driver goes on executing. The remedy is to respawn the shipper in a worktree of its own;
the refusal names Claude Code's spawn flag for that, the Agent tool's `isolation: worktree`. The
fact is git's own `--git-dir` / `--git-common-dir` pair, read through
`lane`'s `standingInLinkedWorktree` (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/lane/assembly.ts`) rather than
re-derived here; a read that fails is `11` with nothing proven, never a pass. `ship scope` is the
seat because every shipper run carries it and nothing downstream proceeds without it, so one read
covers the group. Two callers are exempt, and both are exempt for the same reason — neither is the
dispatched shipper whose worktree this proves. `ship disarm --site preflight` runs earlier:
clearing a stale merge intent is safe from any tree, and refusing there would cost the run the one
act that protects it. `recipe unpark` calls this verb **in process** for the head, state and
namespace set behind its red-CI row, and a driver runs that verb from its own checkout on purpose —
it pushes nothing, stands on no lane branch, and telling it to respawn a shipper it never dispatched
would name the wrong actor for a park it can clear. The seat is stated at each call site rather than
inferred (`caller`, tagged `shipper` or `relay`, in `packages/fabrika-cli/src/ship/scope-verb.ts`),
so a future in-process caller picks an answer instead of inheriting one.

**A repo lifts that refusal for itself with one tracked config key.** `shipScope`'s
`mainWorkingTree` is `refuse` or `allow`, and ships as `refuse`, so a repo declaring nothing keeps
the `33`. A repo that keeps one checkout, or whose people ship by hand, declares
`"shipScope": {"mainWorkingTree": "allow"}` in `.fabrika.jsonc`; the verb then reads the pull
request from the main working tree and prints one notice naming the file that allowed it. There is
no command-line override. The key is read from the checkout the verb stands in, and only after git
proves that checkout is the main working tree, so a run in a linked worktree never opens it. A value
that does not decode, or a config file that cannot be read, is `11` with nothing read — never the
shipped `refuse`, which would hide a declaration the repo believes it made, and never `allow`. The
key is not machine-local: `.fabrika.local.jsonc` cannot declare it.

**A `merged` PR is an answer, not a refusal** — the skill reports idempotent success and ends.
`draft` and `closed` are likewise answers here; this verb reports state, the skill acts on it.
(The write verbs downstream refuse non-open PRs themselves — no verb trusts its dispatch.)

**The class map and the namespace derivation are one derivation, printed once.** The class
partition extends the `review` group's fixed map (code / doc / skill, `code` the residual —
same rows, same order, shared as one implemented module with `review scope`, never a second
copy) with the `ui` class: a changed path matching the repo's UI surface map (its source root,
excluding `*.test.tsx?` / `*.spec.tsx?`) additionally derives `review-ui`. Namespaces are
derived from classes by one table in one module; v1 printed the class set from one derivation
in one script and hand-copied it in another, and the copy dropped a class on a live PR. A
non-empty diff deriving an empty namespace set is refused (`13`-adjacent but
proven, so: the verb reds on `7`'s vacuous-conjunction arm below) — a merge gated on zero
gates is vacuously green.

**`governance` is appended to that set, not mapped from a class.** A diff with at least one
changed path under one of the repo's governed roots — `governedRoots` in `.fabrika.jsonc`, whose
shipped default names the decision corpus, the agent-config directory, the workflow directory
and the config file itself — additionally
derives `namespace\tgovernance`; a diff under none of those roots derives exactly the
namespaces it derived before, unchanged. Those paths already carry a file class, so this is a
second, orthogonal question about the same files rather than a fifth class — and the predicate
is the one `governance scope` computes, shared as code so the two cannot disagree. A namespace
`ship gate` can require but `ship scope` never names would be admissible-but-unreachable, which
is the fail-open half of one gap. The third leg is the reader: the `verdict-marker`
format admits the `governance` namespace, so a posted `governance: PASS @ <sha> — <clause>` from
an authorized author satisfies it at `ship gate` like any `review-*` marker. Required, emitted
and readable move together — a required namespace no marker can carry blocks every
governance-root PR permanently, which is the fail-**closed** half of that same gap.

**The roots and the `ui` prefixes are the PR's own.** `ship scope`, `ship gate` and `ship floor`
read `.fabrika.jsonc` at the PR's head and at the merge base the platform names for it, never off
the checkout the shipper stands in, and take the union: a path either commit governs is governed,
and a path under either commit's `uiSurfaces` raises `ui`. It is the reader `review scope` uses, so
the two sides cannot answer differently about one head — see the review contract.

**The `cp` line** is the three-state routing input (see "Considered and deliberately not
derived"), and its source is the **enforced artifact itself**: `.github/CODEOWNERS`, read at run
time from **the PR's base ref — the branch the PR targets**.
Naming a trunk branch literally was the bug: the base ref *is* that branch in the ordinary case, and
it is the honest generalization in a repo whose trunk is called something else. The property that a
PR must not reclassify itself holds unchanged, because the base ref is never the
PR's head. A changed path
covered by a CODEOWNERS row whose owner is a control-plane owner is `control-plane`. A
control-plane owner is `@<org>/<team>` **or** an individual `@<login>` — both parsed off the file,
never hardcoded. Individual owners count exactly as team
owners do: GitHub discharges a row when any
listed owner approves, and counting only team-shaped owners made every PR in a personal repo
`unknown` — the HOLD state — so nothing in it could ever ship. A bare email owner is not one:
it names no account a roster or an approval resolves against.
A change set with no owned-path match — including one entirely under
the decision corpus — is `not-control-plane`: a decision record is not control plane, and the
required `governance` verdict floor is what stands behind such a PR. A CODEOWNERS that reads fine
but is **trivial** — zero owned rows, or a row set that
covers everything — → `unknown` (a printed hold — a boundary matching everything and one built from
a trivial pattern both read as "everything is owned", which is not what either says).

**An absent CODEOWNERS and an unreadable one are different answers, and neither is
`not-control-plane`.** A **proven-absent** (404) boundary parses to zero rows and lands on the
`unknown` hold. An **unreadable** boundary is the absence of a fact rather than a fact, so it is
the `11` — unconditionally, in every repo. Here CODEOWNERS *is* the control-plane gate, and a
transient read fault shipping a control-plane PR unreviewed is exactly the failure this refusal
exists to prevent; collapsing `unknown` → `not-control-plane` is the recurring fail-open defect.
A per-repo `unreadableCodeowners` key briefly made this configurable; it was reverted, and nothing
reads the key now.

Deriving from CODEOWNERS rather than any prose or regex copy
means this verb and the merge gate read one artifact and cannot disagree; the
`codeowners-cp.yml` CI gate keeps that artifact in sync with the rest of the governance
surface. `unknown` is the one HOLD state, and the skill treats it as §CP until proven otherwise.

**The linked issue** resolves from the PR body's closing keywords (`Fixes/Closes/Resolves #N`,
first match), else an explicit `Part of #N` (an intentional partial split — the skill merges
without auto-close), else `-`. Which classes may ship issueless is the skill's law, not this
verb's.

**The `landing` line names which of the two landing paths this base branch has**, so the shipper
reads its route from one verb instead of composing it from two API reads nobody currently performs.
`queue` — a merge queue governs the base, so `ship enqueue` lands it and the method is the
queue's; `direct` — no queue and the repository permits at least one merge method, named beside the
path, so `ship merge` lands it; `none` — no queue and no permitted method, so nothing in this
repository can land this branch and a human owes it a settings change.

`landing` is **the one field that degrades instead of refusing**: an unreadable branch-rule or
repository read prints `unknown` with the reason on stderr, and the rest of the scope still answers.
That is deliberate and it is not fail-open, because this line licenses nothing — `ship merge`
re-derives the same fact from the same reads and refuses `11` exactly where this printed `unknown`.
Refusing the whole scope here would cost a run its head, classes and §CP state over a fact only one
downstream verb consumes, and that verb guards itself.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404); or the enumerated changed-file list is empty; or its non-empty diff derives zero required namespaces — a vacuous conjunction |
| `11` | the PR, its file list, the §CP boundary, the worktree fact, the merge base, or `.fabrika.jsonc` at the head or the merge base could not be read or decoded — the scope is UNKNOWN. Also, in the main working tree only, a `shipScope` this checkout's config could not yield. **Not** the landing read, which degrades to `unknown` |
| `13` | the changed-file list came back at GitHub's own 3000-file ceiling, where the Link header ends as a complete read ends — a class, a namespace or a §CP path could sit in the part the platform never served. The list against the pull-request record's `changed_files` is **not** that proof and no longer refuses here |
| `33` | the verb is standing in the repository's main working tree — the driver's checkout, not the shipper's own worktree — and the repo's `shipScope.mainWorkingTree` is `refuse`, declared or shipped.

**Scope** — on a shipper's own run, one `git rev-parse --git-dir --git-common-dir` in the checkout
the verb runs in, then one PR's metadata; the class config, which is one
`compare/<base>...<head>?per_page=1` for the merge base and `.fabrika.jsonc` through the contents
API at the head and at that merge base; the changed-file list, paginated to exhaustion; and one
boundary read from the PR's base ref. The checkout's own `.fabrika.jsonc` is read for one key,
`shipScope`, and only when that checkout is the main working tree; the classes never derive over it. The partition is
taken over that enumerated list rather than over the pull-request record's `changed_files`: GitHub
computes the record's count against a base it cached at the PR's last push, so a disagreement is
reported and never refused on. What still refuses is the list arriving at GitHub's own 3000-file
ceiling, where the endpoint stops serving files and ends its Link chain normally. The worktree read
is first and writes nothing. A class-config read that fails refuses `11` naming the commit and reads
no file list; a boundary read that fails refuses `11` on the spot. The partition is total over what
was read.

**Grounding**

- **One derivation, printed once.** A class set hand-copied into a second script dropped a class on
  a live PR; the vacuous-conjunction refusal is executable here, not five comment lines.
- **A failed file read is `11`.** It once answered "no §CP, no classes present" in one stroke.
- **The spawn flag is a request, not a fact.** A shipper dispatched with Claude Code's
  `isolation: worktree` ran in the
  driver's checkout; that checkout's branch then moved under a mid-drive operator, and the driver
  went on executing a different build of these verbs with no signal. One read, in the seat every run
  already carries.
- **The boundary is read from the PR's base ref**, and a trivial or empty boundary is a hold — a
  PR must not be able to reclassify itself, and "matches everything" is not "owned by everyone".
- **The class-map deadlock family.** Every changed file maps to a class, every class to a namespace
  some gate can actually emit; the map is shared code with
  `review scope`, so ship and review cannot disagree about what a file is.
- **Issue-linkage legality** (which classes may ship issueless) stays in the skill
  deliberately: this verb prints the facts (`class` lines, the `issue-ref`), and the mapping
  is one sentence of product law subject to future rulings — baking it into a verb would put
  a moving rule behind a rebuild.

## `ship cp-approval`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ship cp-approval 4321 --sha 03135b91 [--mergeability-seconds <n>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--sha` | string | yes | — | the head the run is shipping; every discharge signal must bind to it |
| `--mergeability-seconds` | integer | no | `60` | how long an indefinite `mergeable` is re-read before a would-be `stop` refuses as UNKNOWN |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. One line:
`cp-approval\t<discharge|stop|base-conflicted|n/a>\t<mechanism-or-reason>` where the third field is one of
`member-approval:<login>@<sha>` / `self-approval-marker@<sha>` (discharge),
`awaiting-approval` / `zero-owners` (stop), `mergeable-state:dirty` (base-conflicted), or
`not-control-plane` (n/a — the PR is proven ordinary and there is nothing to discharge).

`base-conflicted` replaces `stop` when no approval binds the head **and** a definite mergeability
read, through `ship/mergeability.ts`'s `readDefiniteMergeability` and `isBaseConflict`, says
`mergeable_state: dirty`. The shipper reports `BASE-CONFLICTED`, so the lane goes to a builder
rather than parking on a person asked to approve a head the rebase will replace. Mergeability is read
only where the answer would otherwise be `stop`: `discharge` and `n/a` never read it, and `ship
enqueue`'s own `21` still catches a `dirty` head after its approval, so no approval is spent. A
mergeability read that fails, or stays indefinite past the window, is `11` — whether the lane waits
on a person or a builder is then unknown, so neither answer is given. A stderr notice
`base-drift: head is <k> commits behind <base>` fires when the banked head is behind the live
base — the skill routes rebase → re-gate → re-bank *before* an approval is solicited, so the
approval is never spent on a head that must move.

With `--json`: `{"outcome":…,"mechanism":…,"sha":…,"roster":<n>,"baseDrift":<k|0>}`.

**The decision is the ruled cardinality table, verbatim:** roster = **the union of every owner
the CODEOWNERS control-plane rows name**, over both owner shapes. An `@<org>/<team>` owner is
expanded through the REST team-members endpoint (`/orgs/<org>/teams/<team>/members`, paginated),
read fresh once per named team. An individual `@<login>` owner **is** a roster entry and no roster
is read for it — that endpoint needs an org a personal repo does not have, which is why counting
only teams left such a repo unable to discharge the gate at all. The owner set is the same
derivation `ship scope` uses, one shared module, so the roster this verb consults is the set the
merge gate actually asks; the team name is parsed off the file, never
hardcoded. **The union is not a fabrika policy — it is GitHub's own any-listed-owner semantics**:
GitHub discharges a CODEOWNERS row when *any* listed owner approves, so a roster
narrower than the union would refuse approvals the merge gate accepts, and fabrika mirrors the
platform here rather than adding a rule of its own.
N=0 → `stop` `zero-owners`, or `base-conflicted` on a dirty head (an empty roster is a proven
stop; an *unreadable* roster for **any** named team is the `11` refusal, never a stop — a union
missing one arm is not a smaller union, it is an unknown one). A CODEOWNERS parse yielding
no control-plane owner of either shape at all is N=0 — `stop` `zero-owners`, and a **proven-absent**
CODEOWNERS reaches that same branch through its empty row set. An **unreadable** one is `11`, the
same answer `ship scope` gives it. N=1 and the sole owner authored the PR → discharge only on the
sole owner's head-bound self-approval marker comment (`control-plane-self-approval @ <sha>`,
a token deliberately outside every auto-merge namespace). N=1 non-author, or N≥2 → discharge
only on a non-author member's APPROVED review whose `commit_id` prefix-matches `--sha`. Every
signal is head-bound; a stale approval on a superseded head never counts (ruleset
`dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push` backs this but is not relied on — a patch-changing push has been
observed surviving dismissal, so the head-binding is checked here, always). Membership is a
three-outcome probe: active / proven-404 / UNKNOWN — an UNKNOWN member read is `11`, never
"not a member".

**Latest-per-author review resolution is computed after all pages are joined** — v1's
per-page `group_by` could surface a page-1 stale approval past a page-2 revocation — live in v1's
approval scan.

**Exit status**

|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404) or closed, or the enumerated changed-file list is empty — `classify` over no files answers `not-control-plane`, so a zero would render as a discharged boundary |

| `13` | the comment enumeration is provably short of the declared count, or the review read — for which the platform declares no count — never reached a terminal page, or the changed-file list came back at GitHub's own 3000-file ceiling, where the Link header ends as a complete read ends. The changed-file list against the pull-request record's `changed_files` is **not** that proof and no longer refuses here |

**Scope** — the control-plane roster (the union over every named team and every individual owner), the PR's changed
files (paginated to exhaustion) and comments (paginated, count-checked) and its reviews (paginated
to exhaustion), the live head, and — only where the answer would otherwise be `stop` — the PR's
`mergeable`/`mergeable_state`, re-read on a backoff for up to `--mergeability-seconds` while
GitHub still computes it. The boundary is classified over the enumerated file list rather
than over the pull-request record's `changed_files`, whose count GitHub computes against a base it
cached at the PR's last push — the disagreement is reported, an empty list refuses at `7`, and that
list at GitHub's own 3000-file ceiling refuses at `13`. `n/a` is a proven answer computed from the
same `cp` derivation `ship scope` prints (one shared module).

**Grounding**

- **The case table replaced judgment.** While this was a judgment call, identical single-owner PRs
  merged in one run and were refused in another; this verb is that table.
- **The empty-HEAD glob degeneration and the failed-read-as-"awaiting-approval" scar** are both
  designed out: a typed SHA, and `11` on any failed read.
- **Head-binding is checked here** rather than delegated to `dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push`,
  because a live counterexample showed a patch-changing push surviving approval.
- **The base-drift notice.** An approval spent on a must-move head is destroyed by the rebase —
  three control-plane approvals were lost in one night to exactly this.
- **The approval-aware gate and the cardinality table** this transcribes are ruled elsewhere; this
  verb transcribes them and decides nothing.

## `ship gate`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ship gate 4321 --sha 03135b91 --require review-code [--require review-doc …] [--cp] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--sha` | string | yes | — | the head every verdict must bind to |
| `--require` | string, repeatable | yes (≥1) | — | a required namespace; repeat the flag once per namespace, exactly as `ship scope` printed them. A **floor the verb may raise**, never a ceiling (see the governance floor below) |
| `--cp` | boolean | no | `false` | resolve §CP advisory carriers for the code namespace; pass iff `ship cp-approval` discharged |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. First line: `gate\t<satisfied|blocked>\t<sha>`. Then one line
per required namespace, in the order required:
`ns\t<namespace>\t<pass|fail|absent|stale|routed|unopened>\t<marker|advisory|review-fold|routed-elsewhere|->`
— the fourth field names which carrier produced the in-force verdict (`-` on `absent`). A
`routed` row whose record carries a basis gains a fifth field, `hand-check` or `skip`, and a stderr
line saying it was hand-checked or skipped by config, not rendered (see `routed` below).
`satisfied` iff every required namespace reads `pass` or `routed`.

With `--json`: `{"outcome":…,"sha":…,"namespaces":[{name,state,carrier,commentId[,basis]}…],"required":<n>}`.

**The flag-collapse and coverage scars are designed out at two layers.** `--require` is a
repeatable flag whose values accumulate — a single-valued parse that keeps the first and
drops the rest once made the gate say enqueueable past a live FAIL. And the
affirmative answer carries its own proof: before `satisfied` is printed, the verb asserts the
namespace lines cover exactly the distinct required set — a plausible value with silently
narrowed coverage is the defect's signature, so the assertion runs *before* the answer is
believed, not after.

**The `governance` requirement is the diff's floor, not the caller's option.** The verb reads the
PR's changed-file list itself, and a diff with at least one path under one of the repo's governed
roots gates on `governance` **whether or not `--require` named it** — the same predicate `ship
scope` prints the namespace from, over the same declared list, shared as code, so the two cannot
disagree. Every other namespace stays caller-asserted; the floor only ever *adds*, so a diff under
none of those roots requires exactly what it required before. When the floor fires, a stderr notice names it.

This is the whole ruling, and it is what a §CP row would otherwise have had to enforce.
The plugin tree is deliberately **not** control-plane — no CODEOWNERS row, no boundary
widening. The protection is this machine floor plus the §CP digest readout that carries every
plugin-tree landing to a human: **visibility after landing replaces blocking before it**, and the
trade is explicit — the readout makes a gate-weakening landing *visible*, not *impossible*, and the
machine chain has been observed missing one. `.github/**`, CODEOWNERS included, and everything
the existing §CP boundary already covers stay §CP, unchanged and enforced server-side regardless.

The floor is `governance` only. Deriving the whole `review-*` set here would be a second answer to
what `ship scope` already prints, and widening it is its own decision — recorded as considered, not
silently taken.

**In-force resolution, per namespace:** candidates are this namespace's verdict comments,
head-bound first (a live-head-bound verdict strictly outranks recency), then ordered
by the body's write-stamp, never `created_at` — a FAIL upserted after a PASS must win.
Authorization is the ACL rule: a verdict counts only when its author resolves to `write`+ on
the repo, fail-closed on lookup failure → that namespace is `11`, not `absent`.
With `--cp`, the code namespace additionally resolves the §CP advisory carrier (body-bound
`Reviewed-head:` + all-`[PASS]` rows — an advisory carrying any `[FAIL]` row is an invalid
emission, reported on stderr and treated as `fail`); the same `--cp` value must
reach every resolution in one run — v1 passed it to the gate and not the fold, and a
discharged FAIL stayed in force forever. Without `--cp` an advisory never resolves a namespace, but
an authorized one bound to `--sha` in a required namespace is named on stderr, newest per
namespace: the printed row then describes whichever older comment the other carriers left
(`stale`, `fail`, `pass` or `absent`), not the current verdict, and the notice says passing `--cp`
is what resolves it. No state or carrier token changes, and an unreadable ACL on such an advisory
is a notice, never `11`. The native-review fold is inside this verb:
a decisive native review (APPROVED / CHANGES_REQUESTED) whose `commit_id` prefix-matches
`--sha` folds into the code namespace newest-wins by write time — never FAIL-precedence,
which wedges the repair loop.

`absent` and `stale` are distinct tokens because their remedies differ (run the gate vs
re-run it at this head), and both block: a PR has been enqueued with no live-head verdict at all,
which is why absence is a refusal.

**`routed` is the fifth state, and it is a gate saying it owes this PR nothing.** It resolves from a
`routed-elsewhere` record — its own wire format, carrying no polarity, read through the same
head-binding and the same ACL as a verdict — and it satisfies beside `pass`, because the
conjunction asks whether every required gate has answered and "not mine to judge" is an answer.
**`review-ui` is the only namespace that may resolve this way.** It is the only gate whose emit path
is structurally unable to answer: `review-ui render` refuses zero surfaces and `review-ui post`
refuses without captures, so the `ui` class — raised off a path test that cannot see whether pixels
moved — named a namespace nothing legal could fill, and a prose-only PR under the UI surface map
was permanently unshippable. A record aimed at any other namespace is read and ignored; that
namespace stays `absent`. `ship floor` is unaffected — it asks for `governance` and requires `pass`.
A record `review-ui route --no-preview` posted under the repo's `reviewUi.whenNoPreview` rules
carries a `basis:hand-check` or `basis:skip` token, and the row keeps it: still `routed`, flagged so
a person can tell an owner's hand-check or a config skip from a render.

**`unopened` is the sixth state: a `review-ui` verdict counts only while its evidence opens.**
`review-ui post` never withdraws a verdict it has posted, so a verdict whose captures stopped
opening after the post stays on the PR. The gate therefore re-reads the in-force `review-ui`
verdict (marker or advisory carrier, `pass` or `fail`) before it counts it: the comment's rendered
HTML, each capture in the gallery above the supersede fence fetched anonymously through its signed
link, and held to the sha256 the gallery records beside it. A capture that does not answer `200`
with those bytes, or a gallery with no digest line, makes the namespace `unopened` — it does not
count, it blocks as `absent` does, and a stderr notice names each reason. A rendered read that
never reached GitHub is `11`, never `unopened`. The contract of the re-check lives with
[`review-ui post`](../review-ui/contract.md#review-ui-post).

**`--cp` is caller-asserted, deliberately** — the one input in this verb the caller vouches
for, an exception to the group's re-derive habit and stated as such. Gate is a read: a wrongly
passed `--cp` changes which *carrier* can satisfy the code namespace, never whether the §CP
approval itself is discharged — that discharge is `ship cp-approval`'s answer and is enforced
server-side (CODEOWNERS + ruleset) regardless. Re-deriving §CP-ness here would be the second
answer this contract bans.

**Exit status**

ceiling refuses at `13`, because exhaustion cannot tell that case from a complete read), its verdict comments (paginated,
count-checked) and native reviews (paginated to exhaustion), each candidate ACL-resolved; the class
config the floor's governed roots come from, which is one `compare/<base>...<head>?per_page=1` for
the merge base and `.fabrika.jsonc` through the contents API at the head and at that merge base,
never the checkout's; plus, for
an in-force `review-ui` verdict, that comment's rendered HTML (`GET issues/comments/<id>`) and one
anonymous fetch of each capture its gallery links. The verdict-marker and advisory grammars are the registered wire
formats (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/verdict-marker.ts`, `src/review/advisory.ts`) —
imported, never re-parsed; a hand-rolled marker regex is the drift the registry ended.

```
$ fabrika ship gate 4321 --sha 03135b91 --require review-code --require review-doc
gate	satisfied	03135b91

gate	blocked	7c31a0de
ns	review-skill	pass	marker
ns	governance	absent	-

**Grounding**

- **The governance floor.** `--require` was caller-asserted end to end, so a plugin-tree PR
  shipped with no governance verdict simply by never passing the flag; making the tree §CP was
  vetoed and the machine floor ruled instead.
- **The repeated-flag collapse and the coverage assertion**; both layers here.
- **The set-level absence check is not expressible as N separate reads**; one verb owns the
  conjunction.
- **Head-bound-first, write-stamp ordering, staleness** folded into one
  resolution rather than a separate marker test to keep in sync.
- **One `--cp` value for the whole resolution**; the seam that diverged in v1 is gone
  because the fold lives inside the same verb.
- **The advisory carrier's resolution rules**, including the
  forged-marker workaround this forbids and the PASS-only rule.

## `ship floor`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ship floor 4321 --sha 03135b91 [--publish-check] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--sha` | string | yes | — | the head the answer binds to (7–40 lowercase hex) |
| `--publish-check` | boolean | no | `false` | publish the answer as a check-run on the head instead of seating it on this verb's exit code |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel, and the two modes print different shapes.

Without `--publish-check`, two lines:

```
floor	<satisfied|n/a>	<sha>
ns	governance	<pass|->
```

With `--json`, an object with keys `outcome`, `sha`, `namespace`, `state` and `scanned`.

With `--publish-check`, three lines — the check-run the verb wrote comes first, and the floor and
namespace words are the raw ones the resolution carried rather than the exit-code mode's two:

```
check	<in_progress|completed>	<success|failure|->	<check-run id>
floor	<n/a|satisfied|blocked|unresolved>	<sha>
ns	governance	<pass|absent|stale|fail|->
```

With `--json` in that mode, an object with keys `outcome`, `sha`, `namespace`, `state` and
`checkRun` (`{id, name, status, conclusion}`) — **no `scanned` key**, because what this mode answers
is what it published.

**`n/a` is an answer about the diff, never a discharged verdict.** It means the changed files touch
none of this repo's governed roots, so the floor does not bind — and the verb says so on stderr, in
those words, because "the check was green" is exactly the reading that would make this gate
decorative for the diffs it does not cover.

<a id="publish-check"></a>
### The check-run mode: pending while nobody has judged this head

An Actions job concludes success, failure, cancelled or skipped and nothing else. While the floor was
seated on this verb's exit code, the ordinary mid-lane state — *no verdict posted at this head yet* —
showed the same red as a verdict that is FAIL or bound to another head. On 2026-08-18 five of six red
open PRs were red on exactly that, all healthy, and a red meaning "not yet" is a red people stop
reading. A check-run has the state a job conclusion does not: it can stay `in_progress`.

So `--publish-check` writes the answer to a check-run named **`governance floor at head`** — a stable
name, distinct from the job's — which needs a token holding `checks: write`, and this map is the
whole of it:

| Floor | Check-run | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `satisfied`, `n/a` | `completed` / `success` | nothing is owed |
| `absent` | left `in_progress` (**pending**) | nobody has judged this head yet; not wrong, not done |
| `stale`, `fail` | `completed` / `failure` | a verdict was formed and it is not a head-bound PASS |
| UNKNOWN (`7` / `11` / `13`) | `completed` / `failure` | UNKNOWN never passes and is not "still going" |

**The process then exits 0 whenever the check-run landed, whatever it said.** The floor's polarity is
the check-run's; a non-zero in this mode says only that the answer could not be published, which is
the one fact the job still carries. It seats `8` (the write failed), `9` (GitHub echoed a state this
run did not decide) and `11` (the head's check-runs could not be enumerated, so nothing was written),
all three this group's existing meanings — no exit code is repurposed, and every other caller of
`ship floor` is untouched.

**A pending check-run does not weaken the block.** `ship gate` is unchanged and still refuses while a
governance verdict is absent, `ship checks` rolls a pending gating run up as `pending` rather than
`green`, and a required check that is pending is not a passing one. What changed is what a human
reads, not what a merge is allowed to do.

**One row per head.** A check-run this head already carries is rewritten in place rather than stacked
on, so the PR shows one row. The exception is the backwards transition — a completed check-run being
re-opened as pending — which the platform will not model, because an update cannot clear a conclusion
it has recorded; that one posts a fresh check-run instead. A head whose check-runs cannot be read is
neither case: the verb refuses on `11` and publishes nothing, because "unreadable" read as "no row
here" is how one head ends up with two.

**What re-fires it.** Nothing new: `governance post` re-fires the floor run at the head it posted to,
and that re-run re-derives the floor and rewrites the check-run green. Since the job now succeeds
whenever it *published* an answer, that re-fire keys on the check-run's state rather than the job's
conclusion, and requests a whole-run re-run rather than a failed-jobs one.

<a id="the-mechanism-choice"></a>
### Why a caller verb, and not a new exit code on `ship gate`

The floor had to become **machine-binding**: CI must read the governance verdict on a governance-root
diff and red without it. Two mechanisms were on the
table and the choice decides whether `gate-verb.ts` changes at all. **The caller was chosen.**

- **Rejected — reseat `blocked` on the `3`+ proven-outcome band inside `ship gate`.** `blocked` is an
  answer the verb *produced*, and `../../docs/cli-interface-convention.md` reserves `0` for exactly
  that; moving it would break the convention's answer/refusal split for every caller at once — the
  `ship` skill's step 3, which reads the `ns` lines to route repair, most of all. A gate that
  refuses instead of answering also cannot report *which* namespace blocked, because `refuse()`
  hardcodes empty stdout.
- **Rejected — parse `gate\tblocked\t<sha>` in the workflow's `run:` step.** That puts the decision
  in bash, which is forbidden: a script relays a verb's answer and never derives the decision
  itself. It would also need a second step to decide whether the floor applies at all, and that step
  would be a second copy of the governed-root list that nothing reds when it drifts.
- **Chosen — `ship floor`, a caller verb whose refusal *is* the decision.** `ship gate` is untouched
  and keeps answering; `ship floor` asks it for the one `governance` namespace, reads the row back
  and seats a non-PASS on `18`. The workflow relays an exit code and derives nothing. The verdict
  resolution stays in one place, so there is no rival answer to drift.

`ship floor` is therefore **not** a second conjunction and **not** an enqueue decision — `ship gate`
remains the single merge authority. It reads one namespace, its own group's floor, and decides
nothing about the others.

### It refuses on WRONG, not only on MISSING

The recurring defect is a guard that fires when the guarded thing is *absent* and stays silent when
it is *present and wrong*. All four of these red on `18`, and each has a unit test:

| The PR carries | Resolves | Why it still reds |
|---|---|---|
| no governance marker at all | `absent` | the fail-open this verb closes: PRs have merged under a live floor with no verdict at all |
| `governance: FAIL @ <head>` | `fail` | a verdict was formed and it said no |
| `governance: PASS @ <other-head>` | `stale` | the PASS attests a tree that is not this one |
| `governance: PASS @ <head>` from an author without write+ | `absent` | the ACL gate drops it before the polarity is read |

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404) or closed, or the enumerated changed-file list is empty — whether it touches a governance root is unanswerable |
| `11` | the PR, its changed-file list, `.fabrika.jsonc` at the head or its merge base, or the conjunction underneath could not be read — the floor is UNKNOWN, never `n/a`. Under `--publish-check`, also: the check-runs at the head could not be enumerated, so whether this head already carries the floor's row is unknown and nothing is published |
| `13` | the changed-file list came back at GitHub's own 3000-file ceiling, where the Link header ends as a complete read ends — a governance root could sit in the part the platform never served. The list against the pull-request record's `changed_files` is **not** that proof and no longer refuses here |
| `18` | the diff touches a governance root and its `governance` verdict at this head is `absent`, `stale` or `fail` |
| `8` | **`--publish-check` only** — the check-run could not be written, so the floor is resolved and nothing published it |
| `9` | **`--publish-check` only** — the check-run landed and GitHub echoed a state this run did not decide |

**Scope** — one PR's changed-file list, paginated to exhaustion; the class config that says whether
the floor binds, which is one `compare/<base>...<head>?per_page=1` for the merge base and
`.fabrika.jsonc` through the contents API at the head and at that merge base, never the checkout's;
plus whatever `ship gate` scans for the one required namespace (its own file list, the same class
config reads, the comments, the reviews and the comment authors' ACL). Both scanned counts reach stderr, this verb's first. Neither verb refuses on that list
disagreeing with the pull-request record's `changed_files`: GitHub computes the record's count
against a base it cached at the PR's last push, so the disagreement is reported and the enumerated
list is the file set both derive from. What both still refuse on is that list arriving at GitHub's
own 3000-file ceiling: the endpoint stops serving files there and ends its Link chain normally, so
the exhaustion proof passes over a list the platform already cut short.

**Where it is enforced.** `.github/workflows/governance-floor.yml`, job `floor`, on every
`pull_request` with no `paths:` filter — the verb's own read of the changed files is the path
decision, so there is no YAML copy of the root list to drift. The job runs `--publish-check` and
relays what the verb did, deciding nothing. The queue's half of the same context is the `batch` job,
which runs [`ship floor-batch`](#ship-floor-batch) on `merge_group`. Making the `governance floor at
head` context **required** is a repository-ruleset change and therefore a human's; until it is, the
check is visible-but-not-blocking at the ruleset, which is a weaker state than the ruling asks for
and is recorded here rather than glossed.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ship floor 5237 --sha be0ece1aac259dd906e257529ce3294441f16e85
ship floor: scanned 8 changed files; 8 declared.
ship floor: #5237's diff touches no governance root, so the floor does not bind — this is an answer about the diff, not a discharged verdict.

```

```
$ fabrika ship floor 5481 --sha c9deb6047acc69da85b033a46b1fe05d2e0f5b91
ship floor: scanned 1 changed file; 1 declared.
ship gate: scanned 1 changed file; 1 declared.
ship gate: scanned 2 comments; 2 declared.
ship gate: scanned 0 reviews; pagination exhausted.
ship floor: #5481 touches a governance root and its governance verdict at c9deb6047acc69da85b033a46b1fe05d2e0f5b91 is absent — no authorized governance verdict at this head — run the `governance` skill and emit one with `fabrika governance post`.
$ echo $?
18
```

The same absent floor under `--publish-check` — the answer moves to the check-run and the process
exits 0 on having published it:

```
$ fabrika ship floor 5481 --sha c9deb6047acc69da85b033a46b1fe05d2e0f5b91 --publish-check
ship floor: scanned 1 changed file; 1 declared.

ship floor --publish-check: posted check-run 48812301 — the job's own exit code no longer carries the floor.
check	in_progress	-	48812301
floor	blocked	c9deb6047acc69da85b033a46b1fe05d2e0f5b91
ns	governance	absent
$ echo $?
0
```

**Grounding**

- **The substituted control did not bind.** `requiredWithFloor` was wired and correct, no
  workflow invoked `ship gate` at all, and `blocked` exited 0, so PRs merged with no
  governance verdict after the floor was live. The gap was the missing caller, not the floor.
- **A script relays a verb's answer and never derives the decision**; that is why the
  decision is a verb and the workflow step is one line.
- **A path filter matching nothing presents as a pass**, which is why this job has no `paths:`.
- **The write+ author gate and the SHA binding** are inherited from `ship gate`
  rather than re-derived, which is what makes an unauthorized or stale PASS red here.
- **An unreadable answer reds.** `11` and `13` are not softer than `18`; they are a different
  fact, and neither is a pass.

## `ship floor-batch`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ship floor-batch --sha 03135b91 [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--sha` | string | yes | — | the batch head — `github.event.merge_group.head_sha`, the commit that actually merges |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

There is no PR argument, and its absence is the point: a `merge_group` ref is not a pull request.
It writes a check-run, so its token needs `checks: write`, as the check-run mode of `ship floor` does.

**Output** — three lines, the same grammar the check-run mode prints:

```
check	completed	success	<check-run id>
floor	batch	<sha>
ns	governance	-
```

`batch` is the one floor word no diff produces. With `--json`, an object with keys `outcome`, `sha`,
`namespace`, `state` (always `null`) and `checkRun` (`{id, name, status, conclusion}`).

### Why the batch ref gets a pass, and what still holds the floor

A required status check is demanded on the queue's batched `merge_group` ref, and a workflow only
runs there if it carries a `merge_group:` trigger. `governance-floor.yml` had `pull_request:` alone, so when `governance floor at
head` was added to the ruleset's required set on 2026-08-21 the batch could never carry the context
and every queued merge in the repository hung toward the check timeout — a ~40-minute freeze, ended
by reverting the flip. It is the identical failure the always-on required context hit before it.

**This verb resolves no floor, because a batch ref carries nothing to resolve one from.** It has no
number, no changed-file list against the base a verdict was written over, no comments and no reviews.
`ship floor` reads all four, so on a batch it has no input at all — the pass here is the absence of a
question, not a question waved through.

**The floor is held where it always was, at the PR ref, by two independent things:**

- each PR in a batch was floor-gated at its own head by `ship floor --publish-check`, the `floor` job;
- `ship gate` — the single merge authority — refuses a governance-root PR whose `governance` verdict
  is `absent`, `stale` or `fail`, and the `ship` skill runs it before `ship enqueue` is reached.

**Why a verb and not a job named after the context.** A branch protection matches a required check by
name. Naming a `merge_group`-only job `governance floor at head` would satisfy the queue with no CLI
change — and would put a second copy of `CHECK_RUN_NAME` in YAML that nothing reds when it drifts
(a path filter matching nothing presents as a pass, and a workflow step relays rather than decides). It
would also stack a second check of that name on every PR ref, since a job skipped by its `if:` still
reports; a required context resolved from two producers is exactly the ambiguity this floor cannot
afford. So the name stays in one place and the workflow relays a verb.

**One row per head** and the read-back are `ship floor --publish-check`'s, shared rather than copied
— `publishFloorCheck` in `ship/floor-check.ts` is the single implementation.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `1` | usage: `--sha` is not 7–40 lowercase hex, or no target repository resolves |
| `8` | the check-run could not be written |
| `9` | the check-run landed and GitHub echoed a state this run did not decide |
| `11` | the check-runs at the head could not be enumerated, so nothing was published rather than a duplicate row |

There is no `18` here and no state that reds on the floor's own polarity: this verb has no polarity
to report. A non-zero means the context could not be published, which leaves the queue's required
check missing — it holds rather than merges, which is the fail-closed direction.

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `ship floor-batch: --sha "<raw>" is not 7-40 lowercase hex — an empty or malformed SHA is a usage error, never a pattern that matches every head.` | 1 | refusal |
| `ship floor-batch: cannot enumerate the check runs at <sha>: <reason> — nothing was published, so the floor stays UNKNOWN rather than posting a duplicate row.` | 11 | refusal |
| `ship floor-batch: the check-run could not be written: <reason> — the floor is resolved and nothing published it.` | 8 | refusal |
| `ship floor-batch: wrote <status>/<conclusion> to check-run <id> and GitHub echoed <status>/<conclusion> — what the PR shows is not what this run decided.` | 9 | refusal |
| `ship floor-batch: posted check-run <id> at <sha> — the batch carries the context; no floor was resolved on it.` | 0 | notice |
| `ship floor-batch: rewrote check-run <id> at <sha> — the batch carries the context; no floor was resolved on it.` | 0 | notice |

**Scope** — the check-runs already at the batch head, and nothing else. No pull-request surface is
read, and a unit test asserts that absence rather than assuming it.

**Where it is enforced.** `.github/workflows/governance-floor.yml`, job `batch`, gated
`if: github.event_name == 'merge_group'`. The `floor` job is gated to `pull_request` in the same
change, so a batch event can never reach it with an empty `github.event.pull_request`.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ship floor-batch --sha 03135b91aa04f7e2c9d8b1640a5c22e9f01b7d3c
ship floor-batch: posted check-run 48899104 at 03135b91aa04f7e2c9d8b1640a5c22e9f01b7d3c — the batch carries the context; no floor was resolved on it.

```

**Grounding**

- **The freeze.** Adding the context to the ruleset with no `merge_group:` arm on its producer
  froze every merge in the repository until the flip was reverted.
- **The queue's own rule** — "You **must** use the `merge_group` event to trigger your GitHub
  Actions workflow when a pull request is added to a merge queue"; `ci.yml` and `leak-guard.yml` are
  the in-repo precedents.
- **The check-run mechanism** this verb reuses, name and read-back included.
- **The workflow relays**; the name and the decision both live in the verb.

| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. First line:
`checks\t<sha>\t<green|red|pending|wedged|no-runs|no-producer>`. Second line: `run\t<count>` — the count
of latest-per-context check runs read (gating and informational both), the line channel's own
completeness proof. Then the **collapsed tally** of those runs, one line per class, count-descending
with ties broken on the class:
`check\t<success|failure|neutral|cancelled|skipped|timed_out|action_required|in_progress|queued|stale>/<gating|informational>\t<count>`.
`checks` is an evidence-array:
step 4 routes off the rollup and nothing reads a run by name, so the rows collapse to counts. The
gating axis stays inside the key because status alone would leave the rollup underivable from the
answer — a `red` head and a head whose only `failure` is an informational run would tally
identically. **The axis keeps its two words and changed its authority:** `gating` is a context the
base branch declares required, `informational` is every other, and the base branch answers it rather
than a name list in this package (`src/review/blocking.ts`). The two runs the skill's terminals read
by name are still **named**, on the notes channel, where the skill already reads them: the wedged
run, and — wherever a gating run has failed, which is `red` and also the `wedged` head that carries a
failure too — the failing gating runs, `ship checks: failing gating checks: <name>, … — route these
to heal-ci.`, name-sorted. Informational failures are excluded from that line for the same reason the
gating axis exists: they do not make the head red, and naming them there would send the operator to
`heal-ci` over a check that gates nothing.
Last line: `facts\tworkflows:<n>\truns:<n>` — `workflows` counts the repository's **active**
workflows (the inventory's `state == "active"` rows, nothing more: no trigger matching, no YAML
parser); `runs` counts the total workflow runs recorded at this
head across all workflows, **pre-dedupe** (which is why it can exceed the `run` line count:
that one counts latest-per-context check-run rows). These are the zero-checkset
discriminators (`no-runs` requires workflows ≥ 1 and runs = 0 at this head: Actions exist
and none fired — the dropped-trigger state `ship nudge` re-derives).

**A `green` is served only over bytes a gate of this repo's own inspected.** Where the
rollup would be `green`, the head's workflow runs are read against the active inventory through
`src/review/gate-coverage.ts` — the same module `review ci` refuses on, so the two gates cannot
drift a second copy of the rule. A workflow the repo checks in is addressed by its file path
(`.github/workflows/…`); one the platform provides on the repo's behalf is addressed
`dynamic/<provider>/<name>`, and that prefix is one of two discriminators: no expected job names, and
never `review ci`'s informational *name* denylist, which answers a different question. The second is
the run's own provenance — a run counts only where it carries this commit and its event is one
GitHub runs against the head. `pull_request_target` is the one that is not: it carries the pull
request's head and checks out the base, so `.github/workflows/pr-cleanup.yml` is repo-authored, sits
at the head, and inspected none of it. No other event is filtered, so `ci.yml`'s trusted
`workflow_dispatch` release path counts as any `pull_request` run does. The `--sha` operand is
resolved to its full object name first, because the Actions run list filters `head_sha` as an exact
string and an abbreviation there returns no runs at all; an operand that resolves to no full commit
is `11`, never the `20`. A head where the repo declares at least one workflow of its own and **none**
of them inspected it refuses on
`20` — `ship` is the merge authority, so "no gate inspected these bytes" must not read as "every
gate passed". Otherwise the coverage is stated on the notes channel: `ship checks: <k> of <m>
workflow(s) <repo> authors inspected <head>.`, or, for a repo that authors no workflow at
all, `ship checks: <repo> authors no workflow of its own — …`. The floor sits on `green` alone: a
`red` head already routes to `heal-ci` by name, and a `pending` head is one this group waits on
rather than lands.

**Only a context the base branch declares required may make this head red.** The declared set —
branch protection unioned with the rulesets whose ref condition matches the base — is read once per
invocation, before the first sample: it is a property of the branch this PR targets rather than of
the head, so a `--wait` poll never re-reads it. A failing check outside that set tallies as
`informational`, is named on the notes channel as `ship checks: failing outside the required set:
<name>, … — reported, never blocking.`, and does not red the head. A base branch that declares
**nothing** falls back to the informational-name denylist, so every non-informational check gates
there — an undeclared branch is one nobody has said what gates, not one that gates nothing. A
plan-gated base takes the same denylist: GitHub's `403` beginning `Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make
this repository public` says the branch cannot declare a required check, so it is not a permission
failure. Any other declared set that cannot be read at this token's permission is `11` naming that read as the cause:
this group is the merge authority, and no green here may be served over an authority nobody could
name. Which definition answered is stated on the notes channel on every run.

**A head that produced runs and no *blocking* run is `pending`, never `green`.** The rollup over an
empty set is green by construction — every run it was given concluded passing, there having been
none — and narrowing to the declared set opens that case wherever the required contexts have not
posted yet. What is missing there is a report, so the answer is `pending` with the reason on the
notes channel. The same rule covers the fallback definition's version of it, a head whose every run
is on the informational name list.

**A declared required context with no run is not satisfied either, however many others passed.** A
head where some declared contexts concluded `success` and one has posted nothing is `pending`, with
the missing contexts named on the notes channel; a `red` declared context still answers `red`. The
rule is read from `src/review/blocking.ts`, the same place `review ci` reads it.

**Zero workflows is `no-producer`, and it no longer collapses into `pending`.** A repo with
no CI and a repo whose CI has not reported yet are different facts, and printing the second over the
first tells an operator to wait for a run nothing will ever start. Workflow *existence* is the whole
test — nothing inspects what a workflow does — and only a repo-authored `.github/workflows/*` path
counts: the platform-provided `dynamic/<provider>/<name>` entries do not. That case refuses on `7` unless the
repo declares `ci.noProducer: "degrade"` in `.fabrika.jsonc`, which prints the `no-producer` rollup
at exit `0` with the fact on stderr. With `--wait`, progress goes to stderr and
the final stdout adds `settle\t<settled|budget-exhausted|head-moved>` before the first line's
shape is emitted at the terminal state.

With `--json`: `{"outcome":…,"sha":…,"rollup":…,"checks":{"<status>/<gating|informational>":<count>…},"workflows":<n>,"runs":<n>,"settle":…}` —
`checks` is the same tally the `check` lines carry, so the two channels cannot desync. `settle` is
`null` without `--wait` (the line grammar emits the settle line only under it).

**The rollup is total over the status vocabulary, fail-closed on the ambiguous rows** — the
same bucket rules as the shipped `review ci` (`red` on `failure`/`timed_out`/
`action_required`/`cancelled`; `pending` when any queued/in-progress; `green` only when every
declared run concluded `success`/`neutral`/`skipped`; unrecognized conclusion → `red`) —
**implemented as one shared rollup module with `review ci`** (`src/review/rollup.ts` ships
today; extend it, never fork it), plus this group's two additions on top: the
running-vs-wedged split (`queued` with a null `started_at` past the dwell → the whole answer
is `wedged`, with the stranded checks named — diagnosis only; the cancel-and-rerun lever is
an operator's) and the blocking-set narrowing (the base branch's declared required contexts, read
through `src/review/blocking.ts`, which the other three head-reading verbs call too; the
deploy/cleanup name denylist it falls back to is single-sourced in `src/review/rollup.ts`, never
duplicated — v1 hardcoded it in two scripts' jq and they drifted). The read is REST check-runs
latest-per-context — the GraphQL rollup lags ~15 minutes behind reality and refused green
PRs for it; the aggregate `.conclusion` is never bound (red-wins-over-pending masks
an unfinished gating check).

**`--wait` semantics:** re-read each cadence tick; budget accounts wall-clock including call
latency (v1 counted only sleeps and silently overran); a mid-wait `red` exits at the next
tick (falling through to green was the enqueue-a-red-PR hazard); a mid-wait head move exits
`head-moved` (the answer is about a tree the PR no longer is); budget
exhaustion is the `budget-exhausted` settle token with the last rollup — an answer, exit 0.

**Exit status**

**Scope** — the check runs and workflow inventory at one commit, paginated,
count-verified. Zero *declared* check runs with zero repo-authored `.github/workflows/*`
workflows is `green`-ineligible and `no-runs`-ineligible too — it is the repo that produces no CI
of its own, and what it costs is `ci.noProducer`'s answer. The platform-provided
`dynamic/<provider>/<name>` entries (default CodeQL setup, Dependabot, the Copilot reviewer) do not
make a producer. Under the shipped `refuse` it is exit `7`: a head whose checks will
never report is not a head to wait on. Where the repo declared `degrade` it is rollup
`no-producer` at exit 0, printed with `facts	workflows:<n>	runs:<n>`, where `workflows` counts
the whole active inventory — `dynamic/*` entries included — so it can be non-zero here. Neither arm greens, and
neither prints `pending` — that collapse is what made this state read as *wait longer* forever.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ship checks 4321 --sha 03135b91
checks	03135b91	green
run	3
check	success/gating	2
check	success/informational	1
facts	workflows:12	runs:14
```

```
$ fabrika ship checks 4322 --sha 9fe12ab0
checks	9fe12ab0	no-runs
run	0
facts	workflows:12	runs:0
```

```
$ fabrika ship checks 4323 --sha 7c04ef19   # a repo declaring "ci": {"noProducer": "degrade"}

facts	workflows:0	runs:0
```

```
$ fabrika ship checks 4324 --sha 5b1c0d72   # every check passed; only the base-context cleanup ran
ship checks: none of the 12 workflow(s) acme/repo authors inspected 5b1c0d7240e8c1a97be3f5d206c8a1394ef70b25 — the 2 check run(s) here came from elsewhere or from a run that opened another ref, so no gate inspected the bytes this merge would land: green is UNKNOWN, never merged.
$ echo $?
20
```

```
$ fabrika ship checks 4321 --sha 03135b91 --wait
settle	settled
checks	03135b91	green
run	3
check	success/gating	2
check	success/informational	1
facts	workflows:12	runs:14
```

(With `--wait`, the `settle` line leads the terminal-state emission; the rest of the shape is
unchanged.)

**Grounding**

- **REST latest-per-context over GraphQL**; the wedge split; the lever left human.
- **The `no-runs` facts line feeds `ship nudge`**, which re-derives them itself;
  this verb's copy is for the skill's routing, not the nudge's authority.
- **Informational contexts carved out in one module**; v1 kept two drifting jq copies.
- v1's settle-wait sourced its sibling script and could exit from its preamble with half its
  contract unprinted; a single verb with `--wait` has no preamble seam.
- **Deployed-service smokes stay out of the gating set**; merge gates are hermetic (ruled).

## `ship threads`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ship threads 4321 [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. First line: `threads\t<count>` (`0` is a valid, proven answer:
nothing unresolved). Then one line per unresolved thread:
`thread\t<id>\t<bot|human>\t<path:line|pr-level>\t<opening-author>\t<first-160-bytes-of-body>`.

With `--json`: `{"outcome":"threads","count":<n>,"threads":[{id,class,site,author,authors,excerpt}…],"scanned":<n>}`.

**Class is a whitelist computed over the whole thread, not its first comment.** A thread is
`bot` only when **every** comment author in it has GraphQL `__typename == "Bot"` — v1 classed
by the first comment alone, so a human's "no, this matters" reply on a bot thread stayed
bot-resolvable; here one human participant makes the thread `human`. Everything not
positively `Bot` — User, Mannequin, Organization, a null/ghost author, an absent field — is
`human` by construction, never by enumeration: no login-suffix inference, no allowlist of
known bots. `human` unlocks nothing; only positive `bot` reaches the skill's judgment, and
`ship resolve` re-derives this same class before it writes (the structural anchor).

**The read is the sanctioned GraphQL exception** (see Substrate) — and it paginates both
layers: threads *and* each thread's comments, count-proved. v1 read `first: 100` threads and
one comment, unpaginated: a 101st unresolved human thread was invisible to the merge gate.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404) |
| `11` | the thread read failed or the payload fails shape validation — whether unresolved threads exist is UNKNOWN, never `0` |
| `13` | the thread or comment enumeration is provably short of the declared count |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `ship threads: PR #<n> not found in <repo>.` | 7 | refusal |
| `ship threads: cannot read #<n>'s review threads: <reason> — UNKNOWN, never zero.` | 11 | refusal |
| `ship threads: received <k> of <m> threads — refusing the partial sweep.` | 13 | refusal |
| `ship threads: received <k> of <m> comments on thread <id> — refusing the partial sweep.` | 13 | refusal |

**Scope** — every review thread on the PR with `isResolved: false`, both pagination layers
count-checked, every comment author's `__typename` read.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ship threads 4321
threads	1
thread	PRRT_kwDOLxx1	bot	src/cart.ts:14	github-advanced-security	Unused import: `Effect` is imported but never used.
```

```
$ fabrika ship threads 4322
threads	0
```

**Grounding**

- **The bot thread that shipped past every gate**; the read this feeds is the gate's input.
- v1's 100-thread cap and first-comment-only class — both real gate holes, both designed out
  by whole-thread pagination and all-authors classification.
- **The `__typename` ground truth** (`github-advanced-security`,
  `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` are `Bot`), verified live in v1; the whitelist framing (only
  positive `Bot` unlocks anything) carried unchanged.
- `unresolved-threads-guard.yml` owns the *accounting* question (is every open thread named
  in the verdict); this verb never recomputes it — it answers "which, and by whom", the
  question the retained judgment consumes.

## `ship resolve`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ship resolve 4321 --thread PRRT_kwDOLxx1 [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

The rationale arrives on **stdin only** — no `--body`, no `--body-file`; a path flag is how a
machine-local path reaches a public surface while the poster reads success.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--thread` | string | yes | — | the review-thread node id to resolve |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |
| stdin | markdown | yes | — | the written rationale; it is the post-hoc audit trail and is not optional |

**Output** — machine channel. One line: `resolved\t<thread-id>\t<comment-url>`.
With `--json`: `{"outcome":"resolved","thread":…,"commentUrl":…}`.

**What the operation does, in order — each step gates the next:**

1. **Re-derive the thread's state and class** with the same read `ship threads` performs —
   never trusting the caller's dispatch. Already resolved, or not positively bot-classed
   (any non-`Bot` comment author), is the `16` refusal: the judgment this verb serves is
   scoped to bot threads by founder ruling, and the verb is that scope's enforcement — a
   confused caller cannot resolve a human's objection.
2. **Leak-scan the rationale** (`report/leaks.ts`, imported) — `5`/`6` as in the shared
   section.
3. **Post the rationale reply** to the thread.
4. **Fire the `resolveReviewThread` mutation** (the second half of the sanctioned GraphQL
   exception).
5. **Read back**: re-read the thread; require `isResolved: true` and the reply present
   (compared through `normalizeForReadback`). A resolve that trusts the mutation's response
   instead of the re-read is the trust-the-response defect this group bans everywhere.

Steps 3–4 are one logical write: a reply that lands without the resolve is reported by the
read-back as `9` with the state named (the thread keeps the rationale; a human resolves or
the verb is re-run — re-running is safe, the reply upserts by rationale identity rather than
duplicating).

**Deliberately no `--sha` and no `12` seat**, unlike the group's other write verbs: a thread —
unlike a verdict or an enqueue — is not head-bound, and step 1 re-derives the thread's LIVE
state at write time, so there is no stale carried observation for `12` to guard. The
head-sensitivity lives in the *judgment* (a nit because the diff already complies), and a
moved head re-enters at the skill's step 1 by the skill's own law.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing — a resolve with no written rationale is unauditable and refused |
| `5` | the rationale carries a machine-local path |
| `6` | the rationale is a bare `@` path reference |
| `7` | the PR or the thread is proven absent (404) |
| `8` | the reply post, the resolve mutation, or the confirming re-read failed — UNKNOWN what landed; re-read before retrying |
| `9` | the write landed but the read-back does not show the thread resolved with the rationale present |
| `11` | the thread's state or class could not be re-derived — nothing was written |
| `16` | proven: the thread is already resolved, or is not positively bot-classed — this verb only resolves bot threads; a human thread routes to its author |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `ship resolve: no rationale on stdin — a silent resolve discards an objection unauditably; write why.` | 3 | refusal |
| `ship resolve: the rationale carries a machine-local path at line <k> (<class>) — cite it repo-relative.` | 5 | refusal |

| `ship resolve: thread <id> not found on PR #<n>.` | 7 | refusal |

| `ship resolve: the read-back does not show <id> resolved with the rationale — inspect the thread.` | 9 | refusal |

**Scope** — one thread: its full comment list (for the class re-derivation), one reply
write, one mutation, one re-read.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ship resolve 4321 --thread PRRT_kwDOLxx1 <<'EOF'
Resolving: the unused import this flags was removed by the follow-up commit at this head.
EOF
resolved	PRRT_kwDOLxx1	https://github.com/acme/repo/pull/4321#discussion_r5154991
```

**Grounding**

- **The ruling that seats the judgment**: the nit-vs-substantive call stays in the skill;
  this verb is the mechanics under it, and its `16` is the ruling's structural anchor — the
  judgment is unreachable outside positively-bot threads.
- The ruleset's `required_review_thread_resolution` makes this the pipeline's only
  thread-clearing mechanism; the deadlock alternative (route to repair, which cannot resolve)
  was rejected on the same ruling.
- v1's resolve was a raw GraphQL mutation in prose, unverified; the read-back and the
  reply-then-resolve ordering (rationale first, so an interrupted run never leaves a silent
  resolve) are the rebuild.

## `ship enqueue`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ship enqueue 4321 --sha 03135b91 [--mergeability-seconds <n>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--sha` | string | yes | — | the head every gate verified; the arm binds to it |
| `--mergeability-seconds` | integer | no | `60` | how long an indefinite `mergeable` is re-read before it is called UNKNOWN |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. One line: `enqueued\t<sha>\t<queued|settling>` — `queued` when
the entry is already visible, `settling` when the arm landed and the queue entry has not yet
surfaced (the normal race; `ship reconcile` owns everything after this line).
With `--json`: `{"outcome":"enqueued","sha":…,"entry":"queued"|"settling"}`.

**The arm carries no merge-method flag, by construction** — there is no flag to pass: the
queue owns the method, and v1's documented hazard is that a `--squash` alongside `--auto`
conflicts with the queue and no-ops the enqueue silently at exit 0. The verb re-resolves the
live head first and refuses `12` on drift — the enqueue is the one action every gate's
`--sha` was protecting; arming at a moved head ships a tree nobody verified.

**A definite, mergeable `mergeable_state` is asserted BEFORE the arm.** The precondition
sits here and not in the post-arm confirm step, which already owns a different question (whether
the intent parked) and where an assertion would arrive after the write it was meant to prevent.
The residual window it closes is measured, not assumed: **probed live, GitHub accepts the arm on a
conflicted PR under a queue-governed base and parks the intent on it** — no platform-side refusal,
`mergeable_state` unchanged at `dirty` — so without this precondition a PR that cannot merge is
armed and reported as `enqueued … settling`, indistinguishable from a healthy arm.

The assertion and its indefinite-value handling are **one unit, and neither ships without the
other**: `mergeable` is computed lazily by GitHub, so a `null` / `unknown` read is routine and is
**not an answer**. An indefinite read is re-read across `--mergeability-seconds` (default **60**) on
a backoff — 2s, then doubling to a cap of 8s, the last wait trimmed so the waits sum to the window;
if it is *still* indefinite the answer is UNKNOWN and the verb refuses `11` with nothing armed. A
gate that read the indefinite value as green would be worse than no gate — a read that could not
produce a definite answer must never resolve to one. A read that *fails* is likewise `11`, never a
pass.

**The window is the whole fix for a conflicted PR reading as UNKNOWN, and the read path is not.**
GitHub computes `mergeable` in a background job that a read of `GET /repos/{repo}/pulls/{n}`
*starts*, and its own guide's procedure is to call that endpoint and then poll that same endpoint
until `mergeable` is true or false
([Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)).
There is no list read to fall back to: the REST list route carries no `mergeable` field at all, and
a live probe found the GraphQL list read answering `UNKNOWN` for 11 of 12 open PRs on a first read
and decided for all 12 on a second — the same lazy job, not a privileged route. What had been wrong
was the budget: three
polls two seconds apart gave that job six seconds, so a conflicting PR whose job had not landed
refused as UNKNOWN when one more read of the same endpoint would have said `dirty`.

**A definite `mergeable: false` refuses, and does not arm.** The premise this overturns
is that a definite `dirty` is an answer the arm may proceed on and leave to the platform's own error
discrimination on `8`. The platform issues no such error: it accepts the arm and parks the intent,
so the lane learns at `ship reconcile` what the read three lines earlier already proved, having spent
an enqueue round and one of its two retries to get there — measured on a live lane. The
refusal costs nothing a re-read cannot recover and is the same line `ship merge` draws on the same
shared read.

**That refusal splits by cause, on two codes.** `mergeable_state: dirty` is GitHub's word for a
merge that conflicts, so it is a fact about the **base** — it moved under the branch — and it
refuses `21`. Every other definite not-mergeable value is a fact about the head and keeps `16`. The
split is a code and not a state string because the caller picks a lane budget off it: `21` is
reported as `BASE-CONFLICTED`, which spends a machinery lap, and `16` as `ROUTED-REPAIR`, which
spends a repair round. A shipper that had to grep the refusal's prose to tell them apart would be
parsing a message to pick a budget.

**Neither code licenses this verb to move a branch, and `21` least of all.** The reading to refuse
here is that a clean rebase would leave the PR's verdicts standing, so `ship` could replay and
re-enqueue with no re-review owed. It would not: a verdict binds a content digest taken over the
three-dot diff from merge base to head, and every record in it names the **merge-base** blob as well
as the head's —
[`content-binding.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/content-binding.ts) says in its
own words that the binding *dies on base movement that reaches* a reviewed path, and a `dirty` state
*is* base movement reaching one. So every verdict on the PR is void, the re-review is genuinely
owed, the round is a builder's, and `21` changes what that round **costs**, never whether it
happens.

After the arm,
the verb reads the PR back: `auto_merge: null` **post-enqueue is expected** (the queue
consumes the intent) and is never read as a jam — the jam discriminator is the arm's error
response, quoted verbatim on `8`.

**A pull request belongs to its author.** After the live head is proven and before any read
that leads to the write, the verb reads whose PR this is — the same gate, on the same clauses, as
[`build claim`'s ownership gate](../build/contract.md#build-claim-build-confirm-build-release-build-adopt).
The PR may be landed when its author is in `.fabrika.jsonc`'s `ownAccounts` at the base ref (the
running, authenticated account alone when that key is absent, empty or unusable), or when a valid
[`takeover-grant`](../../docs/wire-formats.md#takeover-grant) marker stands on it — posted by an
account in the control-plane set `.github/CODEOWNERS` names, holding `write+`, who is not the
PR's own author. Anything else refuses on `22` and writes nothing; a read the answer depends on that cannot
complete is `11`. A PR whose author is ours costs the config read and, with no set declared, the
running account; the comments and a granter's permission are read only for a PR that is not.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404), closed, or already merged (an idempotent success belongs to `ship scope`'s answer, not to an arm) |
| `8` | the arm request, or its confirming post-arm read-back, failed — the error quoted; whether an intent is parked is UNKNOWN, so the caller runs `ship disarm --site refuse` before stopping |
| `11` | the live head could not be read, whose PR it is could not be read, the mergeability could not be read, or the mergeability was still indefinite at the end of the poll window — nothing was armed |
| `12` | the live head moved past `--sha` — every verdict upstream bound a tree that is gone; re-enter at step 1 |
| `16` | the PR is **provably not mergeable** for a reason other than a conflicted base — a definite `mergeable: false` read; nothing was armed and no enqueue round was spent |
| `21` | the base moved under the branch and the merge **conflicts** — a definite `mergeable_state: dirty`; nothing was armed. Report it as `BASE-CONFLICTED`, which spends a machinery lap instead of a repair round; the re-review is still owed |
| `22` | the PR is not ours and no valid takeover grant stands on it — nothing was armed. It is its author's to land; `fabrika build takeover` is how a trusted account hands it over |

**Scope** — one PR's live head, its mergeability (re-read until definite or refused), one arm
request, one read-back of the PR's merge state.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ship enqueue 4321 --sha 03135b91
enqueued	03135b91	queued
```

```
$ fabrika ship enqueue 4321 --sha 03135b91 --mergeability-seconds 120
enqueued	03135b91	settling
```

**Grounding**

- The method-flag no-op hazard (v1 SKILL step 4) — designed out by having no method surface
  at all.
- **`mergeQueueEntry --json` is rejected by shipped `gh`**; the entry read here is the
  REST shape `ship reconcile` shares.
- `auto_merge: null` post-enqueue is expected (v1 step 5's law); the jam discriminator is the
  error string, so the false-jam re-arm loop is unreachable.
- **This is the only verb that arms**; every other path is a disarm site.
- **The pre-arm mergeability precondition and its live probe**: the arm is not
  refused by the platform on a conflicted PR, so the gate is load-bearing rather than redundant.
- **The measured cost of arming on a definite `dirty` anyway**: a parked intent, an
  enqueue round, and one of a lane's two retries. The refusal is that evidence applied.
- **The measured cost of *charging* a definite `dirty` a repair round**: measured on a live lane,
  two of three retries went to two conflicts in twelve minutes each, with no defect in the diff
  either round.
  `21` and its `BASE-CONFLICTED` terminal are that evidence applied — the round still happens, and
  the budget that bounds how often a builder may fail a review is not what pays for it.
- **The poll window, sized against a live probe.** GitHub's own guide says to call
  `GET /repos/{repo}/pulls/{n}` to start the mergeability job and then poll that same endpoint until
  `mergeable` is true or false, and the REST list route carries no `mergeable` field at all — so
  there is no list read to prefer. A live probe found the GraphQL list read answering `UNKNOWN` for
  11 of 12 open PRs on a first read and decided for all 12 on a second, the same lazy job rather
  than a privileged route. The six seconds the old three-poll cadence gave that job is what refused
  a conflicting PR as UNKNOWN; 60 is what the probe's own settling time supports.

## `ship merge`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ship merge 4321 --sha 03135b91 [--mergeability-seconds <n>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--sha` | string | yes | — | the head every gate verified; the landing binds to it |
| `--mergeability-seconds` | integer | no | `60` | how long an indefinite `mergeable` is re-read before it is called UNKNOWN |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. One line: `merged\t<merge-commit-sha>\t<squash|merge|rebase>`.
With `--json`: `{"outcome":"merged","sha":…,"method":…,"mergeCommit":…}`.

**This is a second landing path, not a merge-method flag on the first.** `ship enqueue` argues,
correctly, that a method flag alongside the queue arm conflicts with the queue and no-ops the
enqueue silently at exit 0 — but that argument is entirely about a queue-governed base, and says
nothing about a base with no queue. Where no queue exists, `ship enqueue` had nothing to arm and no
other verb could land anything, so a lane in a consuming repo built, reviewed and gated correctly
and then stopped one inch short of shipped — observed on the first lane run outside fabrika's home
repository. The
method surface therefore lives here, on the path where the queue is **proven absent**, and
`ship enqueue` still carries none.

**The queue check is a refusal, never a fallback.** A base a merge queue governs is `ship enqueue`'s
and this verb refuses `16` pointing there — a direct merge into a queue-governed base walks past the
gate the queue exists to run. The regime is read off the **branch's** active rules, the same read
`ship disarm` uses, never this PR's queue history. An unreadable regime refuses `11`: this verb never
lands on a base whose regime it could not read, which is also what makes `ship scope`'s degraded
`landing unknown` safe.

**The method is read, never guessed.** The repository's `allow_squash_merge` /
`allow_merge_commit` / `allow_rebase_merge` decide it, preferring squash, then the merge commit,
then rebase. Squash leads because its default subject ends `(#<pr>)`, which is the anchor
`ship reconcile`'s base-branch cross-check proves a landing with; a rebase landing publishes the
branch's own subjects and that cross-check cannot see it. A repository permitting none of the three
refuses `19` — its own seat rather than a fold into `16`, because the two route opposite ways: `16`
sends the run onward to `ship enqueue`, `19` ends the lane at a human with repository-settings
access.

**A definite `mergeable_state` is asserted before the write**, on the same poll policy
`ship enqueue` uses and out of the same shared read — indefinite is re-read on a backoff across
`--mergeability-seconds` (default 60), and a value still indefinite at the end of that window is
UNKNOWN and refuses `11`. A definite `mergeable: false`
refuses `16`, the same line the arm draws, rather than sending a call the endpoint will
reject with a 405 that is indistinguishable, from the outside, from a write whose outcome nobody
knows.

**The landing is proven, not claimed.** The write hands the platform the **full** live head as its
`sha` parameter, so the platform rejects it if the head moved — a second drift guard under the
verb's own `12`. After the write, `merged` **and** the merge commit are read back off the PR: the
merge call's own response is the writer's claim about its own write, and a `merged: true` with no
commit behind it is a claim with no evidence. An unreadable read-back is `8` and never a success,
because whether the PR landed is exactly what is UNKNOWN there.

**A pull request belongs to its author.** After the live head is proven and before any read
that leads to the write, the verb reads whose PR this is — the same gate, on the same clauses, as
[`build claim`'s ownership gate](../build/contract.md#build-claim-build-confirm-build-release-build-adopt).
The PR may be landed when its author is in `.fabrika.jsonc`'s `ownAccounts` at the base ref (the
running, authenticated account alone when that key is absent, empty or unusable), or when a valid
[`takeover-grant`](../../docs/wire-formats.md#takeover-grant) marker stands on it — posted by an
account in the control-plane set `.github/CODEOWNERS` names, holding `write+`, who is not the
PR's own author. Anything else refuses on `22` and writes nothing; a read the answer depends on that cannot
complete is `11`. A PR whose author is ours costs the config read and, with no set declared, the
running account; the comments and a granter's permission are read only for a PR that is not.

**Scope** — one PR's live head, whose PR it is (the config at its base ref, the running account
and, for a PR not ours, its comments and a granter's permission), its base branch's active rules, the repository's permitted merge
methods, the PR's mergeability (re-read until definite or refused), one merge request, one
read-back of `merged` plus the merge commit.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ship merge 4321 --sha 03135b91
merged	5c7d1e930a2b4f6d8e0c1a3b5d7f9e1c3a5b7d9f	squash
```

```
$ fabrika ship merge 4321 --sha 03135b91
ship merge: a merge queue governs main — the queue owns the method and the landing; run `fabrika ship enqueue` instead.
$ echo $?
16
```

**Grounding**

- **The gap itself**: `ship`'s only landing verb armed a queue, so a repo with
  `allow_auto_merge: false` and `mergeQueue: null` had no verb that could land a PR, and every
  stage before the merge was already portable.
- `ship enqueue`'s method-flag argument, kept intact — the reason this is a second path rather
  than a flag on the first.
- **Arming is `ship enqueue`'s alone** and every other path is a disarm site; a direct
  landing arms nothing, so it opens no new disarm site.
- The `operate` skill names `ship` the pipeline's single merge authority and the merge into the
  default branch "the shipper's, once" — so the answer to a queueless repo is a verb here, not a
  driver reaching for `gh pr merge`.

## `ship reconcile`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ship reconcile 4321 [--polls 16] [--cadence-seconds 30] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--polls` | integer | no | `16` | classification attempts before the horizon |
| `--cadence-seconds` | integer | no | `30` | sleep between polls (between only — no trailing sleep) |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. One line:
`reconcile\t<landed|ejected|unresolved|parked>\t<polls-used>\t<horizon-seconds>`. All four
are proven answers at exit `0` — **`ejected` is an answer, not an error**, so no loop shape
around this verb can launder it into a success or a crash — v1's healthy KEPT path
exited 1 off a trailing conditional, and its reconcile loop's predicate could not see the
ejection marker. `unresolved` means the PR is still in the queue at the horizon, or armed and
not yet queued but younger than the floor below — neither a landing nor a failure; the honest words are the contract, and "auto-merges on green" is not in the
vocabulary. `parked` means the arm never entered a queue on a queue-governed base and has
waited past the floor: its latest `auto_merge_enabled` timeline event is at least
`ARM_SETTLE_FLOOR_SECONDS` (1200 s) old — the enqueue did not take effect. GitHub can hold a
live arm for minutes before it queues the PR (514 s has been seen), so a never-queued arm younger
than the floor reads `unresolved` at any `--polls`, `1` included, and the driver's
`ship:queued` re-reads carry it past the floor. An arm with no readable `auto_merge_enabled`
time is not held back by the floor.

With `--json`: `{"outcome":…,"polls":<n>,"horizonSeconds":<n>}`.

**Per-poll classification, precedence order, all signals REST + paginated:** `landed` on PR
`merged:true`, or on a base-branch squash whose subject **ends with** `(#<pr>)` (the
timeline lags the truth by up to ~65 minutes; the ending anchor is what keeps a subject naming
two pull requests from crediting the first one). `ejected` only on a timeline
`removed_from_merge_queue`
event **not paired** with a `merged` event — the queue consuming an entry emits the same
removal ≤1s before the merge, so reading the bare removal mints a false ejection.
`queued` on a live entry or an `added_to_merge_queue` newer than any removal. Anything
unreadable in a poll classifies that poll `pending` — a miss can only keep polling, never
mint `landed` or `ejected` (the fail-safe direction). The timeline read paginates **to a terminal
page**, and a read that never reaches one refuses `13` rather than polling on: a 30-event first
page read as the whole history has already produced a wrong terminal, and an unexhausted read is
that same hole with the pages joined.

**The horizon is stated, not defended:** default 16×30s ≈ 7.5 minutes of dwell against a
measured queue dwell of 5–10 minutes; `unresolved` at the horizon is the expected outcome of
a healthy long dwell, and the caller's report says so in those words. It stays there: a lane
that needs longer waits in the driver's `ship:queued` cell, which re-reads this verb at
`--polls 1` once a pass, rather than in a wider watch inside one shipper run. The verb never disarms
— it is a read; the skill fires `ship disarm --site ejected` / `--site post-enqueue` on the
`ejected` / `parked` answers (the sites exist precisely for these two answers, and the skill
text carries the pairing). Because the floor outlasts the default horizon, a readable arm's first
`parked` normally comes from the driver's `ship:queued` re-read, not the shipper's watch, so that
cell runs the same `--site post-enqueue` disarm before it records.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404) |
| `11` | every poll in the budget failed to read — the outcome is UNKNOWN, distinct from `unresolved` (which is a *successful* observation of a PR still queued, or of an unqueued arm still younger than the floor) |
| `13` | the timeline read — for which the platform declares no count — never reached a terminal page, and the classification would rest on it |

**Errors**

|---|---|---|
| `ship reconcile: PR #<n> not found in <repo>.` | 7 | refusal |
| `ship reconcile: every poll failed to read #<n>: <last reason> — the outcome is UNKNOWN, not "unresolved".` | 11 | refusal |
| `ship reconcile: the timeline read never reached a terminal page — pagination is unexhausted; refusing to classify over a truncated history.` | 13 | refusal |

**Scope** — one PR's merge state, timeline (paginated), and the base branch's recent
commits, re-read per poll.

reconcile	landed	3	450
```

```
$ fabrika ship reconcile 4322
reconcile	unresolved	16	450
$ echo $?
0
```

**Grounding**

- **Two v1 defects die here**: `ejected` is a first-class exit-0 answer the
  caller cannot miss, and no trailing conditional exists to launder a healthy exit.
- **The settle window, the paired-removal rule, the
  base-branch cross-check with its ending anchor, and full pagination**: the four
  wrong-but-plausible queue states the classifier must not emit, each of which has been emitted.
- **The horizon honesty rule and the banned vocabulary**, carried as contract.

| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. One line: `disarm\t<kept|disarmed>\t<site>\t<reason>` where
`kept` reasons are the closed set `merged` / `live-queued` / `not-armed` /
`pre-queue-regime` (a queue-less base branch where `--auto` *is* the merge mechanism —
post-enqueue only), and the `disarmed` reason is the single token `cleared` (proven by the
confirming re-read). With `--json`: `{"outcome":…,"site":…,"reason":…}`.

**The policy is fail-closed at every indeterminate probe:** an unreadable armed-state reads
armed (clearing a never-armed intent is a no-op; leaving a parked one is an ungated enqueue —
a parked intent has enqueued a PR within a second of an approval landing); an unreadable queue regime reads queue-governed (so a failed read
cannot grant the pre-queue keep); the regime is the **base branch's**, never this PR's queue
history (a per-PR proxy exempts exactly the parked intent this exists to clear). A `disarmed`
answer is proven by **re-reading `auto_merge` after the write** — the disable call's own exit
status fuses failure with nothing-armed and is never trusted. A live queue entry is never
disturbed (`kept` `live-queued`).

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `8` | the disarm was attempted and the re-read cannot confirm the intent is clear — the caller's report carries `merge intent: NOT cleared`; a failed disarm never rewrites the stop's disposition, only its report |

| `11` | the armed-state read failed before any write — whether an intent exists is UNKNOWN, nothing was attempted |

(No `7` seat: a disarm aimed at a merged or absent PR answers `kept` with the reason — the
intent is structurally moot, which is a proven answer, and refusing would make the safety
verb the fragile one on exactly the cleanup paths that need it.)

  fixed it with the re-read; the re-read is the contract here, the fused code never consulted.
- **Open:** what an *entry-path* refusal emits to the board is undecided; this
  verb keeps Site-1 mechanical and takes no position on the board signal.

## `ship nudge`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ship nudge 4321 --sha 9fe12ab0 [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--sha` | string | yes | — | the head whose zero-runs state is being remedied |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. One line: `nudged\t<sha>` — the close→reopen landed, both legs
verified, CI re-trigger now the platform's. With `--json`: `{"outcome":"nudged","sha":…}`.

**The verb trusts nothing it was told.** In order:

1. **Re-derive the precondition itself**: at `--sha`, zero check runs, zero commit statuses,
   ≥1 workflow with a matching trigger, PR open. Any of those reads failing is `11`; the
   state *proven otherwise* — runs exist, no workflows, PR not open — is `16`, refused
   without touching the PR — a mis-dispatched nudge has close→reopened a live green head
   and left a false comment on it; the caller's `ship checks` output is routing, never
   authority.
2. **Prove at-most-once per head**: count `reopened` events since the head commit's push
   date; ≥1 refuses on `16` (this head was nudged; a second nudge is escalation, not retry).
3. **Close, verify closed, reopen, verify open** — each leg read back. The close landing
   without a confirmed reopen is `17`, the loudest code in the group: the PR may be left
   closed, and the message says to reopen by hand *now*. The head ref is untouched by
   construction (close/reopen preserves it, so SHA-bound verdicts survive — the reason this
   remedy and not a rebase).

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404) |
| `11` | a precondition read failed — nothing was proven, nothing touched |
| `12` | the live head moved past `--sha` — the zero-runs state being remedied belongs to a tree that is gone |
| `13` | the timeline read for the reopened-event count never reached a terminal page — the platform declares no count for it, and an unexhausted history must not license a second nudge |
| `16` | proven: not in the dropped-trigger state (runs exist / no workflows / PR not open), or this head was already nudged once |
| `17` | the close landed and the reopen is unconfirmed — **the PR may be closed; reopen it by hand before anything else** |
| `8` | the close itself failed — nothing changed state |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `ship nudge: PR #<n> not found in <repo>.` | 7 | refusal |
| `ship nudge: cannot read <what>: <reason> — the dropped-trigger state is UNKNOWN; nothing was touched.` | 11 | refusal |
| `ship nudge: the live head is <live>, not <sha> — the state you diagnosed is another tree's.` | 12 | refusal |
| `ship nudge: #<n> is not in the dropped-trigger state (<why>) — refusing to touch it.` | 16 | refusal |
| `ship nudge: head <sha> was already nudged (<k> reopened events since push) — a second nudge is escalation, not retry.` | 16 | refusal |
| `ship nudge: the timeline read never reached a terminal page — pagination is unexhausted; refusing to count reopens over a truncated history.` | 13 | refusal |
| `ship nudge: the close failed: <reason> — nothing changed state.` | 8 | refusal |
| `ship nudge: the close landed and the reopen is UNCONFIRMED: <reason> — PR #<n> may be CLOSED. Reopen it by hand now.` | 17 | refusal |

**Scope** — one PR's check runs, statuses, workflow inventory, timeline (for the reopened
count), and the two PATCH writes with their read-backs.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ship nudge 4322 --sha 9fe12ab0
nudged	9fe12ab0
```

```
$ fabrika ship nudge 4321 --sha 03135b91
ship nudge: #4321 is not in the dropped-trigger state (14 check runs exist at 03135b91) — refusing to touch it.
$ echo $?
16
```

**Grounding**

- **The dropped `pull_request: synchronize` trigger** this remedies.
- **Self-derived precondition, refusal-without-mutation, and mutant-tested teeth** — all three
  grown after v1 trusted its dispatch once; here the shape is the verb's unit tests.
- v1's unguarded PATCH pair — close-succeeded-reopen-failed reported "nudged" with the PR
  left closed; `17` exists so that state is unmissable.

## `ship note`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ship note 4321 [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

The body arrives on **stdin only**.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |
| stdin | markdown | yes | — | the durable stop-path note: the terminal token and its reason, as the skill's terminal vocabulary phrases them |

**Output** — machine channel. One line: `noted\t<comment-url>`.
With `--json`: `{"outcome":"noted","commentUrl":…}`.

Leak-scanned (`report/leaks.ts`, imported), posted as a new comment (stop-path notes are a
history, not a state — each run's refusal is its own record), read back through
`normalizeForReadback`. A note on a closed or merged PR is legal — refusals happen at every
lifecycle stage, and the durable record is the point: a shipper that dies silently leaves no signal at all.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing |
| `5` | the body carries a machine-local path |
| `6` | the body is a bare `@` path reference |
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404) |
| `8` | the comment create, or its confirming re-read, failed — UNKNOWN whether it landed |
| `9` | the comment landed but the read-back does not match |
| `11` | the PR could not be read — nothing was posted |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `ship note: no body on stdin — a silent stop is the defect; write the reason.` | 3 | refusal |
| `ship note: the body carries a machine-local path at line <k> (<class>) — cite repo-relative.` | 5 | refusal |
| `ship note: the body is a bare "@" path reference — the bytes never arrived; pipe them.` | 6 | refusal |
| `ship note: PR #<n> not found in <repo>.` | 7 | refusal |
| `ship note: create failed: <reason> — UNKNOWN whether the note landed; re-read before retrying.` | 8 | refusal |
| `ship note: the read-back does not match — inspect comment <id>.` | 9 | refusal |
| `ship note: cannot read PR #<n>: <reason> — nothing was posted.` | 11 | refusal |

**Scope** — one PR, one comment write, one read-back.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ship note 4322 <<'EOF'
ship: refused — head CI red at 9fe12ab0 (`unit tests` failure). Routed to heal-ci. Merge intent disarmed at site refuse.
EOF
noted	https://github.com/acme/repo/pull/4322#issuecomment-5155001122
```

**Grounding**

- **Every non-enqueue path leaves a durable signal**; this verb is the signal's single
  sanctioned emitter, and a freelanced `gh api -f body=@file` is the bypass it closes.
- **Open:** the board-signal shape for entry-path refusals is undecided; this verb posts
  what the skill words and takes no position on that question.

## `ship release`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ship release 4321 [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number (merged or landing) |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. One line: `release\t<queued|n/a|no-issue>\t<flag-key|->` —
`queued` means the linked issue now carries the board's awaiting-release status (read back); `n/a`
means not a dark ship, a proven answer, third field `-`; `no-issue` means a dark-ship signal
FIRED and there is no linked issue to label — the flag key is printed and the skill
escalates to a human, because a dark ship the release queue cannot see is the exact hazard
this verb exists to prevent (never folded into `n/a`).
With `--json`: `{"outcome":…,"flagKey":…,"issue":<n|null>}`.

**Detection is three ground-truth signals over the PR itself, any one sufficient:** (a) the
diff adds a flag declaration (a `FlagshipFlag(` / `defaultVariation:` addition in the flag
registry module `ship release` names); (b) the PR body carries a
`Flag:` / `Flag key:` line with a kebab-case key (heading/bold tolerated); (c) the body names
a key **declared in that same registry file at the PR's base ref** inside a gating-context line
(fence-stripped, whole-token, gating-word-scoped — the context scoping is what keeps a prose
mention of an old flag from minting a phantom release). The linked
issue's inherited `Containment:` stamp is **never** read — it describes the epic, not this
PR, and reading it has queued a phantom release. No signal → `n/a`; a signal with no
linked issue → `no-issue` (see Output — a proven answer, never `n/a`).
The label write is read back; a failed or unconfirmed write is `8`/`9`, never `queued` —
v1's unverified label POST could report a release queued that no human would ever find.
The label is the board's awaiting-release status: `status:awaiting-release` unless
`.fabrika.jsonc` renames it under `boardVocabulary.statuses.awaitingRelease`, read before the pull
request is, so a board vocabulary that does not resolve is `11` on every path.
The write is taxonomy-guarded first: that label absent from the repo's labels
refuses on `23` rather than let GitHub's POST mint it, and the taxonomy is read
only on the path that would post — `n/a` and `no-issue` read none.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404), or the enumerated changed-file list is empty — a zero carries no declaration to find, and `n/a` there would be a dark ship nobody queued |
| `8` | the label write, or its confirming re-read, failed — UNKNOWN; the release queue may be missing a real dark ship, say so loudly |
| `9` | the label write landed but the read-back does not show it |
| `11` | `.fabrika.jsonc`'s board vocabulary, the diff, body, flag registry, or linked issue could not be read — dark-ship-ness is UNKNOWN, never `n/a` |
| `13` | the changed-file list came back at GitHub's own 3000-file ceiling, where the Link header ends as a complete read ends — a flag declaration could sit in the part the platform never served. The list against the pull-request record's `changed_files` is **not** that proof and no longer refuses here |
| `23` | the board's awaiting-release status is absent from the repository's taxonomy — refused rather than let the POST mint it; guarded only on the path that would post, so `n/a` and `no-issue` read no taxonomy |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `ship release: PR #<n> not found in <repo>.` | 7 | refusal |
| `ship release: cannot read <what>: <reason> — whether this is a dark ship is UNKNOWN, never "n/a".` | 11 | refusal |
| `ship release: label write failed: <reason> — a real dark ship may be missing from the release queue; escalate.` | 8 | refusal |
| `ship release: label read-back does not show <name> on #<issue> — inspect it.` | 9 | refusal |
| `ship release: PR #<n> has zero changed files — whether it carries a flag signal is unanswerable, and "n/a" would be a dark ship nobody queued.` | 7 | refusal |
| `ship release: GitHub's file list for #<n> holds <k> paths against the <m> its own pull-request record declares — the record's count is computed against a base cached at the last push; reported, never refused on.` | 0 | notice |
| `ship release: GitHub's file list for #<n> came back at its 3000-file ceiling, so the list is provably partial — a flag declaration could sit in the part the platform never served.` | 13 | refusal |
| `ship release: label "<name>" is absent from <repo>'s taxonomy — refusing to create it. A real dark ship is not queued; run `fabrika status bootstrap label-taxonomy` and re-run.` | 23 | refusal |
| `ship release: cannot read <repo>'s label taxonomy: <reason> — nothing was written, and a real dark ship is not queued; escalate.` | 11 | refusal |

**Scope** — one PR's changed-file list (paginated to exhaustion), its diff and body, the flag registry
file at the PR's base ref, the repository's label taxonomy (read only when a write is due), one
linked issue's labels; one label write with read-back. The scan runs over the enumerated list rather
than over the pull-request record's `changed_files`, whose count GitHub computes against a base it
cached at the PR's last push — the disagreement is reported, an empty list refuses at `7`, and that
list at GitHub's own 3000-file ceiling refuses at `13`.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ship release 4321
release	n/a	-
```

```
$ fabrika ship release 4330
release	queued	vote-widget
```

**Grounding**

- **Agents deploy, humans release**; the label is the seam and the whole
  action.
- **The phantom release from the inherited containment stamp**; the stamp
  is unread by contract.
- **Signal (c)'s coverage and its context scoping**: the reused-flag miss
  and the prose-mention phantom, both named so the implementer keeps both edges.
- v1's unguarded label POST and `|| true`-blanketed registry read — the false-positive and
  silent-miss shapes this verb's `8`/`9`/`11` exist for.

## Where the eight under-determined clauses were ruled

This spec once left eight clauses under-determined, and all eight have since been ruled. Each ruling
is stated at its own site above, so **nothing on this list is open** and a run has nothing to surface
here. Two of the eight were ruled by the maintainer directly and six were delegated; the record of
which is which lives in the repository's own history, not in the plugin's text.

| Clause | Grade |
|---|---|
| 1 — the completeness proof for reads with no declared count | delegated |
| 2 — what `facts workflows:<n>` counts | delegated |
| 3 — the auto-merge porcelain carve in Substrate | delegated |
| 4 — the ref the CODEOWNERS read uses | **maintainer-direct** |
| 5 — `failed` as the fifth evidence state | delegated |
| 6 — the 120s freshness window and its clock | delegated |
| 7 — the roster when CODEOWNERS names more than one team | **maintainer-direct** |
| 8 — the pre-arm mergeability precondition | delegated |

Clauses 5 and 6 ruled the SHA-bound bundle reader this group once carried. That verb retired when
`ship checks` became the whole of ship's CI trust, and both clauses retired with it.

A clause this spec leaves genuinely open is marked **Open** at its own site instead; two are, both
under `ship disarm` and `ship note`.

## The eval-enumeration obligation (leaf rule)

Stated once, in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md)'s "Eval enumeration" section — the single home that
obligation lives in. This spec adds nothing to it; the eval mechanics are their own ticket.
