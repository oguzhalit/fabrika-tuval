# `/plan-epic` — derived CLI contract

**Skill:** [`plan-epic`](SKILL.md) · **Date:** 2026-08-09

The verbs land in `packages/fabrika-cli/` under the **`ledger`** subcommand group, registered in
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/registry.ts` like the shipped groups, every leaf declared via
`leafCommand` (`src/excess-operand.ts` — a bare `Command.make` silently opts out of the
excess-operand guard, and `excess-operand.unit.test.ts` reds on it). The
[CLI interface convention](../../docs/cli-interface-convention.md) governs every verb; where this
spec and that doc disagree, the doc wins and this spec is the bug.

**`fabrika` calls `pipeline-cli` nowhere, and neither does the skill** — a verb whose whole body
relays another tool's answer is not a verb. The v1 machinery named below —
`claude-plugins/kampus-pipeline/skills/plan-epic/scripts/`, and under
`packages/pipeline-cli/src/tools/`: `epic-lock/`, `epic-splice/`, `epic-ledger/`, `intake-compose/`,
`intake-dedup/`, `scratchpad/`, `homing-guard/`, `reachability-guard/` — is prior art **read** for
semantics and scars; none is invoked, wrapped, or deferred to. Every v1 module name cited in this
spec is **non-normative**: the behavior it informs is restated here in full, and an implementer
needs none of those files to build these verbs.

**The group name.** `ledger` is this skill's, following the one-group-per-skill precedent
(`build-ui` took `ui`, `check-epic-plan` took `plan`, each reusing
`build`'s verbs rather than sharing its group). `plan` is occupied at `main` and does not answer
this skill's question: its four verbs read, gate and flip a plan that already exists. (`epic` was
occupied too, by the eight verbs that conducted a run over an already-gated plan; that group is
retired and an epic's children now drive through `operate` on a `lane emit` machine.)
**Authoring is unoccupied** —
nothing shipped creates an issue with a full classification, links a sub-issue, or composes a
`## Dependencies` or `### User stories` block.

**One disambiguation, because the word is overloaded in this package.**
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/lane/store.ts` calls its append-only `events.jsonl` a "ledger". That is
the *run* ledger. This group's `ledger` is the **plan** — the noun this contract and
[`check-epic-plan`](../check-epic-plan/SKILL.md) both use for an epic's decomposed task list. The
two never meet: no verb here reads or writes a lane's run ledger.

**What fabrika already ships, reused — never respecified.** The claim is the **`build` group's,
reused as landed verbs** ([`build`'s contract](../build/contract.md)) — the cross-contract shape
`build-ui` sanctioned: this skill claims the epic with `fabrika build claim --purpose plan`, proves
its ground with `fabrika build tree`, releases with `fabrika build release`, and posts a successor
note with `fabrika build note`. The purpose is part of the reuse, not a detail of it: `build claim`'s
audience axis asks whether an agent should pick the issue up to *build*, and an epic earns
`ready-for:agent` only after this skill has planned it and the gate has passed it, so a `plan` claim
is admitted without it, so `21` is not
reachable under `plan`, and `--override` stays the exception it was.

**The grilling session is the `grill` group's, reused the same way**
([`grilling`'s contract](../grilling/contract.md)). Every epic is grilled, with no size threshold
and no opt-out, before the plan reaches the epic body; the skill's step 4 runs it with
`fabrika grill open --ticket <epic>`, `grill round`, `grill answer` and `grill read`, between
`ledger draft` and `ledger write` (before `ledger child`, so the `NEEDS-INPUT` exit really does mint
nothing). **This adds no `ledger` verb, no plan section and no exit code**, and it is why: the
session issue, its round grammar, the `fact`/`decision` split enforced at `grill answer`'s `17`, the
ACL-gated ruling and the closed-set frontier all already exist and are already tested. Deriving a
second question-and-answer record here would put two records on one conversation.

**The session is where the grill runs; the epic is where it is kept, and that placement is a
governing rule, not a preference.** The questions and the answers are posted as comments on the epic
issue, because that is where anyone reading the epic later already looks. Reusing
the `grill` group puts the working thread on a session issue, so step 4 mirrors the settled grill
back onto the epic through `build note` — question, kind, answer or ruling, and the session number.
Stated here because the two are easy to confuse: the reuse is a mechanism choice this contract may
make, while *where the record lands* is not, and a cross-link alone would have quietly
moved it. Nothing is derived to enforce the mirror — see the paragraph below.

**No `ledger` verb proves the grill happened**, and nothing here derives one. The ordering — a
session opened, a round posted, the frontier read, the grill mirrored, *then* `ledger write` — is
convention the skill holds, stated at its `GRILL-IS-CONVENTION` anchor. A verb that read the session before splicing
would be this group deriving a verdict about a `grill` artifact, which is the same second-answer
defect that keeps the structural floor out of this group; it would also make an absent session a
`ledger write` refusal, seating a code for a fact the founder's approval checkpoint owns.

**No second lock is derived**, and v1's `epic-lock` is why: all five of its
distinct outcomes collapse onto exit `1`
(`packages/pipeline-cli/src/tools/epic-lock/command.ts:26,43-47`), it `POST`s the
`status:planning` label *before* the claim comment so a failed claim leaves a held label with no
owner (`github.ts:64-66` — "a human clears it"), and `release` re-finds "our own" claim **by
session id**, so a sibling lane's release retracts the holder's claim. Modules reused by import:

- `packages/fabrika-cli/src/io/issues.ts` — `resolveRepo`, `getIssue` (three-way
  `Present` / `Absent` (404 only) / `Unknown`), `httpStatusOf` (the status-not-stderr-text split
  that makes `7`-versus-`11` decidable), `listComments`, `splitJsonArrays`, `listLabels`,
  `listOpenMilestones`, `addLabels`, `setMilestone`, `patchIssueBody`.
- `packages/fabrika-cli/src/build/dependencies.ts` — `readTopology`
  (`Parsed` / `Absent` / `Unparseable{line,text}`), `predecessorsOf`, `sameRef`, `renderRef`.
  **This spec adds no second `## Dependencies` grammar**; it composes a block the shipped parser
  reads back, and `ledger topology` proves that round trip.
- `packages/fabrika-cli/src/plan/ledger.ts` — `unfencedLines`, `sectionCount`,
  `readEpicStories`, `readChildStories`, `readContainment`, `USER_STORIES_HEADING`,
  `STORIES_FIELD`, `CONTAINMENT_FIELD`. The gate's reader is this skill's **validator**: composing
  against anything else is how a planner writes a ledger its own gate rejects.
- `packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/acceptance-criteria.ts` — the total three-armed read
  (`Found` / `Absent` / `Malformed`), fence-aware. `ledger child` validates each composed child
  body through it. The wire registry already pins this format as the contract between a planner's
  output and the gate's input.
- `packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/leaks.ts` (`scanBody`, `isBareAtReference`, `renderLeaks`) and
  `src/report/compose.ts` (`normalizeForReadback` — **three steps; read the body, the docblock
  understates it**). Every verb that authors public text imports both.
- `packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/dedup.ts` — `rank`, `tokenize`, `renderCandidate`, and the
  three-valued `Outcome` (`candidates` / `none` / `indeterminate`). `ledger open` imports it.
- `packages/fabrika-cli/src/plan/github.ts` — `listSubIssues` (the epic's native sub-issue list,
  paginated, typed-JSON decoded) and `probeCycleDoc`. `ledger open` imports both rather than
  growing a second reader of the same endpoint; the *write* half of the sub-issue relation does
  not exist anywhere and is derived new by `ledger child` and `ledger supersede`.
- `packages/fabrika-cli/src/build/claim.ts` — `requireSession` and `requireClaim` (this session holds
  it, proven now); the claim nonce comes from `src/build/lane.ts`'s `nonceOf`. Every verb runs `requireClaim`; the nonce is the run key.
- `packages/fabrika-cli/src/build/tree.ts` — `assertGround`; and
  `src/build/target.ts` — `resolveTargetRepo`, `openIssue` (pre-seats the `7` / `11` refusals),
  `badNumber`, `scannedLine`.

A restatement of any of these would be a transcription, and a transcription drifts. The spec says
*import this*, with the path.

**Considered and deliberately not derived** — each already enforced or owned elsewhere (interface
convention rule 6; conventions §7 homes these in `.out-of-scope/`, unbootstrapped — tracked inline
as the sibling contracts do):

- **A milestone-homing check.** `homing-guard` is the one v1 tool of the eight in field 4 that
  fires at a CI seam — `.github/workflows/homing-guard.yml`, job `check`, on `issues`
  label/milestone events plus a weekly cron. The skill **states the expectation** (a child is
  homed or standing-lane exempt) and computes no second answer, because a planner that told an
  author "homed" while the guard reds is worse than one that stays quiet.
- **The structural floor.** `fabrika plan check` is the whole pass/fail decision over the
  fifteen hard defects, and it is [`check-epic-plan`](../check-epic-plan/contract.md)'s. This
  group derives no second verdict; `ledger draft`, `ledger child` and `ledger topology` each
  validate *the document they are composing* so a defect is caught at authoring time, which is a
  different question from grading a finished ledger.
- **A flip to the board's triaged status.** The gate's, unconditionally. No verb here writes it.
- **A pickability predicate.** `build`'s picker question, and still open there.
- **A reachability check.** `reachability-guard` answers a flag-graduation question at the
  `/release` seam; nothing in planning needs it, and its v1 shape is pinned to one app's paths.
- **A convergence / re-plan loop.** v1 exported `runConvergenceLoop` and registered it as no
  command at all. A defective plan is re-planned by re-running this skill, not by a verb that
  loops.
- **A planning lock, a repo resolver, a scratch opener, a link confirmer.** All four exist in v1
  as scripts whose entire body relays an upstream answer (`resolve-repo.sh`, `scratch-open.sh`,
  `epic-lock-release.sh`, `confirm-links.sh`). A relay-only verb is not a verb.

## Verb inventory

| Verb | Purpose | Split test |
|---|---|---|
| `ledger open` | prove the ground fresh, allocate the run, read what already exists, rank duplicate candidates | fetch + freshness proof + a registered ranker — no judgment; *whether a candidate really is this work* stays in the skill |
| `ledger draft` | validate and stage the model-authored plan block | a total grammar check over a closed section set; *whether the plan is any good* is irreducibly the skill's |
| `ledger child` | mint one child with every birth attribute in one create, link it, re-read it, record it | a guarded write with a read-back; *what the child should contain* is the skill's, taken as input |
| `ledger adopt` | bring an already-filed issue into the plan as a child: validate it with the gate's readers, append only the field lines it owes, park it on `status:planned`, record it, link it | the gate's readers plus an append-only write with a two-halved read-back; *whether the issue really is this plan's work*, and its story ids, are the skill's, taken as input |
| `ledger topology` | validate the declared edges against the recorded children, prove every out-of-epic prerequisite, and render the block | a total function from edges to a verdict over one boundary read per external ref — cycles, non-child subjects, a prerequisite naming the epic itself, orphans and an absent external target are all decidable; *which slices may run in parallel* is the skill's |
| `ledger write` | splice the staged plan and topology into the epic body, byte-verified | anchor resolution + a guarded PATCH with a round-trip diff — no judgment |
| `ledger edges` | write the epic's written `## Dependencies` block into the native `blocked_by` graph, reconciling rather than replacing | a total derivation from the block to the pairs it owes, plus a guarded write with a read-back — no judgment; *what the topology should be* was decided at `ledger topology` |
| `ledger supersede` | retire a child the re-plan no longer contains | an ordered three-leg write with a read-back; *which child to retire* is the skill's |
| `ledger defer` | take a child out of the plan and leave its issue open as the follow-up | an ordered two-leg write with a read-back; *whether to defer* was the founder's |
| `ledger retopology` | rewrite the `## Dependencies` block from the live child links, so a descope stops wedging `lane emit` | a total derivation from the live child set to a block, plus a guarded PATCH with a round-trip diff — no judgment; *which child to descope* was the founder's |
| `ledger digest` | print the live body digest `--body-digest` takes, staging nothing, so the repair route needs no plan run | one hash of one body — no judgment at all |

**Considered and not derived: a `ledger validate` verb** that pre-runs the gate's floor. It would
compute a second answer to a question `fabrika plan check` decides, which is the `adr classify`
test the pilot dropped a verb on.

## The ledger grammar this skill WRITES

`check-epic-plan` specifies the grammar it **reads**; this section specifies what this skill
**emits** into that grammar, byte for byte, because a planner and its gate disagreeing on a
separator is a defect neither can see alone. Where the two documents describe the same field, the
gate's reader is authoritative and this composer is held to it by the imported modules above.

**The epic body, after a successful `ledger write`:**

```
## Pitch

<pitch>

## Epic — awaiting plan

`plan-epic` appends its plan and dependency topology below.

<!-- fabrika:enriched issue=3 mode=wrap -->
<details>
<summary>Original brief (verbatim)</summary>

<original>

</details>

## Plan (plan-epic)

<the staged plan block>

## Dependencies

- phase 1: #4, #5
- phase 2: #6
- #6 requires: #4
```

**The plan region is located by the enrichment marker, never by position.** Detection is the
verb-written `<!-- fabrika:enriched issue=<N> mode=<rewrite|wrap> --> ` line, matched whole-line
(`packages/fabrika-cli/src/triage/enrich.ts:41`), which is one mode-independent rule closing both
the position axis and the mode axis at once. **The marker is what makes position free**: with it
doing the detecting, appending the plan below the brief envelope breaks no detector, so a
wrap-last layout inversion, its coupled changes and its legacy migration are all unnecessary.
Making the `--epic` envelope independent of a splicer's anchor set is thereby **moot** as a
remedy — the anchor set is no longer what locates the region.

**Plan block — the closed section set.** `## Plan (plan-epic)` followed by exactly these `###`
headings, each present exactly once, in this order:

`Summary` · `Problem & who has it` · `What changes` · `User stories` · `Goal / non-goals` ·
`Resolved questions` · `Approach` · `Acceptance criteria` · `Testing strategy` ·
`Task-split rationale` · `Vocabulary impact`

**`### User stories` is an ordered list and the leading integer is the story id** — the gate's
`readEpicStories` collects ids only from ordered-list rows, so an unordered bullet or an `S3`
label yields *zero stories* and the whole plan reads as declaring none. Ids must run contiguously
from 1 with no repeats.

**`### Acceptance criteria` is the epic tail's contract, and it carries the same bytes a child's
does** — `- [ ] ` checkbox rows, the first one directly under the heading with **no blank line
between them**, outside every fence and every `<details>` block. It is read back through the same
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/acceptance-criteria.ts` every grader reads, so a section of prose
under that heading is refused at authoring time rather than discovered by a tail reviewer who then
has nothing to grade. An epic body carrying no such block leaves `review criteria <epic>` refusing
on every tail, which is the state this section exists to close.

**Child body — composed, then validated through the imported readers:**

```
**Stories:** 1, 2
**TDD:** yes
**Containment:** flag (default-off)

### What to build
<prose>

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] <observable, externally checkable criterion>
```

Byte rules, each one a v1 scar designed out: the three field lines are consecutive with no blank
between them; exactly one blank line before `### What to build` and before
`### Acceptance criteria`; **no blank line between `### Acceptance criteria` and its first
bullet**; criteria are `- [ ] ` checkbox rows; a single trailing newline.
**`**Stories:**` carries bare integers only**, and the composer refuses a value that is not `none`
or a comma-separated integer list. The refusal is worth having because **v1** harvested every digit
run in the value, so a value carrying a parenthetical ticket reference silently claimed a story id
no epic declared. The downstream gate does not repeat that: it reads a non-conforming value as
*absent* and reports it in `detail`. Refusing at authoring time is what keeps the two from
disagreeing. `**Containment:**`'s **leading keyword** is one the repo's `containmentVocabulary`
declares, or the reserved `none`; a trailing parenthetical is preserved verbatim (`flag
(default-off)` is the ordinary form), and the field is emitted **only** when the cycle-doc probe
reads `present` — v1's documented spec template omitted the field entirely while its skill body
required it, so an author following the template dropped it on every child and the tolerant read
made "forgot" indistinguishable from "no cycle doc".

**`## Dependencies` — the rendered block.** It is a picture of the plan's shape for a human reader
and **nothing gates on it**: blockedness sits behind GitHub's native `blocked_by` edges alone, and
`build eligible` no longer parses this block at all. Exactly the two line forms `readTopology`
parses, and nothing else: one `- phase <n>: #<ref>[, #<ref>…]` row per phase, phases ascending and
members ascending within a row, then one `- #<ref> requires: #<ref>[, #<ref>…]` row per child that
declares a prerequisite, ascending by subject. There is no `###` heading inside the section, no
label column, no parenthesized clause and no `---` rule — `readTopology` breaks at the first heading
of any level **or** the first thematic break (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/build/dependencies.ts`), so
a `### Phase <n>` line would end the scan on the line after `## Dependencies` and the block would
read back as zero edges: a well-formed, plausible, always-wrong answer the gate then reads as an
epic every one of whose children is orphaned. The thematic break is the same boundary an appended
amendment's separator draws, which is why one below the block leaves the block itself intact. The
block ends with a trailing blank line so a later heading stays separated. The illustrated block
above is the round trip this grammar buys — pasted into `readTopology` it parses to the three edges
it depicts (`phase 1: #4, #5`, `phase 2: #6`, `#6 requires: #4`), never the empty set, which is what
lets `ledger topology` stage instead of refusing on `24`.

## The body digest

`ledger open` prints a **body digest**: the first **12 lowercase hex** of the SHA-256 of the epic's
body text, taken after `normalizeForReadback`. `ledger draft` and `ledger write` **require** it as
`--body-digest`; each re-reads the live body, recomputes, and refuses on `21` if it differs.

**The digest covers the body text and nothing else, and that scope is the invariant the group
rests on.** Walked against every write this contract makes:

| Write | Touches the epic body text? |
|---|---|
| `ledger child` — create issue, add labels/milestone/assignee | no — a different issue |
| `ledger child` — link as sub-issue | no — `sub_issues` is a separate relation; the body is untouched |
| `ledger topology` — render into the run directory | no — it reads each external prerequisite and writes nothing |
| `ledger supersede` — comment, unlink, close the child | no — a different issue |
| `ledger write` — PATCH the epic body | **yes, and it is the only write that does** |
| `ledger edges` — POST each missing `blocked_by` edge | no — a native relation on the children; the body is untouched, which is why it may run after `write` |

So the digest taken at `open` still binds through minting, topology and supersede, and is consumed
by the single body write. `ledger edges` runs after that write and takes no digest at all, because
it writes no body text and its own guard is the graph read-back. **The digest is void afterwards**:
a second `ledger write` in one run is not a
supported operation, and a caller that re-uses a spent digest gets `21` rather than a silent
double-splice. Unlike the sibling gate's scope digest this one is deliberately *not* neutral to
its own guarded write — the write is terminal, so neutrality would buy nothing and would require
excluding the very bytes being verified.

**Normalizing before hashing is a scar fix, not tidiness.** v1's splice round-trip compared raw
bytes while its only caller captured stdout through command substitution, which strips every
trailing newline before the PATCH — so what GitHub stored was never what was emitted and the
comparison was structurally unwinnable. Hashing the normalized form makes a trailing-
newline round trip a match instead of a false `21` on every clean run.

## Shared conventions

Every `ledger` verb obeys these; stated once.

- **Answer channel: machine.** Stdout carries the answer only — one JSON object with named keys.
  Scope lines, refusal reasons and notices go to stderr. **A non-zero exit prints nothing on
  stdout** (`src/verb.ts`: `refuse()` hardcodes an empty stdout, `answer()` hardcodes code `0`).
  **The positive answer is always a positive token** — a dedup read that found nothing prints
  `"outcome":"none"`, never empty stdout, because v1's dedup made "no duplicates" and "refused to
  run" byte-identical on stdout while exiting `0` for both.
- **A proven verdict is a state word at exit `0`.** Where a verb's answer has arms, both exit `0`
  and the discriminator is on stdout, per interface convention rule 3's pipe clause. Guards sit at
  the **write**, never at a caller's reading of a prior exit code.
- **A 404 is a verdict; anything else is UNKNOWN.** Absence is decided by the HTTP status the API
  returned via `httpStatusOf`, never by matching text against `gh`'s stderr. No message in this
  contract is worded "does not exist, or is not readable".
- **A flag whose absence must be a *semantic* refusal is optional at the parser and refused in the
  verb body.** A parser-required flag's absence is exit `1`, indistinguishable from a typo
  (`triage/command.ts:78-85` is the shipped precedent). `--ready-for` on `ledger child` is the one
  case here: its absence is a decision nobody made, which must be provable as `10`, not
  guessable as a typo. **This does not apply to `--body-digest`, `--child` or `--title`**, whose
  absence is an ordinary usage error with no semantic content — those stay parser-required, and
  their fail-open risk is a *wrong* value, which is `21` and `10` respectively, not a missing one.
- **Stdin is read through the imported `io/stdin.ts` three-way `Text` / `NoStdin` / `Failed`.**
  `Failed` is `1` ("the input is UNKNOWN, never empty"); `NoStdin` and an all-whitespace `Text`
  are `3`. The two must never collapse: a non-blocking pipe throws `EAGAIN` before its producer
  writes, and swallowing that to `""` makes an unread pipe byte-identical to an empty one.
- **The run directory is keyed on the claim nonce, never the session.** `runKey(epic, nonce)` →
  `<treeRoot>/.fabrika-plan/<epic>-<nonce>/`. Every sibling subagent of one session shares the
  session id, so a session-keyed namespace collapses exactly the isolation two parallel planning
  lanes need. Every file inside it is named for what it holds — no fixed leaf shared across runs.
  The shipped precedents are `build/scratch-verb.ts:33` and `ledger/run.ts:31-36`.
  **It is kept out of git the way `ledger` already does it** — `ledger open` appends the literal line
  `.fabrika-plan/` to `.git/info/exclude` if absent (`ledger/run.ts:29`'s `EXCLUDE_ENTRY`, written by
  `ledger/open-verb.ts:251-258`).
  That file is per-checkout and untracked, so the exclusion never enters a diff and never fights a
  `--require-clean` check.

- **The run directory holds four files, and they are the reason nothing is remembered:**

  | File | Written by | Read by |
  |---|---|---|
  | `run.json` — `{"epic","run","mode","cycleDoc","bodyDigest"}` | `ledger open` | `draft`, `child`, `adopt`, `topology`, `write`, `supersede` |

  **`bodyDigest` on `run.json` is a record, never an input.** `draft` and `write` compare the live
  body against the `--digest` **flag** and nothing else; a verb that fell back to the recorded value
  when the flag was absent would compare the plan against itself and make the moved-epic check
  vacuous. The field is there so a successor reading the directory can see what scope the run was
  opened over.
  | `plan.md` | `ledger draft` | `write` |
  | `topology.md` | `ledger topology` | `write` |
  | `children.jsonl` — one line per child | **seeded by `ledger open`** with the epic's existing children, appended to by `ledger child`, a line recorded or replaced by `ledger adopt` | `adopt`, `topology`, `supersede` |

  `mode` and `cycleDoc` are decided **once**, by `ledger open`, and every later verb reads them from
  `run.json` rather than being told. A verb that re-derived `mode` from a live body could disagree
  with the `open` that named the run, and a `cycleDoc` carried in the model's head is the deferral
  the completeness test forbids. A `run.json` that is absent or unparseable is `11` — the run is
  UNKNOWN, never assumed `fresh`.
- **Common inputs.** `--repo <owner/name>` (default: `resolveRepo`'s precedence — `--repo`,
  `$CLAUDE_PIPELINE_REPO`, `$GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, then the `origin` remote) on every verb. That
  variable name is **inherited from the shipped `io/issues.ts`**, not minted here. GitHub access
  per [skill conventions §11 — REST, never GraphQL](../../docs/skill-conventions.md),
  paginated in full — v1's idempotency read used `per_page=100` with no `--paginate`, so in any
  repo past a hundred open issues its duplicate check was mostly blind and failed by re-minting.
- **Bounded fan-out, where there is any.** Two verbs fan out and both do so at concurrency **8**,
  never `"unbounded"`; a rate-limit response must not abort the whole read, which is how v1's
  sixty-child epic failed. `ledger open` reads every existing child of the epic, and `ledger edges`
  reads one `blocked_by` list per dependent the topology names. **No other verb fans out over a
  set**, so no other verb needs the rule: `child` mints one child, `supersede` retires one child
  (touching the epic only to unlink it), and `topology` writes nothing at all — it reads the epic
  once for the shared preconditions and derives everything else from the manifest. There is deliberately no
  partial-batch reporting anywhere in this group — a non-zero exit prints nothing on stdout, so a
  verb that half-succeeded across N children could not tell its caller which N, and the design
  answer is not to write such a verb.
- **Preconditions.** Every verb runs `resolveTargetRepo`, refuses a non-`type:epic` target on
  `10`, reads the tree root through `assertGround` (`11` when it cannot be read), and runs
  the imported `requireClaim` on the **epic** number (`15`). **The run directory is eight verbs'
  precondition, not eleven's**: `ledger retopology`, `ledger digest` and `ledger defer` read no run
  directory at all — they belong to the descope route and answer from live board state — which is why
  each one runs on a lane with no staged plan.
  Every verb's `7` means **zero scope**. For every verb it covers the epic proven absent (404) or
  closed, and six widen it with documented arms — an empty run manifest for `ledger topology`, an
  epic declaring no topology for `ledger edges`, two for `ledger retopology` (an epic with no
  readable `## Dependencies` block, and one with no live child links), the named child proven absent
  or closed for `ledger supersede` and `ledger defer`, and the issue named by `--child` proven absent
  or closed for `ledger adopt` — stated in their own tables with their reasons.
  **`13` is not this group's.** `--require-clean` belongs to `fabrika build tree`, called once at
  the skill's step 1; no `ledger` verb declares that flag, so none can seat the code. It is carried
  in the matrix below only as a reserved seat with `build`'s meaning.
- **Every mutation is proven by a re-read**, never from the write response. v1 printed a link's
  `sub_issues_summary` out of the POST response and verified nothing.
- **Error-message prefix** is the invoked verb's name, contract-wide.
- **A non-zero exit is UNKNOWN** to the caller until the code is read.

### The shared exit matrix

This matrix owns `code → meaning`; the per-verb tables enumerate only that verb's own reachable
proven outcomes with triggers. `0`, `1`, `126`, `127` are the interface convention's reserved codes
(`src/verb.ts`, the exit-2 bootstrap in `src/bin.ts`), stated **only here**; every verb can return
them.

**Alignment.** `3`–`11` are `report`'s seats, re-exported from `src/build/codes.ts`, which is where
they are imported from `src/report/codes.ts` (under a `REPORT_`-prefixed alias there, and
re-exported unprefixed — `ledger/codes.ts` and `plan/codes.ts:36-47` are the shape to copy).
The group registers **`BUILD_SEATS`** in `ALIGNED_GROUPS` (`src/exit-code-alignment.ts`) — *not*
`SHARED_SEATS`, which omits `BAD_SECTIONS`; four verbs here seat `4`, so under `SHARED_SEATS` the
checker would report `4` as a private code colliding with the base. `build`, `ledger` and `plan`
claim all nine that way; `review`, `ship` and `triage` take `SHARED_SEATS` and leave `4` a
deliberate gap. **`15` is re-exported from `build` verbatim**, because this group asserts
the identical fact (this session holds this issue's claim)
and a caller driving both in one sweep must read one meaning for each.

**The re-export is selective and stops at `19`.** `13`, `14`, `16`, `17`, `18` and `19` come across
carrying `build`'s meanings and are **never reached here** — this skill declares no
`--require-clean` flag, holds no lane branch, pushes nothing, runs no validation, and derives no
readiness verdict — but carrying them keeps those seats occupied so a later verb here cannot
re-seat one. **`build`'s `21` is deliberately NOT re-exported**: this
group allocates its own `20`–`26`, and re-exporting `AUDIENCE_NOT_AGENT` alongside them would put two
names on one code in one module, which `allocatedCodes` (`exit-code-alignment.ts:96-105`) reports
as drift.

The rule this group follows, taken from `plan/codes.ts:30-31` rather than re-derived: **import a
code when two groups prove the same fact; allocate freely when they do not.** `20`–`26` below
overlap `build`'s and `plan`'s private bands and that is correct — none of those groups
can prove a fact about a *plan being authored*, an exit code is read off the command that produced
it, and the alignment checker is base-only by design (`occupied = allocatedCodes(base)`).

`13` is seated by **no** `ledger` verb. `--require-clean` is `fabrika build tree`'s flag, asserted
once at the skill's step 1, and the whole group inherits that ground rather than re-testing a tree
it never writes to. `14`, `16`, `17`, `18` and
`19` stay reserved with `build`'s meanings and are unreachable here, each for the same reason —
this skill cuts no branch, pushes nothing, and has no validation surface.

**`7` versus `11` versus `20`:** a 404 or a closed epic is a fact about the repository (`7`); an
unreachable GitHub or an unreadable probe is a fact about nothing (`11`); a base that is provably
behind the trunk is a fact about the checkout (`20`). A freshness probe that *fails* is `11`,
never `20` — "I could not tell" is not "it is stale", and it is certainly not "it is fresh".

**`8` versus `9` versus `23`:** `8` is a write whose outcome is unknown; `9` is a write that landed
and read back wrong; `23` is narrower and more useful than either — the create is **proven** and
the *link* is unknown, so a named child exists unlinked. Fusing `23` into `8` would leave a
successor unable to tell "something may exist" from "#5 exists and needs linking", which are
opposite repairs.

## `ledger open`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ledger open 3 --token <claim-token> [--repo <owner/name>]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<number>` | positional integer | yes | — | the epic being planned |
| `--token` | string | yes | — | the claim token `build claim <epic> --purpose plan` printed — which lane is asking, and the nonce the run key is derived from |
| `--repo` | string | no | `resolveRepo`'s precedence | the repository read |

**Output** — machine. One JSON object:

```
{"answer": "opened", "epic": 3, "run": "3-7f31a2", "mode": "fresh",
 "bodyDigest": "8f2c1a90b4d7", "dir": "/w/.fabrika-plan/3-7f31a2",
 "children": [], "cycleDoc": "present",
 "candidates": {"outcome": "candidates", "items": [{"number": 7, "title": "queue view for reports", "score": 3}]}}
```

`mode` is closed: `fresh` (the body carries no `## Plan (plan-epic)` heading) or `re-plan`
(exactly one). Two or more is `22` — the mode cannot be decided, and guessing is what corrupted
epics in v1. `children` lists the epic's existing sub-issues with their numbers, titles and
labels; on a `fresh` run it is normally empty and a non-empty one is a fact the skill must read,
not an error. `cycleDoc` is `present` / `absent` / `unknown` and decides whether
`**Containment:**` is required. `candidates` is the imported dedup ranker over the open backlog,
and its `outcome` is three-valued — `candidates`, `none`, `indeterminate` — so "nothing overlaps"
never reads the same as "the search index could not be reached".

The run directory is created here and nowhere else; every later verb resolves it from
`runKey(epic, nonce)` and refuses on `11` if it is gone.

**`ledger open` seeds `children.jsonl` with the epic's existing children**, one line each, carrying
`"linked":true` and `"mintedThisRun":false`; `ledger child` appends newly minted ones with
`"mintedThisRun":true`. The manifest is therefore **the epic's whole child set**, not this run's
additions — which is what makes `ledger topology` correct on a `re-plan`. Without the seed, a
re-plan's retained children are invisible to the topology check: naming one is a dangling ref
(`24`) and omitting it stages cleanly and is then `ORPHAN_CHILD` at the gate, with no third option
and no verb to record it. That is a planner writing a ledger its own gate rejects.

**A re-open of an existing run directory is a resume, not a reset.** `runKey` is derived from the
claim nonce, which a re-open does not change, so `ledger open` finds the previous attempt's files.
It **re-seeds `children.jsonl` from the live sub-issue list** (so a child minted before the
interruption is present exactly once, with its observed `linked` state) and **leaves `plan.md` and
`topology.md` untouched** — re-staging either is `ledger draft`'s and `ledger topology`'s job, and
silently discarding a staged document a caller has not replaced would lose authored work with no
refusal to notice.

**Freshness.** The verb resolves the trunk — `origin/<the repo's GitHub default branch>`, never a
spelled `main` — and compares the tree's merge base. Provably behind is `20`. A trunk read, fetch
or rev-parse that fails is `11`. There is no third arm: this verb never
answers "fresh" without having proven it, because the whole point is that v1 planned against
stale checkouts and minted phantom children, and no repo is guaranteed a post-merge sync at any
call site — so the tree is stale by default until shown otherwise.

**Exit status** (beyond the universal four)

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the epic is proven absent (404) or closed |
| `10` | the issue is not a `type:epic` |
| `11` | the epic, its sub-issue list, the backlog read, the cycle-doc probe, or the freshness probe could not be read |
| `15` | this lane does not hold the epic's claim |
| `20` | the tree's base is proven behind the trunk |
| `22` | the body carries two or more `## Plan (plan-epic)` headings — the run's mode cannot be decided |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `ledger open: issue #<n> is proven absent or closed.` | 7 | refusal |
| `ledger open: #<n> is not a type:epic — refusing to plan it.` | 10 | refusal |
| `ledger open: cannot read <what>: <reason> — the ground is UNKNOWN.` | 11 | refusal |
| `ledger open: this lane does not hold #<n>'s claim.` | 15 | refusal |
| `ledger open: base is <k> commit(s) behind origin/main — a plan derived here is derived on stale ground.` | 20 | refusal |
| `ledger open: #<n>'s body carries <k> "## Plan (plan-epic)" headings — the plan mode has no single meaning.` | 22 | refusal |

**Scope** — one epic, its sub-issue children, the open backlog for the dedup rank, one repo-file
probe, one git freshness probe. The stderr `scannedLine` names the child set and the backlog size
the rank was taken over. **Zero backlog results is a fact, not a failure** — this verb only
*supplies* the candidate list; a repository with no other open issues genuinely has no duplicates,
which is why `outcome: "none"` is an answer and only an unreachable index is `indeterminate`.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ledger open 3 --token <claim-token>
{"answer":"opened","epic":3,"run":"3-7f31a2","mode":"fresh","bodyDigest":"8f2c1a90b4d7","dir":"/w/.fabrika-plan/3-7f31a2","children":[],"cycleDoc":"present","candidates":{"outcome":"none","items":[]}}
```

```
$ fabrika ledger open 3 --token <claim-token>
ledger open: base is 47 commit(s) behind origin/main — a plan derived here is derived on stale ground.
$ echo $?
20
```

**Grounding**

- A stale checkout once inflated a baseline and spawned phantom children, and no post-merge sync
  runs on its own, so freshness is proven here rather than assumed.
- One tree per epic run; every subagent works in the tree the conductor is in.
- The run key is the claim nonce; sibling subagents share the session id, so a session-keyed
  namespace is not a namespace.
- v1 scar (`idempotency-sets.sh:27,33`) — `per_page=100` with no `--paginate` made the duplicate
  read blind past a hundred issues; this verb paginates in full and states its scope.
- v1 scar (`intake-dedup/command.ts:55`) — the no-keywords refusal printed to stderr and exited
  `0` with empty stdout, so "no duplicates" and "never ran" were the same bytes. The three-valued
  `outcome` is that hole closed.

## `ledger draft`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ledger draft 3 --body-digest 8f2c1a90b4d7 --token <claim-token> <<'EOF'
## Plan (plan-epic)

### Summary
...

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] every child's slice is wired end to end behind the flag
...
EOF
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<number>` | positional integer | yes | — | the epic whose plan is staged |
| `--body-digest` | string, 12 lowercase hex | yes | — | the digest `ledger open` printed; the draft refuses if the epic body has moved since |
| `--token` | string | yes | — | the claim token `build claim <epic> --purpose plan` printed — which lane is asking, and the nonce the run key is derived from |
| `--repo` | string | no | `resolveRepo`'s precedence | the repository read |
| stdin | markdown | yes | — | the plan block, opening with `## Plan (plan-epic)` |

**Output** — machine.
`{"answer": "staged", "epic": 3, "document": "plan", "sections": 11, "stories": [1,2,3], "bytes": 4187}`

The verb checks the closed section set (each of the eleven `###` headings present exactly once, in
order), that the block opens with `## Plan (plan-epic)`, that `### User stories` parses through
the imported `readEpicStories` to a contiguous id run from 1, and that `### Acceptance criteria`
reads back `Found` through the shared `wire/acceptance-criteria.ts`. It leak-scans the text, because the
block reaches a public issue body. It **does not judge content** — a `### Approach` reading "TBD"
stages cleanly, and catching that is the skill's job, not a verb's.

**A plan declaring zero stories is a `4`, refused here rather than discovered at the gate.** The
downstream floor treats an absent or empty story list as the defect `MISSING_STORIES_SECTION`, so
staging one would mean authoring a ledger this skill's own gate is guaranteed to reject — the
"planner writing a plan its gate rejects" failure this group exists to prevent. The trap it closes
is specific: `readEpicStories` collects ids only from ordered-list rows, so a `### User stories`
section full of `-` bullets or `S1`-style labels parses as **zero stories** while looking complete
to its author. That is the case the refusal is really for; a genuinely empty section is the easy
half.

Staged at `<dir>/plan.md`. Re-running replaces it; the last staged document is what `ledger write`
splices.

**Exit status** (beyond the universal four)

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing |
| `4` | a required `###` section is missing, duplicated or out of order; the block does not open with `## Plan (plan-epic)`; `### Acceptance criteria` is followed by a blank line or reads back absent/malformed; the plan declares zero user stories; or the story ids are not contiguous from 1 |
| `5` | the plan text carries a machine-local path |
| `6` | the plan text is a bare `@` path reference |
| `7` | the epic is proven absent or closed |
| `10` | the issue is not a `type:epic`, or `--body-digest` is not 12 lowercase hex |
| `11` | the epic body or the run directory could not be read |
| `15` | this lane does not hold the epic's claim |
| `21` | the recomputed body digest differs from `--body-digest` |

**Scope** — one document on stdin and one epic body read. Zero scope is unreachable: stdin is
required, and an empty one is `3`.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ledger draft 3 --body-digest 8f2c1a90b4d7 --token <claim-token> < plan.md
{"answer":"staged","epic":3,"document":"plan","sections":11,"stories":[1,2,3],"bytes":4187}

$ fabrika ledger draft 3 --body-digest 8f2c1a90b4d7 --token <claim-token> < plan.md
ledger draft: user stories are numbered 1, 2, 4 — a story list must run from 1 with no gaps or repeats.
$ echo $?
4
```

**Grounding**

- v1 scar (`epic-ledger/markdown.ts:47`) — story ids are ordered-list *positions*; an unordered
  or `S<n>` bullet parses as zero stories and the epic reads as declaring none. Refused here at
  authoring time rather than discovered at the gate.
- v1 scar — the plan's section set lived only in prose, so drift produced a `Corrupt` splice
  refusal much later with no statement of which section was wrong.
- `report/leaks.ts` — the plan is model-authored prose reaching a public surface, which is the
  seat `5` / `6` exist for.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `--type` | string, one of `type:bug`/`type:feature`/`type:chore`/`type:decision`/`type:investigation` | yes | — | the child's type label; `type:decision` with `--ready-for agent` is refused on `10` |

| `--milestone` | string (open milestone title) | **required unless a `--label` carries a standing lane** | none | the child's home; `.fabrika.jsonc`'s board vocabulary is read on every call, with or without this flag, and one that does not resolve is `11`; without the flag a call whose `--label`s name no declared standing lane is refused on `10` before anything is read from GitHub |

| `--repo` | string | no | `resolveRepo`'s precedence | the repository written |
| stdin | markdown | yes | — | the child body's fields and sections |

**Output** — machine, the **observed** result:

```
{"answer": "minted", "epic": 3, "child": 4, "linked": true,
 "observed": {"labels": ["p1","ready-for:agent","status:planned","type:feature"], "assignees": [], "milestone": "fabrika campaign"},
 "stories": [1,2], "containment": "flag"}
```

**Every birth attribute lands in the one `POST /issues` call** — `title`, `body`, every label
(`--type`, `--priority`, the board's planned status, `ready-for:<v>`, each `--label`), `milestone` and
`assignees`. This is the whole reason the verb exists: v1's create hardcoded exactly three
`labels[]` with no pass-through and set no milestone, so a fourth required label could only be
applied by a follow-up PATCH — and a follow-up PATCH opens a window in which the child exists with
**no** `ready-for:` value, which is the fail-open shape the ruling forbids, where an absent label
reads as a permissive default rather than an unknown. v1's own sibling script knows the hazard by
name and warns that patching a fresh child "reopens the label-less-orphan window".

**The planned status and the standing lanes come off one read of `.fabrika.jsonc`'s board
vocabulary.** The status is `boardVocabulary.statuses.planned` — `status:planned` where the repo
declares none — and a home is checked against `boardVocabulary.standingLanes`. A board vocabulary
that does not resolve is `11` before anything is read from GitHub, with or without `--milestone`.

**A home is required and is never defaulted**: the call names an open milestone, or a
`--label` from the standing lanes the repo declares (`boardVocabulary.standingLanes` in
`.fabrika.jsonc`) — a child carrying neither groups under no campaign and no lane, so nothing on the
board shows where it belongs, and the refusal sits at the mint, where nothing has been written yet.
The lane set is read from that one declaration, the same one `build pick` and the homing guard read,
and never listed in code: two copies is how two readers drift into disagreeing about what a home is.
A repo that declares no lane has one home to offer, the milestone, and a declaration that could not
be read is `11`.

**`--ready-for` is required and has no default**: a child must never inherit its audience
by omission. **`--ready-for human` requires `--assignee`**: the label is the routing
signal, born-assignment is the enforced hold, and neither substitutes for the other — a label
without assignment has no teeth, an assignment without the label hides the intent from queries.
This is not merely a convention: the gate's floor reds `HELD_CHILD_UNASSIGNED` over the **whole
epic**, so one held-and-unassigned child blocks every sibling.

**A `type:decision` child is never born `ready-for:agent`** — the pair is refused on `10` beside the
other pre-write input checks, before stdin, GitHub or the run file is read. A build claim admits a
decision only against a ruling comment recorded **on that decision issue**, and a child a second old
carries none, so the pair publishes a child every builder refuses on its type axis, which parks the
epic lane. The parent epic's ruling comment is not a substitute: the citation binds to the claimed
issue. The supported route is `--ready-for human` with `--assignee`, then a child-local ruling and
`fabrika decision rule <n> --cites <child-comment-url>`.

Order of operations, each guard against a named v1 failure. **The manifest append sits before the
link, deliberately** — see step 5.

1. **Read `run.json`** for `cycleDoc` and the epic's identity. Absent or unparseable is `11`.
2. **Compose and validate the body.** Fields through the imported `readChildStories` /
   `readContainment`, criteria through the imported acceptance-criteria reader — the same readers
   the gate uses, so a body that composes here cannot fail the gate on grammar. A `Malformed` or
   zero-criteria read is `4`. `**Containment:**` is emitted **only** when `run.json`'s `cycleDoc` is
   `present`; a child of a type the repo's `containmentVocabulary` asks, whose containment is off
   that vocabulary's values — including the reserved `none` — while `cycleDoc` is `present` is `4`.
   The gate's `MISSING_CONTAINMENT` derives from the same key, so admitting one here would author a
   defect the floor then reds.
3. **Vocabulary precondition.** Confirm every label and the milestone exist in the repository.
   `POST .../labels` **creates** an unknown label rather than rejecting it, and a closed
   milestone is off-vocabulary; refuse on `10` rather than minting taxonomy.
4. **Leak-scan** the composed body (`5` / `6`).
5. **Create,** with every attribute, in one `POST /repos/{repo}/issues` — `title`, `body`,
   `labels[]` (every one), `milestone` (the number resolved from the title in step 3), `assignees[]`.
   **The moment the create returns a number, append it to `<dir>/children.jsonl`** —
   `{"number","id","title","type","priority","readyFor","stories","containment","linked":false}` —
   **`id` is the database id the create response carries, and it is recorded because the sub-issue
   link and unlink both take it rather than the number**; without it on the manifest, `supersede`
   and any later link retry would have to re-read GitHub to find a value the run already held — and
   only then attempt the link. The ordering is load-bearing and it is what makes `23` survivable:
   a child recorded before its link is a child a successor can **find and name**, which is the whole
   of what the record buys — and it is enough, because the alternative is an issue that exists on
   GitHub and appears in no artifact this run produced. It is deliberately **not** placeable or
   retirable while unlinked: `topology` would render it as a ref that is not a linked child
   (`DANGLING_DEP` at the gate) and `supersede` refuses a non-sub-issue on `10`. The orphan needs a
   human to link it, and the manifest is how that human learns its number. Under the reverse order a `23` leaves an issue that exists on GitHub, is absent from
   the manifest, and can therefore be neither placed (`24`, dangling) nor retired (`10`, not a
   sub-issue) — created, unusable, and unreachable by every other verb in the group.
6. **Link** as a native sub-issue: `POST /repos/{repo}/issues/{epic}/sub_issues` with body
   `{"sub_issue_id": <the child's `id`, not its `number`>}`. The `id` is the database id the create
   response carries; the sub-issue API takes that and not the number, which is the one shape v1 got
   right and is worth not rediscovering. A create that landed and a link that cannot be proven is
   `23`. **No shipped module writes a sub-issue link** — `plan/github.ts:43`'s `listSubIssues` is
   the read half and is the sibling to model this on; the write is genuinely new.
7. **Re-read the child**, confirm the link by re-listing the epic's sub-issues, then rewrite that
   child's manifest line with `"linked":true` and report the observed labels, assignees and
   milestone — never the create response. v1 printed a link's summary straight out of the POST
   response and verified nothing.

**Scope** — one child created, one link written, one child re-read; the repository's label list and
open milestones read as preconditions. The stderr `scannedLine` names the label set checked. Zero
scope is unreachable: the verb writes exactly one child or refuses.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ledger child 3 --title "queue view: fate loader" --type type:feature --priority p1 --ready-for agent --milestone "fabrika campaign" --token <claim-token> < child.md
{"answer":"minted","epic":3,"child":4,"linked":true,"observed":{"labels":["p1","ready-for:agent","status:planned","type:feature"],"assignees":[],"milestone":"fabrika campaign"},"stories":[1,2],"containment":"flag"}

Mint it --ready-for human with --assignee, record the ruling on the child, then flip it with `fabrika decision rule <n> --cites <child-comment-url>`.
$ echo $?
10
```

**Grounding**

- Every child carries exactly one `ready-for:` value, set explicitly at creation and never
  inherited by omission.
- The label is the routing signal and born-assignment is the enforced hold; neither substitutes for
  the other. The gate's `HELD_CHILD_UNASSIGNED` is the enforcement, and it fails the whole epic.
- A decision claim's citation binds to the claimed issue, so a decision child born `ready-for:agent`
  is unbuildable from birth — the recorded incident needed a control-plane human to mirror the
  epic's ruling onto the child before its lane could move.
- v1 scar (`create-child.sh:48-55`) — three hardcoded `labels[]`, no pass-through, no milestone, so
  the create was not atomic over the child's birth attributes despite its own docblock's claim.
- v1 scar (`amend-child-labels.sh:2-4,18-19`) — the amend endpoint is additive, so "adjust" could
  only add, and it force-re-added `status:planned` to a child the gate may already have flipped.
- v1 scar (`link-child.sh:22-24`) — the link was reported from the POST response and verified
  nowhere; `confirm-links.sh` was a separate manual step whose only assertion was a comment.
- `POST .../labels` creates unknown labels; the vocabulary check is a precondition.
- The priority set is `{p0,p1,p2}`; `p3` is retired, not admitted.

## `ledger adopt`

Brings an **already-filed** issue into the plan as a child, so work that is already on the board is
planned where its history lives instead of minted again beside it. Before this verb, the only moves
were a near-duplicate from `ledger child` or a hand-link outside every verb that the gate then
failed on the issue's missing `**Stories:**` line.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ledger adopt 3 --child 5 [--stories 2] [--containment "flag (default-off)"] --token <claim-token>
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<number>` | positional integer | yes | — | the parent epic |
| `--child` | integer | yes | — | the already-filed issue joining the plan |
| `--stories` | string, bare integers or `none` | **required when the issue declares no `**Stories:**` line** | none | the plan's story ids for this child; parsed through the gate's `readChildStories` grammar before anything is read, `10` when it does not conform |
| `--containment` | string, a `containmentVocabulary` keyword with an optional trailing parenthetical | **required for an asked type with no `**Containment:**` line while `cycleDoc` is `present`** | none | ignored, with a stderr note, when `cycleDoc` is not `present` — the same rule `ledger child` applies |
| `--token` | string | yes | — | the claim token `build claim <epic> --purpose plan` printed |
| `--repo` | string | no | `resolveRepo`'s precedence | the repository written |

**Output** — machine, the observed result:

```
{"answer":"adopted","epic":3,"child":5,"linked":true,"link":"written","amended":true,
 "park":"written","fields":["**Stories:** 2"],"stories":[2],"containment":null}
```

`link` is `written` when this call linked the issue and `already` when the parent endpoint already
named this epic. `park` is `written` when this call moved the issue off `status:triaged` and
`already` when it no longer carried it. `amended` says whether an amendment was appended, and
`fields` lists exactly the lines it carried.

### Authority: what adoption may write, and what it may not

The authority below rests on one rule: an issue body is amended by **appending a dated amendment,
never by overwriting**. GitHub keeps no issue-body history, so an overwritten body is a lost one.
It is the same amend-never-rewrite convention the acceptance-criteria reader is built around, and
`report amend`'s envelope is reused for it
([`report/amend.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/amend.ts)). The ruling that selected
this authority is cited from the verb's source, in
[`ledger/adoption.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/ledger/adoption.ts).

- **What adoption may write.** On the adopted issue, one dated amendment
  (`---`, `## Amendment — <UTC date>`, one line naming the epic, then the field lines) carrying only
  the `**Stories:**` and `**Containment:**` lines the body does not already declare, and one status
  move: add `status:planned`, then remove `status:triaged`. On the plan, the manifest line and the
  native sub-issue link, as `ledger child` does. That is the whole write surface.
- **Why the status moves.** A plan's child is unpickable until the gate has checked the plan and the
  founder has approved it. A minted child gets that by being born `status:planned`. An adopted
  child was triaged before this plan existed, so it may be pickable. Adoption parks it on
  `status:planned` before it links it, and `plan flip` restores `status:triaged` on a clean floor,
  exactly as it does for a minted child. So an issue on any other status is refused: the flip could
  only restore `status:triaged`, and the status it had would be lost.
- **What the planner must supply.** `--stories` whenever the body has no `**Stories:**` line, and
  `--containment` whenever the gate would ask for a containment value the body lacks. The values are
  flags, not free text, so the amendment holds nothing a validator did not read.
- **What it never writes.** Nothing above the amendment changes: title, the report, its
  investigation notes, and its acceptance criteria all survive byte for byte, proven on a re-read
  of both halves. Adoption writes no milestone or assignee, and no label except the status move
  above, so the issue keeps its type, priority, audience and home.
- **What needs a separate ruling or another owner.** Changing a field the body already declares,
  repairing a non-conforming or duplicated field line, and authoring missing acceptance criteria
  are all rewrites or a re-scope. Adoption refuses each (`4`) and names the gap. The repair is a
  body edit by a human or by `triage`, or a separate ruling that widens this authority. Moving an
  issue out of another epic (`10`) is that epic's plan's call, not this one's.

### Order of operations

Every judgment runs before the first write, so a refusal before step 6 writes nothing.

1. **Validate the flags.** `--child` names the epic itself, or `--stories` does not conform: `10`,
   before any read.
2. **Prove the ground** exactly as every `ledger` verb does, then read `run.json` and
   `children.jsonl`. Both must exist, so `ledger open` runs first.
3. **Read the issue and its parent.** Absent or closed is `7`. A pull request, or an issue whose
   parent endpoint names another epic, is `10`. A failed read is `11`.
4. **Judge it through the gate's own readers**
   ([`ledger/adoption.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/ledger/adoption.ts)). A
   `type:epic`, `status:needs-triage`, a missing `type:`/`status:`/priority label, or
   `ready-for:human` with nobody assigned is `10`. Those are the gate's own `MISSING_LABEL`,
   `NEEDS_TRIAGE_LABEL` and `HELD_CHILD_UNASSIGNED` predicates, imported. A status other than
   `status:triaged` or `status:planned` is `10` too. Criteria that read absent
   or malformed, a field line declared twice or non-conforming, a declared value that differs from
   the flag, a declared containment off the vocabulary, or a required field with no flag is `4`. An
   issue this step admits cannot fail the floor on these fields.
5. **Check the taxonomy, only if a park is owed.** When the issue carries `status:triaged` and not
   yet `status:planned`, read the repository's labels. `POST .../labels` creates an unknown label
   rather than rejecting it, so an absent `status:planned` is `10`, and a failed read is `11`.
6. **Amend, only if a field is owed.** Leak-scan the section (`5`), PATCH the composed body, then
   re-read it and prove that the amendment is present **and** that the prior body survived. `8` on
   an unprovable PATCH, `9` on a body missing either half.
7. **Park, only if the issue still carries `status:triaged`.** Add `status:planned` if it is
   absent, then remove `status:triaged`. Add before remove, as `plan flip` does, so an issue caught
   between the two still carries a `status:` label. Re-read the issue and prove it carries
   `status:planned` and not `status:triaged`. `8` when it does not.
8. **Record** the child in `children.jsonl`, with `linked` set to what the parent endpoint showed.
   An existing line for this number is **replaced**, never appended beside. `26` on failure.
9. **Link** on the issue's database `id`, unless the parent endpoint already named this epic.
   Then re-list the epic's sub-issues to prove it and rewrite the manifest line `linked: true`.
   `23` on an unproven link.

The park comes before the link, so the issue is never a linked child while it is still pickable.

**Every leg is idempotent against live state, so a re-run is the recovery.** The amendment is
composed only from lines the body does not already declare. The park is skipped when the issue no
longer carries `status:triaged`. The manifest line is replaced rather than appended. The link is
skipped when the parent already names this epic. So after `8`, `23` or
`26`, run the same command again: it re-reads the issue and repeats only what is missing, and a
landed amendment is never doubled. `9` is the exception, because the body is in a state nobody
composed, and it needs a human eye.

| `4` | the issue's acceptance criteria read absent or malformed; a `**Stories:**` or `**Containment:**` line declared twice, or non-conforming; a declared value that differs from the flag; a declared containment off the vocabulary for an asked type; or a required field is undeclared and its flag was not passed |

| `9` | amended, and the body does not read back as the prior body plus the amendment |
| `10` | not a `type:epic`; `status:planned` absent from the repository's labels; `--child` is the epic, a pull request, a `type:epic`, `status:needs-triage`, on a status other than `status:triaged` or `status:planned`, missing a `type:`/`status:`/priority label, held with nobody assigned, or a sub-issue of another epic; `--stories` or `--containment` off its vocabulary |
| `11` | a precondition read failed — **nothing was written** |
| `15` | this lane does not hold the epic's claim |
| `23` | the issue is recorded `linked:false` and its sub-issue link could not be proven; re-run |

when a park is owed; at most one PATCH, one label added, one label removed and one link written. The stderr `scannedLine` names how many field lines were owed. Zero scope is `7`:
the epic, or the one issue named by `--child`, proven absent or closed. There is no partial scope,
because the verb adopts exactly that one issue or refuses.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ledger adopt 3 --child 5 --stories 2 --token <claim-token>
{"answer":"adopted","epic":3,"child":5,"linked":true,"link":"written","amended":true,"park":"written","fields":["**Stories:** 2"],"stories":[2],"containment":null}
```

```
$ fabrika ledger adopt 3 --child 5 --stories 2 --token <claim-token>
{"answer":"adopted","epic":3,"child":5,"linked":true,"link":"already","amended":false,"park":"already","fields":[],"stories":[2],"containment":null}
```

```
$ fabrika ledger adopt 3 --child 5 --token <claim-token>
ledger adopt: #5 cannot be adopted: it declares no **Stories:** line — pass --stories with the plan's story ids, or none.
$ echo $?
4
```

**Grounding**

- A planner told to link an already-filed report minted a near-duplicate to discharge it instead,
  because no verb could adopt it and a hand-link would have failed the gate on `MISSING_STORY`. A
  later epic assembled wholly from existing issues stopped before minting seven near-duplicates for
  the same reason.
- The gate refuses a field line declared twice (`plan/load.ts`), so appending a second
  `**Stories:**` beside a declared one would author a defect. That is why adoption appends only
  undeclared lines and refuses a differing value.
- The single-issue payload carries no `parent` key, so the parent is read through
  `build/github.ts`'s `getParent`, whose 404 is the proven-standalone answer.

## `ledger topology`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ledger topology 3 --token <claim-token> <<'EOF'
#4 phase 1
#5 phase 1
#6 phase 2 requires #4, #9
EOF
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<number>` | positional integer | yes | — | the epic whose topology is declared |
| `--token` | string | yes | — | the claim token `build claim <epic> --purpose plan` printed — which lane is asking, and the nonce the run key is derived from |
| `--repo` | string | no | `resolveRepo`'s precedence | the repository read |
| stdin | line grammar | yes | — | one line per child: `#<ref> phase <n> [requires #<a>[, #<b>]…]` |

**Output** — machine.

```
{"answer": "staged", "epic": 3, "document": "topology", "phases": 2, "children": 3,
 "edges": {"rows": [["#6","#4"],["#6","#9"]], "more": 0}, "external": 1, "bytes": 218}
```

Lines are order-indifferent. **Every phase member and every `requires:` subject is a child of the
run manifest, placed exactly once — and the manifest is the epic's whole child set, retained
children included**, which is what makes a `re-plan` placeable; a manifest child with no line is an
unplaced child and a line whose subject is not in the manifest places a stranger in one of this
epic's phases — both `24`. Edges are ordered `[dependent, prerequisite]`: `["#6","#4"]` reads *#6
requires #4*. `edges` is a bounded evidence array — a validated echo of the caller's own stdin, one
pair per declared `requires` — so it collapses to a cap-and-count: the first 5 pairs in `rows`, with
`more` counting what followed (`0` when the array was whole); the rendered block still carries every
edge.

**A prerequisite need not be a child of this epic.** The decision corpus rules a `requires:`
reference to an issue another epic owns a legitimate gating edge, and only a reference proven absent
dangling — so `#6 phase 2 requires #4, #9` stages with `#9` outside the manifest, the rendered block
carries that reference verbatim, and `ledger edges` writes the `#6 → #9` pair like any other.
`external` counts those out-of-manifest prerequisites.

**The one prerequisite refused outright is the epic's own number.** `#6 phase 2 requires #3` under
`ledger topology 3` is `24` before any boundary read: the epic exists, so proving the target would
answer Present and the line would stage, and `ledger edges` would then write `#6` `blocked_by` its
own parent — an edge that can never clear, because an epic closes only once its children close, and
`build`'s gates read that graph and nothing else. The refusal is pure and reaches the **immediate**
parent alone; a grandparent epic that transitively contains the child is neither this epic's number
nor a manifest child, so nothing separates it from the sanctioned cross-epic edge without walking
the child's parent chain, which is a boundary read this verb does not take.

**Every open blocker of the epic itself is a prerequisite ref on every child.** Read `#<epic>`'s own
native `blocked_by` list before you write these lines, and put each target that is still open on
every child's line in the same `requires` shape an out-of-epic prerequisite already takes —
`#<child> phase <n> requires #<blocker>`, one `#<int>` per open target, on the child that needs no
other prerequisite exactly as on the child that has three. Nothing else carries that edge down: an
epic takes its `gate` claim while its own blockers are open, `plan flip` then makes every child
pickable, and a child's build claim reads that child's edges alone — so a blocker recorded only at
epic level fences the epic and nobody else, and each child is buildable against a contract that has
not landed. The decision corpus's carry-down ruling on the blocked-by graph rules it; the gate's
`DROPPED_EPIC_BLOCKER` reds a plan that dropped one, naming the child and the target. A blocker
that is itself a child of this epic is not carried down — that edge is the plan's own sequencing,
already stated by the phase spine or a `requires:` row.

**Each external target is proven at the boundary before anything is staged**, through the same
`repos/{o}/{r}/issues/<n>` read `ledger edges` resolves an id with. Proven absent is `24`; an
unread target is `11`; and a number that resolves to a **pull request** is `24`, because that
endpoint serves pull requests too — its 404 arm never fires for one, and the corpus names a blocking
pull request by the issue its merge closes. None of the three writes `topology.md`.

The verb renders the `## Dependencies` block into `<dir>/topology.md` and then **parses its own
output back through the imported `readTopology`**, refusing on `24` if the round trip does not
reproduce the declared edge set. That check is the reason this verb composes rather than the skill:
a block that the gate's parser reads differently from how its author meant it is exactly the class
of defect nobody notices until a build runs in the wrong order.

**A cycle is `24`**, walked transitively and reported as the member set. **This verb cannot see a
shared-file conflict** — whether two children in one phase write the same module is a judgment the
skill carries, and the verb does not pretend otherwise.

**Scope** — the run manifest's whole child set and every declared line, plus one read of the epic for the shared preconditions and one read per out-of-manifest prerequisite. It writes nothing to GitHub. **Zero scope reds on `7`**:
an empty manifest means the epic has no children at all — none retained by the seed and none minted since — and rendering a topology over no children
would produce a `## Dependencies` block the gate reads as an epic every one of whose children is
orphaned. It is `7` rather than `24` because nothing was validated — a refused scope is not an
invalid topology, the same split `plan check` makes when it seats a childless epic on `7` instead
of calling it defect number one — every guard fails closed on zero scope rather than reporting a
clean run over nothing.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ledger topology 3 --token <claim-token> < topo.txt
{"answer":"staged","epic":3,"document":"topology","phases":2,"children":3,"edges":{"rows":[["#6","#4"],["#6","#9"]],"more":0},"external":1,"bytes":218}
```

```
$ fabrika ledger topology 3 --token <claim-token> < topo.txt
ledger topology: child #5 is placed in no phase.
$ echo $?
24
```

```
$ fabrika ledger topology 3 --token <claim-token> < topo.txt
ledger topology: #9 is named as an external prerequisite and is proven absent — no edge can point at it.
$ echo $?
24
```

```
$ fabrika ledger topology 3 --token <claim-token> < topo.txt
ledger topology: #6 requires #3, the epic that owns it — an epic closes only once its children close, so that edge can never clear and #6 would never be claimable.
$ echo $?
24
```

**Grounding**

- An empty manifest is a refused scope, never a rendered empty topology: a guard over zero scope
  fails closed.
- A cross-epic `requires:` is a legitimate gating edge, not a dangling one — the corpus ruled that,
  and a manifest-only known set here contradicted the ruling at the one seam where a planner can
  publish such an edge, which left the graph writable only by hand. Proving the target at this
  boundary is what keeps "only a reference proven absent dangles" true rather than fail-open.
- Two slices sharing a central file are not parallel; the verb cannot decide that and says
  so rather than implying its verdict is complete.
- v1 had no round-trip check on the composed block at all; the first time anyone learned the
  topology parsed differently than intended was when the gate derived the wrong defects.
- `build/dependencies.ts` — the block is composed against the shipped reader, so this spec adds no
  second `## Dependencies` grammar.

## `ledger write`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ledger write 3 --body-digest 8f2c1a90b4d7 --token <claim-token>
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<number>` | positional integer | yes | — | the epic whose body is written |
| `--body-digest` | string, 12 lowercase hex | yes | — | the digest `ledger open` printed; the write refuses if the body has moved since |
| `--token` | string | yes | — | the claim token `build claim <epic> --purpose plan` printed — which lane is asking, and the nonce the run key is derived from |
| `--repo` | string | no | `resolveRepo`'s precedence | the repository written |

**Output** — machine.

```
{"answer": "written", "epic": 3, "mode": "fresh", "bodyDigest": "8f2c1a90b4d7",
 "newDigest": "c41b7e0a91f6", "planBytes": 4187, "topologyBytes": 214, "verified": true}
```

Order of operations:

1. **Read `run.json`** for `mode` and the epic's identity, and **require both staged documents** —
   `<dir>/plan.md` and `<dir>/topology.md`. A missing document is `25` naming it: proven, because
   its absence is a fact about this run, not a read that failed. An absent or unparseable
   `run.json` is `11`. **`mode` is never re-derived here.** It was decided once by `ledger open`,
   and a `write` that recomputed it from the live body could disagree with the `open` that named
   the run — which is precisely how the mode-mismatch arm below becomes unreachable and a
   first-time append silently overwrites a real plan.
2. **Re-read the live body and recompute the digest.** A difference is `21`; nothing is written.
   The gap between deciding and writing is closed by re-deciding, not by trusting.
3. **Resolve the plan region through the enrichment marker.** On `mode: fresh`, the body must carry
   zero `## Plan (plan-epic)` headings and the plan and topology are **appended**, the live bytes
   above them untouched. On `mode: re-plan`, exactly one of each heading must resolve, and the
   region between the `## Plan (plan-epic)` heading and the end of the `## Dependencies` block is
   replaced. Anything else is `22` and **nothing is written**: two plan headings on a `fresh` run,
   a `re-plan` whose body carries none (the anchor drifted or was deleted), or a `## Dependencies`
   heading that resolves inside the preserved brief envelope. Because `mode` is carried rather than
   inferred, "zero headings" and "`re-plan`" are independently observable and their disagreement is
   a refusal instead of a silent append.
4. **PATCH once**, then **re-read and compare**. The comparison is over the normalized body and it
   checks the *whole* result, not a re-extraction of the region — v1 truncated an epic body to
   end-of-file whenever a `## Dependencies` heading appeared inside the preserved brief, and its
   round-trip check could not see it because both sides ran the same first-occurrence extractor.
   A PATCH whose status is unreadable is `8`; a body that lands and does not match is `9`.

**The region is never cut to end-of-file.** v1's replace branch sliced from the `## Dependencies`
heading to EOF on the assumption that dependencies are the last section, destroying anything a
human had appended below with no guard at all. This verb resolves a bounded region and preserves
every byte outside it.

**Exit status** (beyond the universal four)

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the epic is proven absent or closed |
| `8` | the PATCH was issued and its outcome could not be proven — UNKNOWN |
| `9` | the body was written and does not read back as composed |
| `10` | the issue is not a `type:epic`, or `--body-digest` is not 12 lowercase hex |
| `11` | the epic body or the run directory could not be read — **nothing was written** |
| `15` | this lane does not hold the epic's claim |
| `21` | the recomputed body digest differs from `--body-digest` |
| `22` | the plan region is unresolvable: a duplicated anchor, or a mode the body contradicts |
| `25` | `plan.md` or `topology.md` was never staged in this run |

| `ledger write: cannot read <what>: <reason> — nothing was written.` | 11 | refusal |
| `ledger write: this lane does not hold #<n>'s claim.` | 15 | refusal |

**Scope** — one epic body read, one PATCH, one confirming read. Zero scope is unreachable: the
staged documents are required and their absence is `25`.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ledger write 3 --body-digest 8f2c1a90b4d7 --token <claim-token>
{"answer":"written","epic":3,"mode":"fresh","bodyDigest":"8f2c1a90b4d7","newDigest":"c41b7e0a91f6","planBytes":4187,"topologyBytes":214,"verified":true}
```

```
$ fabrika ledger write 3 --body-digest 8f2c1a90b4d7 --token <claim-token>
ledger write: topology.md was never staged in this run — stage it before writing.
$ echo $?
25
```

**Grounding**

- Detection is the whole-line enrichment marker, so position is not load-bearing
  and the plan may sit below the brief envelope.
- v1 truncated a body to EOF when a `## Dependencies` heading sat inside the preserved
  brief, and the round-trip check reused the buggy extractor so it could not see it. The bounded
  region and the whole-body comparison answer both halves.
- v1 scar (`splice-body.sh:174-175,185`) — the PATCH's exit status was never checked and the
  confirming read's failure was not either, so a rejected write, a failed read and a genuine race
  all printed "a racer clobbered it" and the terminal then fabricated a half-written diagnosis.
  `8`, `9`, `21` and `22` are those four states separated.
- v1 scar (`splice-body.sh:101`) — a `for attempt in 1 2 3` loop whose every branch broke, so the
  second attempt was unreachable while the terminal message claimed "every attempt raced". This
  verb attempts once and says so.
- The caller's command substitution stripped trailing newlines before the PATCH, so a raw
  byte comparison could never succeed; the digest and the comparison both normalize.

## `ledger edges`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ledger edges <epic> --token <claim-token> [--repo owner/name]
```

**Answer**

```json
{"answer": "reconciled", "epic": 3, "required": 3, "already": 1, "written": 2, "verified": true}
```

**Why it exists.** The `## Dependencies` block is a **picture** of the dependency graph, never the
graph. GitHub's native `blocked_by` edges are the one carrier of blockedness, and `build eligible` /
`build claim` read only those. So a plan that stops at the picture admits a child it has itself
declared blocked: an epic once stated in three places that a child waited on an open, unruled
decision, and `build claim` took that child on `scanned 0 blocked_by edges`. This verb is the
bridge.

Order of operations:

1. **Read the epic's own body**, not this run's staged `topology.md`. The board is what the gates
   read, so the board is what the graph is compared against — and reading the body is what lets this
   verb reconcile an epic some earlier run planned, which is the whole repair path for an epic
   already published with prose-only dependencies. An unparseable block is `4`; a body with no block,
   or one whose block parses to nothing, is `7`.
2. **Derive the required pairs** through `requiredEdges` in
   [`build/dependencies.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/build/dependencies.ts) — one
   statement of the rule, shared with the gate's `UNENFORCED_DEP`. A `requires:` row is the precise
   gate where one is present; otherwise the phase boundary is, and the subject waits on every earlier
   phase. A ledger-local `C<int>` names no issue, so no edge over it is required.
3. **Read one `blocked_by` list per dependent**, bounded at concurrency 8. An unread list is `11`
   and **nothing is written** — an edge nobody could see is never an edge that is there.
4. **Resolve each missing prerequisite's internal `id`** and POST the edge on that id, never on the
   issue number ([`io/edges.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/io/edges.ts)'s
   `EDGE-BODY-TAKES-AN-INTERNAL-ID`). A prerequisite proven absent is `24`: the topology is wrong,
   and no edge can point at it.
5. **Re-read every dependent's list and prove each required pair** — but only when a POST was
   issued. A POST's own response is not evidence: a refused write and a write whose response was
   lost look identical at the client, and only the graph tells them apart. With nothing missing
   there is nothing to prove, step 3's read having already proved every pair present, so the verb
   answers off that read; re-reading anyway would let a transient blip seat `8` over zero writes.
   An unread re-read is `8`; a pair that does not read back is `9`.

**Reconcile, never replace.** Only missing edges are written. An edge the block does not name is
left alone, because a `blocked_by` list may carry edges no ledger authored — a human's, another
epic's — and deleting one would unblock work on the strength of a document that was never the
carrier. The verb is therefore idempotent: a second run over a reconciled epic writes nothing,
issues no confirming read, and answers `written: 0`.

**Exit status** (beyond the universal four)

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `4` | the `## Dependencies` block is unparseable |
| `7` | the epic is proven absent or closed, or it declares no topology — zero scope |
| `8` | edges were POSTed and the graph could not be re-read — UNKNOWN; unreachable when zero were POSTed |
| `9` | the graph does not read back carrying every required edge |
| `10` | the issue is not a `type:epic` |
| `11` | a read failed before any write — **nothing was written** |
| `15` | this lane does not hold the epic's claim |
| `24` | a prerequisite the block names is proven absent, so no edge can point at it |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `ledger edges: #<n>'s ## Dependencies block is unparseable at line <k>: <text>` | 4 | refusal |
| `ledger edges: #<n> declares no topology — refusing to answer over zero scope.` | 7 | refusal |
| `ledger edges: <k> edge(s) were POSTed and cannot be confirmed — cannot read <what>: <reason>.` (`<k>` is never 0) | 8 | refusal |
| `ledger edges: <k> edge(s) do not read back on the graph — it needs a human eye.` | 9 | refusal |
| `ledger edges: #<n> is not a type:epic — refusing to write edges for it.` | 10 | refusal |

| `ledger edges: this lane does not hold #<n>'s claim.` | 15 | refusal |
| `ledger edges: #<n> is named as a prerequisite and is proven absent — no edge can point at it.` | 24 | refusal |

**Scope** — one epic body read, one `blocked_by` read per dependent, one POST per missing edge, and,
only when at least one edge was POSTed, one confirming read per dependent. The scanned line names
the required-edge count, so an answer over a surprising scope is auditable without re-running.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ledger edges 3 --token <claim-token>
ledger edges: scanned 3 required edges.
{"answer":"reconciled","epic":3,"required":3,"already":1,"written":2,"verified":true}
```

The idempotent re-run — nothing missing, so nothing is POSTed and no confirming read is issued:

```
$ fabrika ledger edges 3 --token <claim-token>
ledger edges: scanned 3 required edges.
{"answer":"reconciled","epic":3,"required":3,"already":3,"written":0,"verified":true}
```

```
$ fabrika ledger edges 3 --token <claim-token>
ledger edges: #3 declares no topology — refusing to answer over zero scope.
$ echo $?
7
```

**Grounding**

- The defect this verb answers: a prose-only dependency block let a build gate admit a child the
  epic had itself declared blocked.
- The `blocked_by` graph is the carrier; the prose block is at most a picture of it.
- [`map ticket`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/map/ticket-verb.ts) — the shipped precedent for
  writing an edge on a resolved internal id, whose shape this verb follows rather than re-deriving.

## `ledger supersede`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ledger supersede 3 --child 8 --reason "folded into the loader slice" --token <claim-token>
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<number>` | positional integer | yes | — | the parent epic |
| `--child` | integer | yes | — | the child being retired |
| `--reason` | string | yes | — | why it is retired; posted as the journal comment |
| `--token` | string | yes | — | the claim token `build claim <epic> --purpose plan` printed — which lane is asking, and the nonce the run key is derived from |
| `--repo` | string | no | `resolveRepo`'s precedence | the repository written |

**Output** — machine.
`{"answer": "superseded", "epic": 3, "child": 8, "comment": 5230661234, "unlinked": true, "state": "closed"}`

Three legs in a fixed order — **comment, unlink, close** — then a re-read proving `state` is
`closed` with `state_reason` `not_planned`. The order is load-bearing: closing before unlinking
leaves a closed issue still counted as a sub-issue, which the gate reads as a child in scope that
can never carry a live assignee. Whether that residue keeps a pre-existing child in floor scope is
undecided; this verb simply does not create more of it.

The three calls, so an implementer needs no other document:

1. `POST /repos/{repo}/issues/{child}/comments` with body
   `{"body": "Superseded by re-plan of #<epic>: <reason>."}` — the journal, posted first so the
   reason survives even if a later leg fails.
2. `DELETE /repos/{repo}/issues/{epic}/sub_issue` with body `{"sub_issue_id": <the child's `id`>}` —
   the same `id`-not-`number` shape `ledger child` uses to link. Nothing shipped performs this
   write; it is new alongside the link.
3. `PATCH /repos/{repo}/issues/{child}` with `{"state": "closed", "state_reason": "not_planned"}`.

The verb refuses a `--child` that is not a sub-issue of `<number>` (`10`), and refuses one whose
manifest line carries `"mintedThisRun":true` (`10`) — a child the current plan just minted is not
one the current plan supersedes, and letting that through is how a re-plan deletes its own work.
A **retained** child (`"mintedThisRun":false`, seeded by `ledger open`) is exactly what this verb
exists for, so the refusal narrows to the minted set rather than the whole manifest.

**Grounding**

- v1 scar (`supersede-child.sh:28`) — the final PATCH's result was unchecked and unverified, and
  the whole issue JSON was dumped on stdout with no `--jq`, so the success channel and the failure
  channel were two shapes on one stream.
- v1 scar (`teardown-scratch-epic.sh:8-9`) — a destructive verb that "closes exactly the numbers
  you name" with no guard at all. The sub-issue check and the manifest check are that guard.
- Whether pre-existing closed or unassigned held children stay in floor scope is undecided;
  this verb does not decide it and does not add to the residue.

## `ledger defer`

**Output** — machine.
`{"answer": "deferred", "epic": 3, "child": 8, "comment": 5230661234, "unlinked": true, "state": "open"}`

Two legs in a fixed order — **comment, unlink** — then a re-read proving the child is still `open`
and no longer a sub-issue. The comment goes first so the reason survives a failed unlink. The
read-back proves the pair rather than reporting the calls as made; a child that comes back closed is
a write nobody here issued, and it needs a person rather than a retry.

**It never calls the close endpoint.** That is the whole difference from `ledger supersede`: a
superseded child is work the plan abandoned and closes `not_planned`, while a deferred child is work
the founder still wants, moved out of *this* epic's scope, so closing it would delete the follow-up.
This verb is the board half of an authorized deferral;
`fabrika lane amend <lane> --defer <task> --defer-reason "<why>"` is the ledger half, and neither
does the other's work. It reads no staged plan run, because a descoped epic is found with its run
cleared (§Shared conventions).

`dropped` carries the count beside every ref it names — the list is whole, never sampled — and the
stderr note prints the same refs, so the two channels never state different numbers. An operator
told to put the staleness on the record can read the whole of it off either one.

**What it is for.** A founder descope unlinks a child on the board and leaves the epic body's
topology naming it, so `lane emit` refuses at `16` forever and the epic's tail can never boot. No
verb an operator owns repaired that: every other verb in this group requires a staged plan run, so
fixing one line meant re-running a whole authoring pass, and `ledger supersede` is the wrong shape
— it closes the child `not_planned`, while a descoped child keeps living on its own lane.

Order of operations:

1. **Open the ground** — the same `openGround` every sibling runs: the repo, the `type:epic` check
   (`10`), the tree root, and this lane's claim (`15`). It reads **no run directory**: no
   `run.json`, no manifest, no staged document, because a cleared or absent run is exactly the
   state a descoped epic is found in.
2. **Recompute the body digest** and refuse `21` on a difference, before anything is composed.
3. **Read the live sub-issue list.** A failed read is `11`; an empty one is `7` — a block naming
   exactly the live children would name nobody.
4. **Read the block against that list, dropping what it does not name.** The reader is the shared
   `readDeclared` (`src/ledger/topology-doc.ts`) `lane emit --children` reads through, so the two
   surfaces can never disagree about which refs survive: a dropped ref leaves its phase and every
   `requires` list naming it, a `requires` line whose subject went is dropped whole, and a phase
   left with no members is elided. A line dropped whole still has its `needs` read, so a ref that
   appears **only** there is reported like any other — the count never states fewer drops than the
   rewrite made. No heading, or a heading no `phase` line places anybody under, is `7`; a line that
   does not parse is `4`.
5. **Validate and render** through `checkTopology` — duplicates, a live child the block places in
   no phase, a cycle, and the round trip back through the shipped reader are all `24`, with
   nothing written.
6. **Splice the block alone** through `spliceDependencies` (`src/ledger/region.ts`), which resolves
   the region by anchor and ends it at the next top-level heading **or the first thematic break**,
   whichever comes first — the boundary `build/dependencies.ts` reads the section to. Everything
   outside it is preserved: the `## Plan (plan-epic)` block, the preserved brief envelope, and a
   dated amendment filed under a `---`. A duplicated heading, or one resolving inside the brief
   envelope, is `22`.
7. **PATCH once, then re-read and compare** the whole normalized body — `8` on an unconfirmable
   PATCH, `9` on a body that does not read back as composed. A composition byte-identical to the
   live body **issues no PATCH at all** and answers `"unchanged"`, so a second run over a repaired
   epic writes nothing.

**It closes, unlinks and comments on nothing.** A descoped child is left open and unlinked exactly
as the founder left it; retiring a child stays `ledger supersede`'s job, and this verb must not
grow a second path to it.

**Exit status** (beyond the universal four)

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `4` | a line under the `## Dependencies` heading does not parse |
| `7` | the epic is proven absent or closed, it carries no readable `## Dependencies` block, or it has no sub-issue links |
| `8` | the PATCH was issued and its outcome could not be proven — UNKNOWN |
| `9` | the body was written and does not read back as composed |
| `10` | the issue is not a `type:epic`, or `--body-digest` is not 12 lowercase hex |
| `11` | the epic, its children or its claim could not be read — **nothing was written** |
| `15` | this lane does not hold the epic's claim |
| `21` | the recomputed body digest differs from `--body-digest` |
| `22` | the `## Dependencies` region has no single meaning — a duplicated heading, or one inside the preserved brief envelope |
| `24` | the rewritten topology is invalid: a duplicate placement, an unplaced `requires` subject, a live child placed in no phase, a cycle, or a block that does not parse back to what was rendered |

**Errors**

**Scope** — one epic body read, one sub-issue list read, at most one PATCH, one confirming read.
Zero scope is `7`: an epic with no live children, and an epic with no block to rewrite.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ledger digest 3 --token <claim-token>
{"answer":"digest","epic":3,"bodyDigest":"8f2c1a90b4d7"}
$ fabrika ledger retopology 3 --body-digest 8f2c1a90b4d7 --token <claim-token>
{"answer":"rewritten","epic":3,"children":2,"phases":2,"dropped":{"count":1,"rows":["#7"]},"bodyDigest":"8f2c1a90b4d7","newDigest":"c41b7e0a91f6","verified":true}
```

```
$ fabrika ledger retopology 3 --body-digest c41b7e0a91f6 --token <claim-token>
ledger retopology: #3's topology already names exactly its 2 live child(ren) — no PATCH was issued.
{"answer":"unchanged","epic":3,"children":2,"phases":2,"dropped":{"count":0,"rows":[]},"bodyDigest":"c41b7e0a91f6","newDigest":"c41b7e0a91f6","verified":true}
```

**Grounding**

- The refusal it ends is `lane emit`'s `16` (`src/lane/emit-verb.ts`, seated on
  `TOPOLOGY_FOREIGN` in `src/lane/codes.ts`), and that refusal now names both escapes: this verb,
  and `lane emit --children`, which routes around the stale block instead of repairing it.
- One reader serves both escapes — `readDeclared` — so "which refs survive a descope" is answered
  in one place. Two copies of that walk would be two answers to one question.
- The region module exists because v1 cut from the `## Dependencies` heading to end-of-file and
  destroyed a body. This splice is bounded, and bounded at the parser's own boundary rather than
  the plan splice's: a heading-only bound would swallow a dated amendment filed under a `---`.

## `ledger digest`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika ledger digest 3 --token <claim-token>
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<number>` | positional integer | yes | — | the epic whose live body is hashed |
| `--token` | string | yes | — | the claim token `build claim <epic> --purpose plan` printed — which lane is asking |
| `--repo` | string | no | `resolveRepo`'s precedence | the repository read |

**Output** — machine.

```
{"answer": "digest", "epic": 3, "bodyDigest": "8f2c1a90b4d7"}
```

**What it is for.** `--body-digest` had one source: `ledger open`, which allocates the run
directory, seeds `children.jsonl` and refuses `20` on a tree behind the trunk. Inside a plan run
that is right — `draft` and `write` run in the run `open` allocated. For `ledger retopology` it was
a contradiction: that verb's whole claim is that it needs no staged plan run, and the only way to
obtain its required digest was to stage one, so the route `operate/SKILL.md` sanctions for a
wedged `16` could not be executed as written. This verb is the digest and nothing else.

Order of operations:

1. **Open the ground** — the same `openGround` every sibling runs: the repo, the `type:epic` check
   (`10`), the tree root, and this lane's claim (`15`). It allocates no run directory and reads
   none.
2. **Hash the live body** through the shared `bodyDigest` (`src/ledger/digest.ts`) — the same
   function `open`, `draft`, `write` and `retopology` call, so a value printed here and a value
   recomputed there can differ only because the body moved, which is what `21` is for.

**It writes nothing** — no directory, no file, no issue. Two runs a second apart are one call, and
a digest read here goes stale the moment anyone edits the body, which the guarded verb proves
rather than assumes.

**Exit status** (beyond the universal four)

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the epic is proven absent or closed |
| `10` | the issue is not a `type:epic` |
| `11` | the epic, the tree or the claim could not be read — the digest is UNKNOWN |
| `15` | this lane does not hold the epic's claim |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `ledger digest: #<n> is not a type:epic — no verb in this group is held to its body digest.` | 10 | refusal |
| `ledger digest: cannot read #<n>: <reason> — the digest is UNKNOWN.` | 11 | refusal |
| `ledger digest: this lane does not hold #<n>'s claim.` | 15 | refusal |
| `ledger digest: #<n>'s body digests to <hex> — carry it to \`ledger retopology\` before the body moves.` | 0 | note |

**Scope** — one epic body read. Zero scope is `7`: an epic proven absent or closed.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika ledger digest 3 --token <claim-token>
ledger digest: #3's body digests to 8f2c1a90b4d7 — carry it to `ledger retopology` before the body moves.
{"answer":"digest","epic":3,"bodyDigest":"8f2c1a90b4d7"}
```

**Grounding**

- The gap it closes: the sanctioned operator repair route required a body digest, and the only verb
  that printed one staged the whole plan run that route disclaims needing.
- It computes nothing of its own. A second implementation of the hash would be a second answer to
  the question `21` exists to settle.

## Completeness self-test

Per the [interface convention](../../docs/cli-interface-convention.md) Part 2: every flag carries a
type and default; every stdout shape has a literal example; every non-zero code is enumerated with
its trigger (the shared matrix owns each code's single meaning, the per-verb tables own the
triggers, and the universal `0`/`1`/`126`/`127` are stated exactly once); every enumerated code has
an Errors row; every judging verb states its scope and its zero-scope behavior; no clause defers to
a v1 script, another skill's prose, or the authoring session — every cross-reference is to a
**landed sibling fabrika contract or a shipped module by path**.

The four hand-checks the presence tests cannot perform:

1. **Every reachable outcome has a code or a state word.** Walked per verb, including the modes v1
   had no name for: a stale base (`20`), an epic body that moved (`21`), a plan region that cannot
   be resolved (`22`), a created-but-unlinked child (`23`), a topology that does not round-trip
   (`24`), and a write whose inputs were never staged (`25`). The deliberate non-codes are the
   dedup `outcome` and `mode`, which are **answer fields** on an exit-`0` answer because the verb
   did answer.
2. **Every example value is derivable.** The digests from §The body digest's definition (and the
   examples use different literals because they are taken over different bodies); `mode`,
   `outcome`, `answer` and `containment` from their closed sets; the edge orientation and the
   rendered block from §The ledger grammar; the child's `observed` labels from the flags that
   created them. `comment` and the child number are server-assigned and named as such.
3. **Every value a later verb needs arrives as an argument or off an artifact — nothing is
   remembered.** `--body-digest` is threaded explicitly from `open` to `draft` and `write`, and
   from `ledger digest` to `retopology` — the repair route has its own source because `open`'s
   copy arrives only with a staged run. The run
   directory is re-derived from `runKey(epic, nonce)` by every verb rather than passed. The child
   set reaches `ledger topology` and `ledger supersede` through `<dir>/children.jsonl`, and the
   staged documents reach `ledger write` through the run directory — so a compaction between
   minting and splicing loses nothing, which is the v1 failure this shape exists to remove.
4. **Sibling verbs guard shared preconditions identically.** Every `ledger` verb runs `resolveTargetRepo`, the
   `type:epic` check (`10`), `assertGround` (`11`), the imported `requireClaim` (`15`) and the
   same `7` trigger, with documented widenings of `7` — `topology`'s empty run manifest,
   `edges`' epic that declares no topology, `retopology`'s epic with no block or no live
   children, `supersede`'s absent or closed child, `defer`'s absent or already-closed child, and
   `adopt`'s absent or closed adoptee — stated
   in their own tables. `open` states the other divergence — it alone proves freshness (`20`) —
   with its reason: the ground is established once and inherited. `13` is seated by no verb here;
   `--require-clean` is `build tree`'s flag at the skill's step 1.
