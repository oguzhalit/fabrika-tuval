# `campaign` — derived CLI contract

**Skill:** [`campaign`](SKILL.md) · **Date:** 2026-08-20

Three verbs under a `campaign` group in `packages/fabrika-cli/`. The
[CLI interface convention](../../docs/cli-interface-convention.md) governs all three; where this spec
and that doc disagree, the doc wins and this spec is the bug.

**`fabrika` calls the retired v1 pipeline CLI nowhere, and neither does the skill.** v1's campaign,
roadmap and roadmap-guard tools were read for their semantics and their scars and are cited
below as grounding; nothing here invokes them and no v1 script is ported. Both trees are deleted in
any case — the deletion test is the reason that is a feature.

**What the roadmap guard already owns is not re-derived here.** `fabrika guard roadmap-guard check`
([`guard/roadmap.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/guard/roadmap.ts)) judges I1–I5: every row
pins an existing milestone by number, exactly one arc is active, every open milestone is claimed,
zero scope fails closed, and a row's state agrees with its milestone's open/closed reality. So no
verb below checks that a milestone exists, that it is open, or that the table is in sync — a second
answer to a merge-gating question is the failure mode, and the skill states the expectation instead
— ask whether the skill needs the answer, or only needs to expect it.

**No campaign state gates a lane.** A campaign is a theme: its row groups work under a milestone and
its `State` cell says whether the theme is being worked. `build pick` and `build claim` read no
campaign state, so no verb here — and no verb anywhere — answers "may a lane open against this
milestone" off this table.

**Bind to the shared reader, not a fourth.** Three readers of this table are already in tree, and
they are not interchangeable. `guard/roadmap.ts` parses both roadmap tables for the I1–I5 invariants;
its `parseMilestoneCell` matches an **unanchored** `/#(\d+)/`, it drops the header **by position**
(`parseSectionRows`'s `rows.slice(1)`), and its `RoadmapRow.milestone` is already resolved to
`number | null`, so the raw pin cell is gone by the time any caller sees a row. `triage/roadmap.ts`
parses the name→milestone join for `triage homes`. And
[`build/scope-admission.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/build/scope-admission.ts)'s
`readCampaigns` reads the same table for `triage homes` — strict `MILESTONE_CELL = /^#(\d+)$/`, header
recognised by its column names rather than its position, and one unreadable row making the whole
table `Malformed` rather than degrading to the rows that parsed.

All three verbs bind to **`readCampaigns`'s parse**, in `build/scope-admission.ts`. It is the strict
parse, so it is the one a writer must not disagree with: a row this skill reports or writes and the
strict parse calls `Malformed` is a campaign that reads as declared to one reader and unreadable to
another. Binding to `guard/roadmap.ts` instead would buy exactly that divergence — a second number in
the cell is a pin to the guard's loose parser and `Malformed` to the strict one. The guard's looser
parser is not a bug to fix here; it serves invariants that judge a pin's referent, and re-pointing it
is outside this skill's lane.

**But `readCampaigns` itself is a narrowing, and these verbs need the rows it narrows away.** Its
`Dispatch` result carries `ActiveCampaign[]` — only the rows whose state cell is `active`; `paused`
and `done` rows are validated and then dropped, so an all-`paused` table comes back `None`. `campaign
list` has to print those rows and count them, `campaign open`'s `19` has to see a duplicate against a
`paused` row, and `campaign state`'s selector has to find one to flip. Reading `Dispatch` for any of
those is not a narrower answer, it is the wrong one.

**So the parse is extracted and both callers share it — one parser, still not a third.** Implementing
these verbs means splitting `build/scope-admission.ts` in one place, before any writer is added:

- Export `parseCampaigns(text: string): CampaignTable`, holding today's loop **unchanged** — the same
  `MILESTONE_CELL`, the same `isHeader`, the same whole-table `Malformed` on the first unreadable
  row — but pushing **every** parsed row rather than only the `active` ones:
  `CampaignTable = {_tag: "Rows"; rows: ReadonlyArray<CampaignRow>} | {_tag: "Malformed"; reason: string}`,
  with `CampaignRow = {milestone: number; state: CampaignState; name: string}`. An absent heading and
  a table with no rows both give `{_tag: "Rows", rows: []}`; who calls that `none` is the caller's
  question, below.
- Re-express `readCampaigns` as the narrowing over it, keeping its `Dispatch` signature and its
  `Active`-is-non-empty invariant exactly: `Malformed` passes through, otherwise filter `rows` to
  `state === "active"` and return `None` for an empty filter. Its type still makes "active while naming
  no campaign" unconstructible.
- The three verbs here call `parseCampaigns`. The write half is new — nothing in the tree writes this
  table today — so the writers are added beside that parse, never as a fourth one carrying copies of
  its regexes.

**A roadmap with no `## Campaigns` table, or one whose table has no rows, is a state `campaign open`
writes into rather than refuses.** `list` calls both `none` at exit 0, so both are ordinary states of
a live file, and a repo adopting fabrika reaches the first one on its very first campaign. The bytes
are specified in `campaign open`'s Behaviour block; leaving them to the implementer is how one
implementation scaffolds the heading and another refuses.

## Verb inventory

| Verb | Purpose | Split test |
|---|---|---|
| `campaign list` | the `## Campaigns` rows, parsed, optionally narrowed to one state | parse a fixed, documented table grammar and print it — judging the rows is `roadmap-guard`'s, and choosing what to do about them is the skill's |
| `campaign open` | append a new `paused` row pinning a milestone, past the approval trace | the row's bytes, its insertion point and the trace check are fixed; *which* campaign to name is the founder's, and it arrives as an argument |
| `campaign state` | rewrite one row's `State` cell, past the approval trace | a one-cell rewrite with a closed value set, a duplicate-write refusal and a read-back; deciding to flip is the ruling this verb demands a citation for |

`open` and `state` are deliberately **not** fused into one upsert. Naming a campaign and saying it is
being worked are separate acts, each with its own cited ruling; a verb that did both on one call
would re-open in code exactly what the grammar keeps apart.

## Shared conventions

- **Answer channel: machine.** Stdout carries the answer and nothing else. Notices, scope lines and
  refusal reasons go to stderr.
- **Common inputs.** `--file <path>` is the roadmap file; absent, it resolves `.fabrika.jsonc`'s
  `roadmapFile` (`config/keys/paths.ts`), itself defaulting to `ROADMAP.md` at the repo root.
  **`roadmapFile` is a plain path key with no declined form** — unlike `decisionsDir`, it cannot be
  written `null` to say this repo keeps no roadmap; `null` and `""` are both *malformed* there. So
  `22` is the config seat: `.fabrika.jsonc` could not be read, or its `roadmapFile` will not decode,
  and no roadmap file was opened. `--repo <owner/name>` (default: resolved from the env then the
  `origin` remote) is the repository a cited comment must belong to. **The env fallback is
  `CLAUDE_PIPELINE_REPO`, then `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`**, which is `io/issues.ts`'s existing
  `resolveRepo` order and is not re-implemented here; with the flag absent and neither variable set,
  the `origin` remote is read, and a repo that resolves from none of the four is `13` — authority is
  UNKNOWN, because a citation cannot be bound to a repository nobody could name. `--json` swaps the
  line grammar for one JSON object with the keys named per verb.
- **Row line grammar.** Every verb that prints a row prints it as
  `#<milestone>\t<state>\t<name>`, one row per line, newline-terminated, in table order. This is the
  single shape; `open` and `state` print the row they just read back in it.
- **Reserved exit codes.** `0` = the answer is on stdout. `1` = usage error, or the verb failed to
  run. `126` = no implementation resolved. `127` = the verb never ran. `2` is allocated by nothing.
  `3`+ are proven outcomes.
- **One exit table for the whole group.** Every verb allocates from `campaign/codes.ts`.

  | Code | Meaning | list | open | state |
  |---|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
  | `0` | the answer is on stdout | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
  | `1` | usage error, or the verb failed to run | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
  | `7` | the selector names no row on the table | | | ✓ |
  | `8` | the write to the roadmap file failed, so the file may be half-written — UNKNOWN | | ✓ | ✓ |

  Four seats hold the meanings `report`'s table gives them, and the group **imports all four
  constants from `report/codes.ts`** rather than restating numerals, exactly as `triage` and `review`
  do: `NO_TARGET` (`7`) — the target is not there; `WRITE_UNKNOWN` (`8`) — the write itself failed,
  so the outcome is UNKNOWN; `READBACK_MISMATCH` (`9`) — the write landed and the read-back
  contradicts it; `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN` (`11`) — a read failed before anything was attempted. The
  group registers those four in
  [`exit-code-alignment.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/exit-code-alignment.ts) under its
  own names, as `RECIPE_SEATS` and `PATTERN_SEATS` already register the same write-then-read-back
  pair.

  **`8` and `11` are two different facts and the split is the point.** `11` is *nothing was
  attempted*; `8` is *a write was attempted and its outcome is unknown, so the table may be
  half-written*. Seating a failed write on `11` would report a possibly half-written `ROADMAP.md` as
  an untouched one — the silent-failure shape every refusal line in this contract is written to
  avoid. `9` is the third fact: the file is written, it is readable, and it does not say what the
  verb wrote.

  `3`, `4`, `5`, `6` and `10` are left **unallocated** so alignment stays cheap, and this group's
  private band is `12`–`22`. `4` is in that list deliberately rather than by omission — nothing here
  reaches it, and a later verb of this group allocates it fresh. A private code carries no cross-group
  obligation: `12` here is *the campaigns table is unreadable*, and `triage`'s and `review`'s `12`
  are two other namespaces, not a collision.
- **A non-zero exit is UNKNOWN.** No verb prints a partial or permissive answer on a non-zero exit.
- **GitHub access follows [skill conventions §11 — REST, never GraphQL](../../docs/skill-conventions.md)**,
  paginated. The collaborator-permission read is `permissionFor`'s
  (`repos/<repo>/collaborators/<login>/permission`) and the control-plane roster is
  [`ship/roster.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/ship/roster.ts)'s `controlPlaneRoster` —
  `.github/CODEOWNERS` on the default branch, each `@org/team` owner expanded through its member
  list. Neither is re-implemented here, and nothing GitHub-facing is local to this group.
- **Nothing here writes to GitHub.** Every verb's only write is to the roadmap file; the board is
  read at most.

## The `## Campaigns` table grammar

Pinned in `ROADMAP.md` itself, restated here only as the shape the writers bind to; where the two
differ, `ROADMAP.md` is the source and this is the bug.

Columns are `Campaign | Milestone | State`, in that order. `Campaign` is the founder-voice name.
`Milestone` is `#<number>` — the join key, never the title. `State` is one of `active`, `paused`,
`done`, lowercase.

**Every line under the heading that is neither the header nor the `|---|` separator is a data row,
whatever it contains.** The header is recognised by its three column names (`campaign`, `milestone`,
`state`, case-insensitively) and the separator by its dashes; the scan stops at the next `##`
heading. Recognising rows this way rather than by a shape test is what makes a mistyped cell
*malformed* rather than *invisible* — a parser that skipped rows it could not read would answer
"nothing is active" for a broken table, a well-formed answer that is always wrong. That is
`parseCampaigns`'s rule and the writers keep it.

**A data row is readable only when it has exactly three cells, a non-empty first cell, a second cell
matching `^#(\d+)$`, and a third cell that lowercases to one of the three states.** Any row failing
any of those four makes the **whole** table unreadable (`12`) — not just the row, and not just a bad
state cell. No reader falls back to the rows it could parse, so a partial answer is
the one thing no verb here may return. The refusal carries `parseCampaigns`'s own reason string, so
`campaign list` and `triage homes` name the same defect in the same words.

**An absent table and a table with no rows are one well-formed default, and they are a fact rather
than a failed read.** `campaign list` answers `none` at exit `0` for both. This is the deliberate
exception to the fail-closed-on-zero-scope rule: nothing declared is a real state of a repo, and it
refuses nothing. A judging verb would red here; `list` supplies an input and its empty answer is
a fact, which is the distinction the interface convention's rule 4 asks every verb to settle in its
header.

**A table whose every row is `paused` or `done` is a different input, and `list` does not call it
`none`.** It prints those rows, because they are declared: someone opened each one and the file says
so. What is empty there is the *active* answer — `readCampaigns` returns `None`, and no theme is being
worked. The two are only one state when read through that narrowing, which is exactly the read a
report verb must not borrow: `none` from `list` means **no row survived**, never "nothing is active".
`--state active` is how a caller asks which themes are being worked, and on such a table it does
answer `none`.

## The approval trace

The single source for what `--cites` proves. Both write verbs run it before touching the file.

**The artifact** is one GitHub issue or pull-request comment, named by its URL, whose **first line**
is the marker:

```
campaign-approve: #<milestone> active · 2026-08-20T04:11:09Z
```

**Grammar.** The comment body is split on `\r?\n` and only the **first** element is matched:

```
/^\s*\*{0,2}\s*campaign-approve:\s*#(?<milestone>\d+)\s+(?<state>active|paused|done)\s*·\s*(?<ts>\S+?)\s*\*{0,2}\s*$/i
```

Emphasis-tolerant at both ends (`**campaign-approve: #<milestone> active · …**` matches), keyword
case-insensitive, separator the middle dot `·` (U+00B7). `<ts>` must additionally match
`/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}(?:\.\d+)?Z$/` **and** parse: `Number.isFinite(Date.parse(ts))`.
A regex-shaped but calendar-invalid date (`2026-02-30T00:00:00Z`) is malformed.

**The timestamp is compared to nothing.** There is no staleness window, no ordering and no binding
against the comment's own `created_at`; it is evidence a human reader dates the ruling by, and its
only mechanical job is to make the marker a deliberate line rather than a phrase somebody typed in
passing. Stated because a validated input with no stated effect is where one implementer adds a
freshness rule and another does not. v1 ordered candidate approvals by timestamp because
it scanned a whole label for them; a cited URL names exactly one, so there is nothing left to
order.

**Why the first line, and why the body is split rather than matched whole.** v1's docs said first
line and its implementation required the whole body to *be* the marker, so a founder who wrote their
approval and then explained it read as `malformed`. Matching `body.split(/\r?\n/)[0]` is the
fix, and it closes the inverse at the same time: a marker quoted mid-body inside somebody else's
comment is a quotation, never a grant. Both directions are load-bearing, so the anchor is neither
loosened to whole-body matching nor tightened back to a marker-only body.

**Binding.** `<milestone>` must equal the milestone of the row being written and `<state>` must equal
the state the write produces — `paused` for `campaign open`, the `--to` value for `campaign state`.
An approval of one campaign never authorizes another, and an approval to pause never authorizes a
start. That state binding is this contract's own derivation, not v1's: v1's marker named a wave label
and a direction was implicit, which would let one grant re-start a campaign any number of times.

**Authority — two clauses, both required**, because the control-plane set narrows the repo's ACL
and never replaces it.

1. **The control-plane set.** The comment's author login is resolved against the accounts
   `.github/CODEOWNERS` names on the default branch — `@user` owners as named, `@org/team` owners
   expanded to their members — case-insensitively. It is the same roster `plan approve` and
   `decision rule` read. Not in the set is `16`; a CODEOWNERS naming no owner is `17`. A roster that
   could not be read is `13`.
2. **The live ACL.** The same login's repository permission is then read live at the moment of the
   act — `permissionFor(repo, login)`
   ([`io/pulls.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/io/pulls.ts)) — and must be one of `admin`,
   `maintain`, `write`. Below that floor is `21`, and `permissionFor`'s `404` — a **proven** "not a
   collaborator", deliberately not folded into its unreadable arm — is `21` too, under the same
   message with `no collaboration` in the level slot. A permission read that fails any other way is
   `13`: authority is UNKNOWN and nothing is written.

`build clear`'s pair is the shape being copied, constant for constant:
[`build/clearances.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/build/clearances.ts) holds
`WRITE_FLOOR = {admin, maintain, write}` over the same `permissionFor` and the same roster, and its
refusal reads *"authority is the ACL's, never CODEOWNERS' alone"*. The two clauses are conjunctive and
neither substitutes: being in the roster grants nothing to an account with no collaboration, and
holding `write+` grants nothing to an account CODEOWNERS does not name.

**Clause 2 is load-bearing here specifically, and not a formality.** Team membership is edited in
org settings with no pull request, so the roster alone is a list somebody can change outside review.
The live read is what an account actually holds at the moment of the act; the marker's presence is
evidence, never permission.

**Repository binding.** The cited URL must resolve under `--repo`. A comment in another repository is
`15`.

**Precedence when more than one thing is wrong** is most-informative-first, so the caller is told the
furthest thing they got: `21` (a well-formed, correctly-bound marker by a control-plane author who is
below the write floor) > `16` (a control-plane miss) > `15` (malformed or misbound) > `14` (no marker
at all). `17` outranks all four — with no control-plane owner named, no comment could have carried
authority, so reporting `absent` would send the caller hunting for a marker that could not have
helped. `21` sits at the top
because it is the furthest a citation gets: everything about the comment was right and the account
behind it is not a collaborator here, which is a different person's problem than any of the others.

**What it cannot prove, stated so no reader assumes it.** That the founder meant this grant for this
write. A comment re-cited from months ago, or one whose marker was written without reading what it
authorized, passes every check above. The skill carries that as judgment; the verb carries the
checks.

### `campaignAuthors` — retired

`.fabrika.jsonc`'s `campaignAuthors` used to be clause 1's set. It is retired: the set is the
control-plane roster above, and the key is read only to name it. A repository that still declares it
keeps a valid config and gets one stderr line from each write verb, before its other output:

``campaign <verb>: `campaignAuthors` in .fabrika.jsonc is deprecated and ignored — the control-plane set in .github/CODEOWNERS decides this now; remove the key.``

The key changes nothing: an author it names who is outside the roster still refuses on `16`, and an
author it leaves out who is inside the roster is admitted.

## `campaign list`

**Split test:** deterministic. Read the file, run the existing parser, print the rows. No judgment.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika campaign list [--state <active|paused|done>] [--file <path>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--state` | `active \| paused \| done` | no | *(unset — every row)* | print only the rows holding this state |
| `--file` | string | no | `.fabrika.jsonc`'s `roadmapFile`, itself `ROADMAP.md` | the roadmap file to read |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | print one JSON object instead of the line grammar |

**Output** — machine channel. The row line grammar, one row per line, in table order. When no row
survives (an absent table, an empty one, or a `--state` that matches nothing) stdout is the single
line `none` — a positive token, because empty stdout is byte-identical to a verb that never ran.
Under `--json`: `{"rows":[{"milestone":9047,"state":"active","name":"fabrika everywhere"}],"file":"ROADMAP.md"}`,
with `rows: []` for the `none` case.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | the rows, or `none`, are on stdout |
| `1` | usage error (an unknown flag, or a `--state` outside the three values), or the verb failed to run |
| `11` | the roadmap file could not be read |
| `12` | a data row under `## Campaigns` will not parse — wrong cell count, empty name, a milestone cell outside `^#(\d+)$`, or a state outside the three values |
| `22` | `.fabrika.jsonc` could not be read, or its `roadmapFile` will not decode |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `campaign list: cannot read <file>: <reason> — UNKNOWN, nothing was parsed.` | 11 | refusal |
| `campaign list: <file>: <reason> — the whole ## Campaigns table is unreadable.` | 12 | refusal |
| `campaign list: cannot resolve roadmapFile from .fabrika.jsonc: <reason> — UNKNOWN, no roadmap file was opened.` | 22 | refusal |
| `campaign list: --state "<value>" is not one of active, paused, done.` | 1 | usage error |

**Scope** — every row under `## Campaigns` in `--file`. Zero rows is a **fact, not a failed read**:
see the table-grammar section. The scope line goes to stderr and **always counts the whole table, not
the filtered result**, so a `--state` run still says what it read past:
`campaign list: read <file> — <n> campaign row(s), <k> active; printed <m>.` Without `--state`,
`<m>` equals `<n>`.

**Examples**

Both examples run against a `ROADMAP.md` whose `## Campaigns` table holds exactly these two rows:

```
| Taste-Skill Library | #9042 | paused |
| fabrika everywhere | #9047 | active |
```

```
$ fabrika campaign list
#9042	paused	Taste-Skill Library
#9047	active	fabrika everywhere
```

```
$ fabrika campaign list --state done
none
$ echo $?
0
```

```
$ fabrika campaign list --json
{"rows":[{"milestone":9042,"state":"paused","name":"Taste-Skill Library"},{"milestone":9047,"state":"active","name":"fabrika everywhere"}],"file":"ROADMAP.md"}
```

`--json` carries exactly the rows the line grammar would have printed, so `--state done --json` is
`{"rows":[],"file":"ROADMAP.md"}` — the `none` case, with no separate token.

**Grounding**

- **The three states, and the whole-table rule**: one unreadable row makes the whole table
  unreadable, and nothing active means no theme is being worked — it refuses nothing.
- **An empty declaration is a real state of a repo**, which is why zero rows here is `0` and not the
  fail-closed red a judging gate would return.
- `build/scope-admission.ts`'s `parseCampaigns` — the all-rows parse this verb binds to, the one
  `readCampaigns` narrows for `triage homes`, so the report and that reader cannot disagree about
  what a row says.

---

## `campaign open`

**Split test:** deterministic. The row's bytes, its insertion point and the trace check are fixed;
the campaign's name and milestone arrive as arguments, and deciding to declare one is the ruling
`--cites` demands.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika campaign open <name> --milestone <n> --cites <url> [--file <path>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<name>` | string (positional) | yes | — | the founder-voice campaign name, written verbatim into the first cell |
| `--milestone` | integer | yes | — | the GitHub milestone number this campaign pins |
| `--cites` | string (URL) | yes | — | the comment URL whose first line carries the `campaign-approve:` marker |
| `--file` | string | no | `.fabrika.jsonc`'s `roadmapFile`, itself `ROADMAP.md` | the roadmap file to write |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved from the env, then the `origin` remote | the repository the cited comment must belong to |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | print one JSON object instead of the line grammar |

**Behaviour.** The row is appended as the **last** row of the `## Campaigns` table, immediately after
the current last row, formatted `| <name> | #<n> | paused |`.

Two states have no last row, and each has specified bytes:

- **The table exists with a header and no rows** — the row is written immediately after the `|---|`
  separator line.
- **`## Campaigns` exists with no table, or does not exist at all** — the verb writes the heading (if
  absent, as the last `## ` section of the file), then a blank line, then exactly these three lines:

  ```
  | Campaign | Milestone | State |
  |----------|-----------|-------|
  | <name> | #<n> | paused |
  ```

  Nothing else is scaffolded: the prose `ROADMAP.md` carries under its table is founder-voice, and a
  verb that generated it would be writing in a voice that is not its own. The state is always `paused` and there
is no flag to change it: a row that could be written `active` would say the theme is being worked in
the same stroke that names it, which is the shape the two-write rule forbids. Nothing outside
the table is touched — the `## Dependency graph` block is the caller's edit, for the reason in
*Considered and deliberately not derived*.

Order of operations: resolve config → read and parse the file → refuse a duplicate → check the trace
(the control-plane roster, binding, the author's membership, the marker, then the live ACL read) →
write → read back. The trace check
runs before the write and the duplicate check before the trace, so a caller with a bad selector is
never told their citation is fine.

A `<name>` containing `|` or a newline is a usage error: it cannot be written into a table cell.

**Output** — machine channel. The written row, read back, in the row line grammar. There is no empty
answer: a run that wrote nothing exits non-zero. Under `--json`:
`{"row":{"milestone":9047,"state":"paused","name":"fabrika everywhere"},"file":"ROADMAP.md"}`.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | the row was appended and read back, and is on stdout |
| `1` | usage error (unknown flag, missing required flag, a `--milestone` that is not a positive integer, a `<name>` holding `\|` or a newline, or a `--cites` that is not a comment URL), or the verb failed to run |

Every refusal past the read states what did **not** happen. That is v1's discipline and it is kept:
a refusal line that leaves the caller guessing whether a row landed is the one that makes them write
a second.

**Scope** — this verb judges nothing; it writes. Its stderr notice names the two things a reader
needs: `campaign open: cited <url> by @<login> (control plane: <owners>; <level> on <repo>);
appended "<name>" #<n> paused to <file>.`

**Examples**

Against the same two-row fixture, with `.github/CODEOWNERS` naming `@maintainer`, who holds `write`,
and `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>#issuecomment-<comment-id>` a comment by `maintainer`
whose first line is a `campaign-approve:` marker approving milestone 9052 `paused`:

```
$ fabrika campaign open "Reading layout" --milestone 9052 --cites https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>#issuecomment-<comment-id>
#9052	paused	Reading layout
```

```
$ fabrika campaign open "fabrika everywhere" --milestone 9052 --cites https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>#issuecomment-<comment-id>
campaign open: ROADMAP.md already holds "fabrika everywhere" at #9047 — NOTHING was written.
$ echo $?
19
```

```
$ fabrika campaign open "Reading layout" --milestone 9052 --cites https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>#issuecomment-<comment-id> --json
{"row":{"milestone":9052,"state":"paused","name":"Reading layout"},"file":"ROADMAP.md"}
```

**Grounding**

- **A new row is `paused`**, and there is no flag to write it `active`.
- **The control-plane set narrows a live `write+` ACL read**; both clauses run and the verb fails
  closed on either.
- **A cited ruling comment is what makes a human decision actionable by an agent**, and this verb
  applies that same citation idiom to a roadmap write.
- **The marker is anchored to the comment's first line**, so an approval carrying rationale beneath
  it is not malformed, and a quoted approval is not a grant.
- **v1 shipped an unchecked milestone-creating POST whose failure surfaced only as an empty
  number.** Nothing here creates a milestone at all, and every write is read back.
- `roadmap-guard` I1/I3 own whether the pinned milestone exists and whether every open milestone is
  claimed. This verb does not check either.

## `campaign state`

**Split test:** deterministic. Select one row, refuse a no-op, rewrite one cell, read it back. The
decision to flip is judgment, and it enters as a citation rather than as a verb's opinion.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika campaign state <selector> --to <active|paused|done> --cites <url> [--file <path>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<selector>` | string (positional) | yes | — | `#<milestone>`, or a campaign name matched exactly against the first cell |
| `--to` | `active \| paused \| done` | yes | — | the state to write into the row's third cell |
| `--cites` | string (URL) | yes | — | the comment URL whose first line carries the `campaign-approve:` marker |
| `--file` | string | no | `.fabrika.jsonc`'s `roadmapFile`, itself `ROADMAP.md` | the roadmap file to write |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved from the env, then the `origin` remote | the repository the cited comment must belong to |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | print one JSON object instead of the line grammar |

**Behaviour.** Selection is exact, never fuzzy: a `#<n>` selector matches the row whose second cell
pins `<n>`; anything else is matched character-for-character against the first cell after trimming.
Two rows matching is `18` rather than a first-wins pick — a lifecycle flip aimed at the wrong campaign
marks a theme nobody named.

Order of operations: resolve config → read and parse → select → refuse a no-op → check the trace
(the control-plane roster, binding, the author's membership, the marker, then the live ACL read) →
rewrite the third cell → read back. Only the third cell's **state token** changes: the cell's leading
and trailing whitespace is preserved exactly as found and the token is swapped in place, so
`| active |` becomes `| paused |` and `|  active  |` becomes `|  paused  |`. **The cell is never
re-padded to a column width** — `paused` → `done` therefore shortens the line, and every other line
of the file is byte-identical afterwards. Re-padding would be a second, silent edit the caller did
not ask for, and on a table whose columns are already ragged it would rewrite rows nobody touched.

**Output** — machine channel. The rewritten row, read back, in the row line grammar. Under `--json`:
`{"row":{"milestone":9047,"state":"active","name":"fabrika everywhere"},"from":"paused","file":"ROADMAP.md"}`.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | the cell was rewritten and read back, and the row is on stdout |
| `1` | usage error (unknown flag, missing required flag, a `--to` outside the three values, or a `--cites` that is not a comment URL), or the verb failed to run |
| `7` | the selector matches no row |
| `8` | the write to the roadmap file failed — the row may be half-written, so the outcome is UNKNOWN |
| `9` | the file was written and the read-back does not hold `--to` |
| `11` | the roadmap file could not be read, so nothing was attempted |
| `12` | the `## Campaigns` table holds a row that will not parse |
| `13` | the cited comment could not be fetched, the control-plane roster or the author's repository permission could not be resolved, or no repository could be resolved from `--repo`, the env or `origin` |
| `14` | the cited comment's first line carries no `campaign-approve:` marker |
| `15` | the marker is malformed, names a milestone other than the selected row's, names a state other than `--to`, or the cited URL is outside `--repo` |
| `16` | the cited comment's author is not in the control-plane set |
| `17` | `.github/CODEOWNERS` names no control-plane owner |
| `18` | the selector matches more than one row |
| `20` | the selected row already holds `--to` — nothing written |
| `21` | the cited comment's author is in the control-plane set but holds less than `write` on `--repo` |
| `22` | `.fabrika.jsonc` could not be read, or its `roadmapFile` will not decode |

`20` is a refusal and not a quiet `0`. A caller who reads "done" over a cell nobody moved cannot tell
a flip they made from one somebody else made first.

**Scope** — this verb judges nothing; it writes one cell. Its stderr notice:
`campaign state: cited <url> by @<login> (control plane: <owners>; <level> on <repo>); "<name>"
#<n> <from> → <to> in <file>.`

**Examples**

Against the same two-row fixture, with `.github/CODEOWNERS` naming `@maintainer`, who holds `write`, and
`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>#issuecomment-<comment-id>` a comment by `maintainer` whose
first line is a `campaign-approve:` marker approving milestone 9042 `active`:

```
$ fabrika campaign state '#9042' --to active --cites https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>#issuecomment-<comment-id>
#9042	active	Taste-Skill Library
```

```
$ fabrika campaign state 'fabrika everywhere' --to active --cites https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>#issuecomment-<comment-id>
campaign state: "fabrika everywhere" #9047 already holds active — NOTHING was written.
$ echo $?
20
```

```
$ fabrika campaign state '#9042' --to active --cites https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>#issuecomment-<comment-id> --json
{"row":{"milestone":9042,"state":"active","name":"Taste-Skill Library"},"from":"paused","file":"ROADMAP.md"}
```

**Grounding**

- **The flip to `active` says a theme is being worked**, and resuming a paused campaign is that same
  flip. It opens nothing and closes nothing for a lane.
- **The ACL check is the verb's**; the control-plane set only narrows it, and it fails closed on
  either clause.
- **v1 hard-validated its state argument and refused anything else**; the closed value set survives,
  widened to the three states above.
- v1 paired closing the milestone with the flip to `done` and refused to flip over an open milestone.
  Here that check is `roadmap-guard`'s I5 and is **not** repeated: the skill states the expectation
  and the guard holds the verdict, because a second answer to a merge-gating question is the failure
  mode.
- v1's `git switch -c` was deliberately kept out of its scripts, because a script that branches
  mutates whichever checkout the caller happens to sit in. Nothing here branches, commits or pushes
  either.

## Considered and deliberately not derived

One entry per rejected proposal, so none is re-proposed from zero
([skill conventions §7](../../docs/skill-conventions.md#7-the-scope-law--recording-a-rejection)).

**A `campaign verify-trace` verb.** v1 shipped one, and the skill called it as a separate gate before
mutating. Folding the check into both write verbs removes the window where a caller verifies and then
writes something else — or verifies, is interrupted, and writes without checking again. There is
nothing a standalone verb answers that `--cites` does not answer at the moment it matters.

**A campaign drift or sync check.** `fabrika guard roadmap-guard check` already judges I1–I5 over the
same table and the live milestone projection, and it runs at CI. A second answer to a merge-gating
question can contradict the gate, which is worse than no answer at all — the reasoning that dropped
`adr classify` from the `/adr` contract, applied here.

**A "may a lane open against this milestone" verb.** No campaign state gates a lane, so there is no
question for such a verb to answer. Whether an issue may be built is `build`'s admission test, and a
campaign's state is not one of its axes.

**A milestone creator, and a wave-homing verb.** v1's campaign ritual created the milestone and then
PATCHed it onto every issue carrying the wave label. Creating a milestone is board work, and homing
issues onto one is `triage`'s (`triage homes`). Folding either in here would put two skills on one
board mutation.

**A priority normalizer.** v1's campaign ritual deleted `p0`/`p2` and posted `p1` on every open
wave issue. That rule was superseded: campaign membership confers a *home*, never a priority band.
The measured skew it produced was stark — every open `p0` in the queue was factory work with no
product among it, and two sibling issues triaged six minutes apart came out on different bands from
the same rule. Priority is triage's band, set per issue. A campaign verb that re-priced a milestone
would re-seed exactly that skew.

**A `## Dependency graph` regenerator.** The mermaid block is generated content whose generator was
deleted with the v1 verb package, and the roadmap file records that it is hand-maintained until a
fabrika verb owns it again. Writing half of that generator here — a node appended on `open`, a class
restyled on `state` — would put a second partial writer on a block that needs one whole one, and the
partial writer would look authoritative. The skill carries the node-id grammar and the author makes
the edit, until the generator is rebuilt.

**A wave-label-bound trace.** v1 bound approval to an audit wave's label and scanned every issue
carrying it for a marker. fabrika's campaigns are not audit waves and carry no wave label, so the
wave is not an identifier a campaign has. The milestone number is, and it is the single link to the
operational projection, so the marker binds to `#<milestone>` and the caller cites the comment
directly. That also deletes v1's whole scan, with its zero-scope refusal and
its "earliest founder approval wins" tie-break, neither of which has anything left to order.
