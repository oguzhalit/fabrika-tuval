# `/report` — derived CLI contract

**Skill:** [`report`](SKILL.md) · **Date:** 2026-08-01

These verbs live in `packages/fabrika-cli/`, binary `fabrika`, grouped under a `report`
subcommand — the package the [`/adr` contract](../adr/contract.md) mints. The
[CLI interface convention](../../docs/cli-interface-convention.md) governs all three; where this
spec and that doc disagree, the doc wins and this spec is the bug.

**`fabrika` calls `pipeline-cli` nowhere, and neither does the skill** — fabrika reimplements what
it needs rather than shelling out to its predecessor, so no clause here can break when a tool this
package does not own changes. Every verb below is implemented from scratch here. v1's tools were
read for their semantics and their scars — each Grounding section names what the corresponding v1
tool gets wrong and what this spec does instead — but no clause defers to one, and none is
invoked.

**The bare binary name resolves, and this spec assumes it.** The skill's fences invoke `fabrika` as
a plain literal name, which is what the harness's isolation verifier requires — that check is
*syntactic*, on the command string. The name then resolves through the delivery
[`packages/fabrika-cli/docs/packaging.md`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/docs/packaging.md)
documents under *Which copy serves an invocation*: one global install whose binary finds the repo root above the working
directory, asks Node's resolver what copy that root installed, and hands the invocation to it —
including from a git worktree, which resolves to that worktree's own copy. What an eval run still
must not do is grade "the verb is not available yet" as though it were the skill's own behaviour: an
exit 127 means the verb never ran, so it is a broken install to fix, never a verdict.

**A second skill named `report` cannot shadow this one; a second *description* can.** The loader
namespaces plugin skills, so a bare `report` in another roster is that roster's and this one
is reached as `fabrika:report`. What overlaps between two rosters is the **description**, which is
what a model invokes off — and a per-plugin toggle does not settle it, because a skills directory
symlinked into another tree loads as a project-level skill the toggle never reaches. So this
skill's description is deliberately differentiated: it names the guarded posting path and the three
dedup outcomes, and its eval set is what establishes that the differentiation works.

## Verb inventory

| Verb | Purpose | Split test |
|---|---|---|
| `report dedup` | rank the open issues that may already cover an observation | two REST reads, tokenize, score, sort — deciding whether a candidate *is* your observation stays in the skill |
| `report file` | compose, guard and create the intake issue, then read back what landed | the template, the footer, the leak predicate, the classification refusal, the label and the read-back are all mechanical; what goes in the sections is judgment |
| `report note` | add a note to an existing issue over the same guarded path | as above, minus composition — the guard and the read-back are the deterministic part |
| `report amend` | append a dated amendment to an existing issue's **body** over that path | the separator, the dated heading, the guard and the two-halved read-back are mechanical; what the amendment says is judgment |
| `report scratch` | allocate one staging path a body is written into before a literal stdin redirect carries it | deriving an uncollidable path is mechanical; what goes in the file is judgment |

**Considered and deliberately not derived.** Each is a real proposal someone could make again, so it
is recorded rather than left to be re-litigated. (The conventions' §7 puts rejections in a plugin-root
`.out-of-scope/` directory, which does not yet exist for any fabrika skill; bootstrapping it is
corpus-wide work filed separately, and these live here until it does.)

- **A `report compose` preview verb**, emitting the composed body without filing. It would put the
  composed body in the caller's hands — which means a shell variable or a file, and a file is the
  surface every leak in this skill's incident record occurred on. `report file` composes in-process,
  so the composed body exists only inside the process that posts it.
- **A label-vocabulary preflight verb.** Its answer is needed in exactly one place, inside
  `report file`, so it is a precondition rather than a verb; minting it would be a wrapper whose
  only behaviour is relaying an upstream answer, which this group does not mint.
- **A standalone redactor verb.** Same test: a transform with one caller is that caller's
  precondition. It is the `--redact` flag on the three writing verbs.

**The residual this accepts.** Because there is no preview verb, a refusal costs the caller the
whole heredoc again — and re-sending under refusal pressure is exactly the condition that funnels a
caller into the leak-prone form. This spec judges that cost worth paying (a preview verb
reintroduces the leak surface outright, while a re-send is only pressure), and pays it down where it
can: every refusal names one
correctable thing, so the second attempt is a correction rather than a rewrite. The residual is
real and this contract does not close it.

**Nothing here recomputes a merge-gated answer.** The repo's committed-file leak gate decides
whether a *file in a diff* carries a machine-local path, at the merge gate, and that gate is the
authority on that question. An issue or comment body posted at runtime is never in a diff, so no
gate covers it — the predicate below is the ungated surface, not a second verdict on a gated one.

## Shared conventions

Every verb below obeys these; they are stated once rather than repeated per block.

- **Answer channel: machine.** Stdout carries the answer and nothing else. Scope lines, refusal
  reasons and progress go to stderr.
- **Common inputs.** `--repo <owner/name>` (default: `$CLAUDE_PIPELINE_REPO`, else
  `$GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, else the `origin` remote's `owner/name`) is the target repository; with none
  resolvable the verb exits 1 rather than guessing. `--json` swaps the line grammar for one JSON
  object with the named keys given per verb.
- **Reserved exit codes.** `0` = the answer is on stdout. `1` = usage error, or the verb failed to
  run. `127` = the verb never ran. `3` and up are each verb's own proven outcomes.
- **A non-zero exit is UNKNOWN.** No verb prints a partial or permissive answer on a non-zero exit;
  a caller reads the status before the bytes.
- **GitHub access follows [skill conventions §11, "GitHub access is REST, never GraphQL"](../../docs/skill-conventions.md)**
  — REST, paginated, reads and writes alike. The reason lives there, not here.

### The shared exit taxonomy for the writing verbs

`report file`, `report note` and `report amend` allocate codes from **one table**, so a code means
the same thing whichever produced it. A verb that cannot reach a code leaves it unused rather than
compacting the range — a gap is cheaper than a collision.

| Code | Meaning | `file` | `note` | `amend` |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `0` | the write landed, read back clean, and its answer is on stdout | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `1` | usage error, unresolvable repo, or a failed stdin read | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `4` | a required section is missing, out of order, or empty | ✓ | — | — |
| `5` | the body carries a leak — a machine-local path, an email address, or a name `leakNames` declares — and `--redact` was not given | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `6` | the body is a bare `@` path reference — **not** redactable | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `7` | the write target does not exist (`--label` in the repo / `--issue`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `8` | the write itself failed — the outcome is **UNKNOWN** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `9` | the write landed but the read-back does not match | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `10` | the title or `--label` carries a type or priority classification | ✓ | — | — |
| `11` | a precondition read failed — including a `leakNames` that will not decode — so nothing was written | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**`5` and `6` are separate because their fixes are opposite.** The obvious caller loop on a
path refusal is *re-run with `--redact`*; on a body that **is** a path, `--redact` is a no-op and
that loop never terminates. Fusing them would make the leaked-path case this verb exists for the
one a caller cannot get out of.

**`8` is the dangerous one and it is deliberately not `1`.** A create or comment call that times out
or 5xxs may or may not have landed, and the caller has no way to tell from here. Seating it on `1`
would make "GitHub refused the write" indistinguishable from "the binary is broken", which is the
verdict-versus-invocation collision the reserved range exists to prevent. Its message therefore
carries the recovery instruction: **re-run `report dedup` before re-filing**, because a blind retry
is how one observation becomes two issues.

### The body is a value, never a path

The three writing verbs take the body **on stdin only**. There is deliberately **no `--body` flag, no
`--body-file`, and no temp file**: a flag that accepts a path turns the body into a string the verb
could post verbatim, which is precisely how the incidents below happened. A shell redirect
(`< some-file`) is fine and expected — the *shell* reads the file, so what reaches the verb is
already the bytes, and no path ever exists inside the process.

**An empty stdin is a refusal, not an empty body.** A pipe that failed to read is byte-identical to
one that was genuinely empty unless the reader distinguishes them, so the read here does: a
transient read failure is exit `1` (the verb could not run), an empty-but-successfully-read stdin is
exit `3` (a proven refusal). The read must also terminate rather than hang when the verb is invoked
on a terminal with nothing piped in.

**The heredoc is one carrier of that stdin, and not the only sanctioned one.** A heredoc puts the
whole body inside the command string a worktree-isolated shell's verifier grades as one unit, so a
body the verifier refuses is staged rather than trimmed — the three steps, the measured triggers and
the one shape a bounded append still refuses are fixed for every group in
[skill-conventions §4](../../docs/skill-conventions.md#a-body-too-large-for-one-command-is-staged-never-trimmed),
and `report scratch` is the allocator that route names for this group. Staging changes no verb's
interface: the shell reads the file and the verb still receives only bytes, which is why the route
adds no `--body-file` and is not an exception to the rule above.

### The body-surface leak predicate

Shared by `report file`, `report note` and `report amend`. A machine-local path, an email address,
or a name the repo keeps private, in a body posted to a public issue, is a leak. **Four structural
shapes, and names only from the adopter's own config.** The structural shapes need no edit for a new
operator, a renamed tool directory or a different machine. The only names the predicate refuses are
the ones the repo declares under `leakNames` in `.fabrika.jsonc` ([below](#configured-names)); the
shipped default declares none, so no repo, person or number is refused by default.

1. **Home-relative** — a path beginning with the home marker `~` followed by a separator. An issue
   body has no legitimate use for one: the `## Pointers` section is repo-relative by contract. Four
   carve-outs, each pinned to a shape rather than a membership list. Two are the claude CLI's
   public, machine-agnostic config leaves `~/.claude.json` and `~/.claude/settings.json`, which are
   byte-identical on every machine and name nothing operator-specific; because each pins the exact
   leaf, a deeper descent or a longer name still matches. Two are the code shapes a tilde-slash
   path alias takes, which no tool expands to a home folder: a **module specifier** — the path is
   the whole content of a matching `"` or `'` pair that opens in code context, optional whitespace
   before it: after the `from` of an `import`/`export` clause or after a side-effect `import`, where
   the statement begins the line or follows a `;` or a backtick that opens an inline-code span
   (one with an even number of backticks before it on the line); after a `} from`
   closing a multi-line clause; or inside an `import(` or `require(` call — and a
   **path-mapping key** — a quoted path whose last segment is `*`, followed by optional whitespace
   and `:`, the shape of a tsconfig or jsconfig `paths` key. The bare word `from` or `import` in a
   sentence is not code context, so a quoted path after it refuses, including after a closing
   inline-code backtick. A tilde-slash path anywhere
   else refuses, bare or backticked prose included, since nothing there tells an alias from a real
   home path; a filer quotes the alias inside an import line instead.
2. **Absolute home root** — an absolute path under an OS home root: `/Users/<account>` on macOS,
   `/home/<account>` on Linux.
3. **Temp and scratch roots** — `/tmp/<…>`, `/private/tmp/<…>`, `/private/var/<…>`,
   `/var/folders/<…>`. No carve-out: a public issue body has no legitimate bare temp path.

4. **Email** — an address: a local part, `@`, and a dotted domain ending in an alphabetic label.
   Carve-outs, each a shape rather than a person: a role local part (`noreply`, `no-reply`, `git`),
   which is what a commit trailer and an SSH remote carry; a domain RFC 2606 or RFC 6761 reserves
   (`example.com`, `.net`, `.org`, and the `.test`, `.example`, `.invalid`, `.localhost` names); and
   a final label that is a common file extension (`name@1.2.3.patch`, `shot@desktop.png`). Any other
   address refuses, including a forge's per-user noreply address, because its local part names the
   account.

All four are redactable and refuse on **exit 5**. `--redact` replaces a path with
`<class-root>/<redacted>`, so the body still reads as evidence that a path of *that* kind was there,
and an address with `<redacted email>` — whole, because the domain alone can name an employer.

**The matched span is the whole path run, and the mask keeps the class root — never a single
collapsed marker.** Which root a path came from is itself the evidence, so the roots do not fold
together:

| Matched | Redacts to |
|---|---|
| `/var/folders/<…>` | `/var/folders/<redacted>` |
| `/private/tmp/<…>` | `/private/tmp/<redacted>` |
| `/private/var/<…>` | `/private/var/<redacted>` |
| `/tmp/<…>` | `/tmp/<redacted>` |
| `/Users/<account>/<…>` | `/Users/<redacted>` |
| `/home/<account>/<…>` | `/home/<redacted>` |
| `~/<…>` | `~/<redacted>` |

**The leaf filename does not survive**, and that is deliberate rather than an oversight: a filename
can itself identify a person or a machine, and a reader who needs it can ask the reporter. Longer
matches are replaced before shorter ones so an overlapping pair cannot corrupt each other.

<a id="configured-names"></a>**Configured names.** A repo declares the names it keeps out of
public bodies under `leakNames`, with two lists, both empty by default:

```jsonc
"leakNames": {
  "privateRepos": ["<owner>/<repo>"], // the name may appear; a link or a #N reference refuses
  "identifiers": ["<handle>"]          // every occurrence refuses, case-insensitively
}
```

| Declared | Passes | Refuses (class) | Redacts to |
|---|---|---|---|
| a `privateRepos` slug | the bare `<owner>/<repo>` | a `github.com/<owner>/<repo>` link, with or without a scheme, and its whole path (`private repo link`) | `<redacted private repo link>` |
| | | an `<owner>/<repo>#<n>` reference (`private repo reference`) | `<owner>/<repo>#<redacted>` |
| an `identifiers` entry | — | any occurrence (`named identifier`) | `<redacted>` |

A slug matches its own name only — a longer repo name that starts with it is a different repo. An
identifier is literal text, never a pattern. A `leakNames` that will not decode refuses the write on
**exit 11**, never falls back to the empty default, because a typo'd list silently dropped is a
fence the operator believes is standing.

Every redaction is reported on stderr with its line number and class; the verb never rewrites a body
silently.

Separately, and **not** redactable: a body whose first non-whitespace run is an `@`-prefixed path
(`@/…`). That is the composed body having never arrived at all, so it refuses on **exit 6** with its
own message — the fix is to send the body, not to mask a placeholder.

## `report dedup`

Candidate retrieval is advisory. It supplies issues to inspect and never writes to the board.
Runtime invocation, flags and exit codes are in `fabrika report dedup --help`.

### Corpus and freshness

Read the repository label set first. A missing intake label is exit 7; an unreadable label set
is exit 27. Neither produces a negative answer over an undefined queue.

For a usable query, read the open intake queue live and read the issue corpus. The corpus contains
all open issues, regardless of age, plus issues closed within `--closed-days`, default 14.
Zero disables closed retrieval. The cutoff is inclusive and computed in UTC from the run's clock.
The closed API read uses `since` one second before the cutoff to retain the inclusive boundary; admission uses each issue's `closed_at`,
so an old closed issue edited yesterday stays outside the window. Pull requests are excluded.
Both list reads follow pagination and refuse an incomplete walk or malformed issue document.
Shared open-only search helpers used by other commands are unchanged.

Store titles and cleaned body excerpts, at most 800 characters, in a versioned local snapshot.
The cache lives under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/fabrika/dedup`, or `$HOME/.cache/fabrika/dedup` when XDG is
unset, keyed by repository and closed window. Validate the version, repository, window and every
issue before reuse. Reuse lasts less than five minutes from the start of the fetch; reject future
clock values. `--refresh` bypasses reuse. Reapply the moving closed cutoff even on a cache hit.

Missing, unreadable, invalid or expired cache causes a fresh corpus read. A failed refresh never
falls back to stale rows. Publish through a unique temporary file and atomic rename; a cache
write failure still returns the successfully fetched corpus with a diagnostic. Without a cache
location, fetch each time and say so. Directory/file permissions are private to the current user.

A cache hit is a bounded-age observation, not a guarantee of current issue state. The live queue
can add or update rows, but changes outside that queue may take up to five minutes to appear.
GitHub pagination proves the walk completed, not that concurrent changes formed one snapshot.

### Ranking

Use the shared Unicode tokenizer and English/Turkish stopwords, retaining query words beyond the
old twelve-word cap. Fewer than two distinct surviving words returns `indeterminate` without
reading the queue or corpus. Preserve exact or five-character-prefix term matching.

Overlay live queue documents on cached documents by issue number and apply `--exclude` before
ranking. Rank title-only and title-plus-excerpt documents independently with BM25, using k1=1.2
and b=0.75. Term frequency counts occurrences; document frequency counts documents. Strip URLs
and issue-number references from excerpts before truncation.

Take the top 20 positive matches from each ranking, union them, and add `1/(60 + rank)` for each
list where a candidate appears. Ranks start at 1. Sort by fused score descending, then issue number
descending. Apply the caller's `--limit` after fusion. Scores are retrieval scores, not duplicate
probabilities. Queue presence is recorded as source metadata, not a confidence claim.

### Answer

All three outcome tokens exit 0:

- `candidates`: at least one lexical match exists, even if `--limit 0` prints no rows.
- `none`: no lexical match in the observed corpus and live queue. This does not prove no duplicate
  exists under different wording or outside the closed window.
- `indeterminate`: the query did not meet the two-word floor.

Candidate lines have five tab-separated columns:

```text
<number>	<source>	<score>	<state>	<title>
```

Source is `queue`, `index` or `both`; state is `open` or `closed`. Replace tabs and line breaks in
titles with spaces so one issue stays on one line. A closed candidate does not establish that a
current observation was fixed. The caller must read it and compare the actual behavior.

JSON contains `outcome`, `candidates`, `reason`, `tokens`, `truncated`, `retrievalTruncated`,
`queueCount`, `indexCount`, `closedSince` and `cache`. Candidate objects contain the five named
columns. `reason` is null for candidates, otherwise explanatory text. `cache` is
`{source: "cache" | "fetched", ageMs: number}`. It and `closedSince` are null on a non-check;
`closedSince` is also null for open-only runs. Source counts are before exclusion.
The old GitHub-specific `searchTokens` and `searchCount` fields are replaced by this index scope.

`truncated` means the fused union exceeded `--limit`. `retrievalTruncated` means one of the two
ranking lists exceeded its top-20 bound. Both appear separately in diagnostics. The scope line
also names the repository, counts, closed cutoff, cache source/age, query tokens and exclusion.

A queue failure is exit 27 and an index failure is exit 28, with no stdout. If both fail, use 27
and name both failures. Invalid arguments or unresolved repository are exit 1. Cache publication
failure alone is a warning because the fetched corpus remains usable. No failure authorizes an
empty `none`, and no result or failure authorizes automatic closure or blocking a filing.

### Fixed-input stdout examples

These examples fix repository `o/r`, label `status:needs-triage` present, an empty live queue,
`--limit 20`, no exclusion and successful reads. The corpus contains exactly one open issue,
number 4312, title `retry cancellation`, empty body and null `closed_at`. A valid cache fetched
at `2026-09-20T00:00:00.000Z` is reused at that same instant with `--closed-days 0`.
It contains that issue and no other rows. Every block below is stdout only, ending in a newline;
all exit 0. API enumeration order cannot affect a single-document ranking.

`fabrika report dedup --repo o/r --closed-days 0 --query "retry cancellation"` prints:

```text
candidates
4312	index	0.03278688524590164	open	retry cancellation
```

The candidate ranks first in both lists, so its score is `1/61 + 1/61`.
Adding `--json` to that invocation prints this single line:

```json
{"outcome":"candidates","candidates":[{"number":4312,"title":"retry cancellation","state":"open","score":0.03278688524590164,"source":"index"}],"tokens":["retry","cancellation"],"truncated":false,"retrievalTruncated":false,"reason":null,"queueCount":0,"indexCount":1,"cache":{"source":"cache","ageMs":0},"closedSince":null}
```

`fabrika report dedup --repo o/r --closed-days 0 --query "editor cursor"` prints:

```text
none
```

Adding `--json` prints:

```json
{"outcome":"none","candidates":[],"tokens":["editor","cursor"],"truncated":false,"retrievalTruncated":false,"reason":"no lexical matches in the live queue and indexed corpus","queueCount":0,"indexCount":1,"cache":{"source":"cache","ageMs":0},"closedSince":null}
```

`fabrika report dedup --repo o/r --closed-days 0 --query "retry"` prints:

```text
indeterminate
```

Adding `--json` prints the following. Only labels were read, so neither cache nor corpus scope
is asserted:

```json
{"outcome":"indeterminate","candidates":[],"tokens":["retry"],"truncated":false,"retrievalTruncated":false,"reason":"the query yielded 1 distinctive token(s), below the floor of 2","queueCount":0,"indexCount":0,"cache":null,"closedSince":null}
```

### Input validation and failures

`--closed-days` must be a safe integer from 0 through 36500, inclusive. `--limit` must be a
nonnegative safe integer, at most 9007199254740991. Its default is 20; zero retains the outcome
and truncation metadata while returning no candidate rows. Validation runs in this order:
closed days, nonblank query, limit, repository resolution, label read, label existence.
The two-token check follows label validation. CLI parsing errors, such as a missing required
`--query` or a noninteger flag value, use the shared Effect CLI usage diagnostic and exit 1
before this verb runs.

Every failure below has empty stdout. Messages are exact templates; `<repo>`, `<label>` and
`<limit>` substitute the inputs, and `<reason>` is the failed read's diagnostic. The limit
message is retained even for unsafe integers.

| Message | Stream | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| `report dedup: --closed-days must be an integer from 0 to 36500.` | stderr | 1 | usage error |
| `report dedup: --query is empty.` | stderr | 1 | usage error |
| `report dedup: --limit <limit> is negative.` | stderr | 1 | usage error |
| `report dedup: cannot resolve a target repo — set CLAUDE_PIPELINE_REPO, or run inside a checkout whose origin remote resolves.` | stderr | 1 | usage error |
| `report dedup: cannot read the label set of <repo>: <reason> — whether the <label> queue exists is UNKNOWN, and so is the outcome.` | stderr | 27 | refusal |
| `report dedup: <repo> has no "<label>" label — the queue half would scan nothing, so the outcome is UNKNOWN, never "none". Create the label, or pass the one this repo uses.` | stderr | 7 | refusal |
| `report dedup: cannot read the <label> queue in <repo>: <reason>. The outcome is UNKNOWN, never "none".` | stderr | 27 | refusal |
| `report dedup: cannot read the <label> queue in <repo>: <reason> (the index also failed: <index reason>). The outcome is UNKNOWN, never "none".` | stderr | 27 | refusal, both reads failed |
| `report dedup: cannot read the issue index for <repo>: <reason>. The outcome is UNKNOWN, never "none".` | stderr | 28 | refusal |

Cache diagnostics are stderr warnings with an otherwise successful answer, not refusals:
`report dedup: invalid or expired cache; fetching the corpus.`,
`report dedup: cache write failed; using the fetched corpus for this run.`, and
`report dedup: no cache directory available; using the fetched corpus for this run.`
The first warns before a replacement read; if that read fails, the failure table applies.

### Worked cases

- An issue titled "Networking" whose excerpt mentions "retry cancellation" is returned for
  "worker retry cancellation", even though one query word is absent.
- An old open issue remains eligible. An issue closed exactly at the cutoff is eligible; one
  closed a millisecond before it is excluded, even if updated later.
- A fresh cache plus a newly filed intake issue searches the new issue immediately. An expired
  cache plus a failed API read returns UNKNOWN with no candidate output.
- A matching issue from both title and body lists appears once. Excluding it happens before
  either list's top-20 selection, so it cannot consume a candidate slot.

## `report file`

Composes the intake issue from the sections on stdin, guards it, creates it, and reads back what
landed. One transaction: every step below is a precondition or a postcondition of *this observation
is now an issue in the intake queue*, and splitting them would hand a caller the chance to skip one.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika report file --title "Aborted requests in the http worker surface as plain timeouts" [--redact] [--label <name>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

The six authored sections arrive on **stdin** as markdown.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--title` | string | yes | — | the issue title: a short, specific, type-neutral summary of the observation |
| `--redact` | boolean | no | `false` | mask each leak in the body — a path down to its class marker, an email or a configured name whole — and file the masked body, instead of refusing |
| `--label` | string | no | `status:needs-triage` | the single intake-queue label the new issue carries |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved (see Shared conventions) | the repository to file into |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the full filing record instead of the line grammar |
| stdin | markdown | yes | — | the six authored sections, in order |

**The section shape.** The skill supplies the writing prompts — what belongs in each section and why
— and **this verb owns the validated spelling and order**, which is what a drift is caught against:

```markdown
## Summary
## What I was doing
## What I observed
## Why it matters
## Pointers
## Suggested next step (non-binding)
```

All six must be present in this order, each with non-empty content — except
`## Suggested next step (non-binding)`, which may be empty, because a blank guess beats a misleading
one. A missing, misspelled or misordered heading is exit 4 naming the one that is wrong. The skill
necessarily names these headings too (a model cannot author under a section it cannot name), so the
two are a guarded duplicate rather than a single source: this verb is the authority, and exit 4 is
the mechanism that catches the skill drifting from it.

**The footer is appended by this verb**, after the sections and a blank line. Its fields, their
sources, and what happens when each is unset:

| Field | Source | When unset |
|---|---|---|
| `Filed by an agent` | literal | always present — it is the signal, never omitted |
| `session \`<id>\`` | `$FABRIKA_SESSION_ID`, else `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, else `$PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_SESSION` | omitted |
| `model \`<name>\`` | `$ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, else `$CLAUDE_MODEL` | omitted |
| `branch \`<ref>\`` | `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` | omitted when it fails, or returns `HEAD` (detached) |
| timestamp | current UTC time, `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` | always present |

**The separator rule is the whole point of "best-effort".** Fields are joined with ` · ` over the
**present fields only** — a dropped field takes its separator with it. There is no placeholder, no
`unknown`, and no dangling label. Two byte-exact examples, a full footer and a sparse one:

```markdown

```

**Footer privacy is this verb's precondition, not the caller's.** It carries machine and session
context only: no email address, no author name, no filesystem path. It does not read git
`user.email` or `user.name`. A branch name is a ref rather than a path, and is the only
repo-shaped field.

**The classification refusal.** The skill's central invariant — intake applies no type and no
priority — is defended structurally here, not only in prose, because a hand-applied classification
is indistinguishable from a triaged one downstream:

- **`--label` may not resolve to a type or priority label.** Passing `--label type:bug` would
  otherwise sail through the read-back, which counts labels rather than reading them.
- **The title may not lead with a classification prefix.** The refusal needs *both* conditions: the
  leading token has a `WORD:` or `[WORD]` shape, **and** that word resolves to the repo's type or
  priority vocabulary. Both together, so `BUG: fix aborts` refuses while `Bug reports from the
  checkout form are lost` files cleanly — the shape alone would reject a legitimate title whose first
  word happens to be a vocabulary term.

The vocabulary is **derived from the target repo's label set**, which this verb already reads for
exit 7, never a hardcoded list that rots. Both refusals are exit 10. Fully-fuzzy non-neutrality
("The abort wiring is broken") is judgment and stays in the skill; the prefix form is a shape and
belongs here.

**Output** — one **tab-separated** line: `<number>`, `<url>`. The number is bare, with no `#` sigil
and no prose prefix, so `cut -f1` yields something a caller can interpolate without stripping
anything. With `--json`, one object with keys `number`, `url`, `label`, `redactions` (a per-class
tally, bounded so the output cannot grow with the input — one `<class>: <count>` entry per leak
class masked, `{}` when none; each hit's own
`line <n>, <class>` note is on the notes channel) and `bodyBytes`.

**Exit status** — allocated from the shared table above. This verb can return `0`, `1`, `3`, `4`,
`5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9` and `10`; `7` is *the `--label` does not exist in `--repo`*.

| `report file: the title leads with the classification prefix "<prefix>" — intake files type-neutral titles. Drop the prefix.` | 10 | refusal |
| `report file: --title is empty — refusing to file an untitled report.` | 1 | usage error |

**Scope** — a judging verb on three questions, all fail-closed: *does this body carry a
leak*, *does the intake label exist in the target repo*, and *does the title or label
classify*. The leak scan's scope is the whole composed body including the footer, scanned after
composition so nothing the verb itself appends can escape it. The label and vocabulary checks scope
to the target repo's label set, read fresh. Zero scope is unreachable rather than tolerated: an
empty stdin is exit 3 before any check runs, so none can ever report clean over nothing. The scope
line on stderr names the byte count read, the sections seen, the label checked and the size of the
vocabulary derived.

**The read-back is not optional, and its comparison is normalized.** After the create, the verb
re-reads the issue and asserts four things: it exists; it carries `--label` and only that label;
its body contains the `Filed by an agent` marker and all six headings; and its body matches what
was composed **after normalizing line endings to `\n` and stripping per-line trailing whitespace**.
A create call's own response is the server echoing the request; a fresh read is the only evidence
the issue is in the queue.

The normalization is a stated concession, not a preference: byte-identity is the intent, but
**this spec does not assert that the GitHub issue round-trip preserves bytes exactly** — that is an
unverified claim about a dependency, and asserting it would fire exit 9 on every clean filing if it
is false. The implementer verifies the round-trip against the real API and tightens the comparison
to byte-identity if it holds, recording what was found.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika report file --title "Aborted requests in the http worker surface as plain timeouts" <<'EOF'
## Summary
An aborted request's interruption reaches the downstream handler carrying nothing about why, so a
cancelled call is indistinguishable from a call that timed out.

## What I was doing
Tracing a flaky integration test in the web worker's http layer.

## What I observed
`interruptOnAbort` interrupts the request fiber but never carries the signal's `reason` with it.

## Why it matters
Every cancellation reads as a timeout, so time is spent chasing latency on calls the caller already
abandoned. Might also be why the flake only shows under load.

## Pointers
src/http/interrupt-on-abort.ts

## Suggested next step (non-binding)
Maybe carry the signal's `reason` onto the interruption.

**Grounding**

- **The leaked path.** A pull-request body once shipped a literal, unexpanded body-file reference:
  the machine-local path landed in a public artifact and the description was empty, so the leak and
  the missing body were one mistake. Exit 6 is that exact byte pattern, refused separately from
  exit 5 because its fix is to send the body rather than to mask a placeholder.
- **The unverified post.** A raw file-referencing post produces the same literal path *and* a
  self-reported PASS over a body that never landed. Both halves are answered here: the predicate
  refuses the body, and the read-back refuses the false success. A create that decodes only the
  create call's own response, and never re-reads the issue, reports success on a create that landed
  without its label; exit 9 is that designed out.
- **The refusal funnel.** A blocked posting command retried through the file-referencing form this
  contract forbids is how a permission refusal funnels an agent into the leak-prone shape. The
  verb's half of the fix is that its refusals name one correctable thing each; the skill carries the
  other half, because no verb can stop a caller from abandoning it.
- **The swallowed read.** A stdin read that swallows a transient failure to empty makes an unread
  pipe byte-identical to an empty one, and a tool that decides over no evidence does it on exactly
  that. Exit 3 is the empty-but-read case and exit 1 the failed read; they are never the same
  answer.
- **The shared temp file.** The body never becomes a named path, so two concurrent runs have no
  shared file to interleave and no variable to reuse stale. The hazard has no surface rather than a
  warning against it, which is why there is no `--body-file` flag to add later.
- **The never-auto-close marker.** `Filed by an agent` is that signal. GitHub authorship
  cannot serve it: every pipeline-filed issue goes through one shared login, so authorship reads the
  same for a hand-typed issue and an agent-filed one. That is why the marker is the one footer field
  that is never dropped.
- **v1's `leak-guard` cannot see an issue body, and where it can see a body it looks after the
  fact.** Its file scan is scoped by suffix to committed docs and shell scripts
  (`packages/pipeline-cli/src/tools/leak-guard/leak-guard.ts`), and an issue body is never a
  committed file, so this whole surface is off it. Its `scan-pr` leg does reach comment bodies —
  but by re-reading what has **already landed** on a public PR, which its own header states is
  the point: a check no emit path can bypass, moved to the ship-it preflight. Detection after the
  path is public is the scar. Exit 5 is it designed out: the predicate is a precondition of the
  create, run in-process over the composed body, so the path is refused before it is public rather
  than found once it is. The two are complements — this verb keeps its own writes clean, the v1
  guard still backstops every write it does not own.
- **v1's report skill never checks that the queue label exists.** Its `vocabulary-preflight` tool is
  consumed by `doctor`, `homing-guard` and `pitch-guard` and by nothing on the filing path, so a
  repo missing the label files an issue that silently never enters the queue. Exit 7 folds that
  check into the one place it is needed.
- **v1's `tracker create-issue` prints `tracker: created #<n> — <url>`** — prose on a machine
  channel — so callers regex the number back out of it and mangle the reference. The line here is
  tab-separated with a bare number for that reason.
- **v1 defends type-blindness in prose only**, across a `## What you are NOT doing` section and a
  paragraph of warnings, with nothing mechanical behind it. Exit 10 is the shape-checkable half of
  that invariant moved into the verb.

## `report note`

Adds a note to an existing issue over the same guarded path. **This verb exists because the skill
tells its caller to comment on a duplicate rather than file a twin** — and a skill that says that
without providing a guarded path sends the caller to a hand-rolled posting call, which is the exact
call the leaked-path and unverified-post cases each made. Both were comment posts, not issue
creates.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika report note --issue 9412 [--redact] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

The note arrives on **stdin** as markdown.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--issue` | integer | yes | — | the issue number to add the note to |
| `--redact` | boolean | no | `false` | mask each leak in the note — a path down to its class marker, an email or a configured name whole — and post the masked note, instead of refusing |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved (see Shared conventions) | the repository the issue lives in |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the full note record instead of the line grammar |
| stdin | markdown | yes | — | the note body |

**No section template applies, and no footer is appended.** A note is free prose — what the existing
issue lacks — so this verb validates nothing about its structure. Stated explicitly because the
sibling verb does both, and an implementer would otherwise have to guess whether the six sections
bind here.

**Output** — one **tab-separated** line: `<comment-id>`, `<url>`. With `--json`, one object with
keys `id`, `url`, `issue`, `redactions` (the same per-class tally as `file`) and `bodyBytes`.

**Exit status** — allocated from the shared table above. This verb can return `0`, `1`, `3`, `5`,
`6`, `7`, `8`, `9` and `11`; `7` is *`--issue` names no issue in `--repo`*. Codes `4` and `10` are
structurally unreachable here and are left unused rather than reassigned.

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `report note: stdin was read and held 0 bytes — refusing to post an empty note.` | 3 | refusal |
| `report note: could not read stdin: <reason> — the note is UNKNOWN, never empty.` | 1 | refusal |
| `report note: the note carries <n> leak(s) — refusing to post them to a public issue.` (then one indented `line <n>, <class>` per hit) | 5 | refusal |
| `report note: cannot read \`leakNames\`: <reason> — which names this repo keeps private is UNKNOWN, so nothing was posted.` | 11 | refusal |
| `report note: the note is a bare "@" path reference — the composed note never arrived. Send it on stdin; --redact does not apply.` | 6 | refusal |
| `report note: <repo> has no issue #<n>.` | 7 | refusal |
| `report note: could not post the comment on #<n>: <reason> — the note is UNKNOWN. Re-read the issue before re-posting; the comment may have landed.` | 8 | refusal |
| `report note: posted comment <id> on #<n> but the read-back is wrong: <what differs>. The comment exists and needs fixing by hand.` | 9 | refusal |

A **closed** issue is not a refusal — a note on a closed issue is sometimes exactly right — but the
verb says so on stderr (`report note: #<n> is closed.`) so the caller is never surprised by where
the note landed.

**Scope** — a judging verb on one question, fail-closed: *does this note carry a leak*. Its scope is the whole note as read from stdin. Zero scope is unreachable: an empty stdin is
exit 3 before the scan runs, so the guard can never report clean over nothing. The scope line on
stderr names the byte count read and the target issue.

**The read-back applies here too**, on the same normalized comparison as `report file` and for the
same stated reason. After posting, the verb re-fetches the comment and asserts its body matches what
was sent. The failure this answers is precisely a posted comment whose landed body was not what the
poster believed it had sent, reported upward as a success — so a post that is not verified is not
finished.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika report note --issue 9412 <<'EOF'
Also reproduces on the streaming path, not just the buffered one — same discarded `cause`.
EOF
5154891644	https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/9412#issuecomment-5154891644
```

```
$ fabrika report note --issue 9412 --json < note.md
{"id":5154891644,"url":"https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/9412#issuecomment-5154891644","issue":9412,"redactions":{},"bodyBytes":94}
```

```
$ printf '' | fabrika report note --issue 9412
report note: stdin was read and held 0 bytes — refusing to post an empty note.
$ echo $?
3
```

```
$ fabrika report note --issue 99999 < note.md
report note: acme/storefront has no issue #99999.
$ echo $?
7
```

**Grounding**

- **Both leaks were comment posts, not issue creates.** A guarded issue-create path with an
  unguarded comment path leaves the seam where they actually happened wide open, which is this
  verb's whole reason to exist.
- **The read-back half** applies identically to a note: a landed body that is not what was sent,
  reported as a success, is the failure mode. Exit 9 is that made mechanical.
- **The stdin distinction** is the same as `report file`'s: a failed read and an empty pipe are
  different answers with different exit codes.
- v1's `tracker create-comment` prints `tracker: commented on #<n> (ref <id>).` — prose on a machine
  channel, the same scar as its create sibling, and the reason this line is tab-separated with a
  bare id.

---

## `report scratch`

Allocates the staging file a body is written into when a heredoc cannot carry it. It writes no
content and posts nothing.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika report scratch --slug body
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--slug` | string | yes | — | the file's leaf name: kebab-case, ≤5 words, no path separators |

**Output** — machine. Exactly one absolute path on stdout, newline-terminated:
`<OS temp root>/fabrika-report/<allocation-id>/<slug>` — the fixed `fabrika-report` segment
namespaces the allocator against everything else in the temp root. The directory is created if
absent.

**The key is a fresh id per call, and that is what differs from the sibling allocators.**
`build scratch` and `triage scratch` key their namespace on a claim nonce, which they have because
their callers hold a lane. A reporter files mid-task and holds no claim, so there is no nonce to key
on — and a session id alone is the shared-namespace clobber those two verbs exist to prevent, since
a fan of reporters runs under one session. A fresh id makes a collision unconstructible instead. The
cost is that the path is **not re-derivable**: a second call answers a different directory, so a
caller stages and redirects using the one literal path a single call printed.

**Exit status** (beyond the universal four)

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `29` | `--slug` carries a path separator, is not kebab-case, or exceeds 5 hyphen-separated words |

`29` rather than the `10` `build scratch` uses for the same refusal: `10` is `CLASSIFIED` in this
group's shared writing table, and one code meaning two things would break that table's only
property.

The slug predicate is the one `build branch` and `build scratch` use, so the word cap comes with it
rather than being this verb's own rule — which is why the refusal names all three bounds it
enforces instead of the two that are obvious from the flag's name.

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `report scratch: --slug "<value>" must be a kebab-case leaf with no path separators (lowercase letters, digits, single hyphens, ≤5 words).` | 29 | refusal |
| `report scratch: cannot create <dir>: <reason>` | 1 | refusal (the universal `1` — the verb failed to run) |

**Scope** — not a judging verb. Creates one directory, prints one path, writes no file content, and
reads neither GitHub nor a claim.

**Example**

```
$ fabrika report scratch --slug body
/tmp/<redacted>/fabrika-report/<redacted>/body
```

**Grounding**

- The staged-body route and its measured triggers live in
  [skill-conventions §4](../../docs/skill-conventions.md#a-body-too-large-for-one-command-is-staged-never-trimmed);
  this verb is that route's allocator for this group and restates none of it.
- The printed path is machine-local by definition: it must never appear in a posted artifact, and
  `report file`, `report note` and `report amend` red on it (`5`).
- A fixed leaf under the session scratchpad is banned — that directory is shared by every concurrent
  filing, so a name of your own is a name a sibling writes too.

---

## `report amend`

Appends a section to an existing issue's **body**, under a separator and a dated heading this verb
composes. **It exists because there was no public verb for that operation, and the hand-rolled call
that filled the gap posts a path.** `gh api -X PATCH -f body=@file` takes its value as a raw string,
so the literal `@/path/to/file` becomes the whole body and the write returns success — twice on one
day, both self-caught inside a minute. The plumbing was already in the package; what was missing
was a reachable seat for it, since `triage enrich` is stage-scoped and cannot serve an
append to an already-triaged issue.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika report amend --issue 9412 [--redact] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

The amendment arrives on **stdin** as markdown.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--issue` | integer | yes | — | the issue number whose body the amendment is appended to |
| `--redact` | boolean | no | `false` | mask each leak in the amendment — a path down to its class marker, an email or a configured name whole — and append the masked section, instead of refusing |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved (see Shared conventions) | the repository the issue lives in |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the full amend record instead of the line grammar |
| stdin | markdown | yes | — | the amendment section, without its heading |

### The envelope, pinned

The verb composes the separator and the heading, so no caller invents its own and two amendments on
one issue read as one document. Given a prior body `P` and a section `S` amended on `2026-08-21`,
the posted body is **exactly**:

```
<P, with trailing whitespace trimmed>

---

## Amendment — 2026-08-21

<S, trimmed>
```

with a single trailing newline. `P` is otherwise **verbatim** — no reflow, no re-heading, and no
redaction of text this verb did not author. On a prior body that is empty or blank the separator is
omitted and the amendment stands alone: a rule over nothing renders as a stray horizontal line.

The date is **UTC**, so two machines amending the same issue on the same day agree on the heading.
Two amendments on one day therefore produce two identical headings; that is accepted rather than
disambiguated, because the `## Amendment — <date>` form is the one
[`build`'s prose rubric](../build/references/prose.md) already pins, and the reader of an issue body
reads it top to bottom rather than by heading lookup.

**It never replaces a body.** GitHub keeps no issue-body history, so a replaced body is a lost one —
which is what both incidents actually destroyed. There is no flag that makes this verb overwrite.

**Output** — one **tab-separated** line: `<issue>`, `<url>`. With `--json`, one object with keys
`issue`, `url`, `redactions`, `appendedBytes` and `bodyBytes`.

**Exit status** — allocated from the shared table above. This verb can return `0`, `1`, `3`, `5`,
`6`, `7`, `8`, `9` and `11`. Codes `4` and `10` are structurally unreachable here and are left
unused rather than reassigned.

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `report amend: stdin was read and held 0 bytes — refusing to append an empty amendment.` | 3 | refusal |
| `report amend: could not read stdin: <reason> — the amendment is UNKNOWN, never empty.` | 1 | refusal |
| `report amend: the amendment carries <n> leak(s) — refusing to append them to a public issue.` (then one indented `line <n>, <class>` per hit) | 5 | refusal |
| `report amend: cannot read \`leakNames\`: <reason> — which names this repo keeps private is UNKNOWN, so nothing was appended.` | 11 | refusal |
| `report amend: the amendment is a bare "@" path reference — the composed section never arrived. Send it on stdin; --redact does not apply.` | 6 | refusal |
| `report amend: <repo> has no issue #<n>.` | 7 | refusal |

| `report amend: cannot read #<n> in <repo>: <reason> — whether the issue exists is UNKNOWN, so nothing was written.` | 11 | refusal |
| `report amend: could not write the body of #<n>: <reason> — the amendment is UNKNOWN. Re-read the issue before retrying; the append may have landed.` | 8 | refusal |
| `report amend: wrote the body of #<n> but the read-back is wrong: <what differs>. The issue exists and needs fixing by hand.` | 9 | refusal |

A **closed** issue is not a refusal — a correction on a closed issue is often exactly the point — but
the verb says so on stderr (`report amend: #<n> is closed.`).

**Scope** — the leak scan reads the **appended section only**, never the prior body. Scanning the
prior body would make an append a rewrite of text this verb did not author, and `--redact` would
then silently edit someone else's words. Zero scope is unreachable: an empty stdin is exit 3 before
the scan runs. The scope line on stderr names the bytes read and the size of the prior body.

**The read-back proves both halves.** After the PATCH the verb re-reads the issue body and asserts
the appended section is present **and** the prior body survived, on the same normalized comparison
`report file` uses. The write's own echo is not evidence — a write that echoes what it sent proves
only what it sent — and a landed body missing the prior text is a replacement wearing an append's
shape, with no history to recover
it from. A read-back that could not be **performed** — the issue answers 404 after the write, or the
re-read fails — is reported through that same one message, as `the read-back itself failed:
<reason>` or `the issue is not readable after the write` in the `<what differs>` clause, exactly as
`report note` and `report file` report theirs. The exit stays `9`: the body was mutated and nobody
has proven what is in it.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika report amend --issue 9412 <<'EOF'
The fanout classifier landed last week; this issue's `Pointers` section predates it.
EOF
9412	https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/9412
```

```
$ fabrika report amend --issue 9412 --json < correction.md
{"issue":9412,"url":"https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/9412","redactions":[],"appendedBytes":112,"bodyBytes":1904}
```

```
$ printf '' | fabrika report amend --issue 9412
report amend: stdin was read and held 0 bytes — refusing to append an empty amendment.
$ echo $?
3
```

**Grounding**

- **The two incidents** are the reason this verb exists: `-f` posts its value as a raw string, so
  `body=@file` ships the literal path. Both bodies were briefly destroyed and both were repaired
  fix-forward.
- **`restWrite`** ([`packages/fabrika-cli/src/io/gh-api.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/io/gh-api.ts))
  sends the body as JSON on the wire, so no `-f`/`-F` argv shape exists inside the CLI at all. This
  verb is how a caller reaches that path instead of rebuilding the argv one.
- **An earlier ticket for the same hazard** was killed because its deliverable hung off retired
  predecessor surfaces; the hazard outlived the ticket, which is why it is answered here.
- **The pull-request-description instance** of the same byte pattern is covered by `build pr-body`.
  Exit 6 is the shape both share.
