# `/write-pattern` — derived CLI contract

**Skill:** [`write-pattern`](SKILL.md) · **Date:** 2026-08-10

The verbs sit under a `pattern` subcommand group in `packages/fabrika-cli/`, whose binary is
`fabrika`. The group name was verified free against
[`registry.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/registry.ts) at authoring time — at the time of
writing the registered groups are `adr build epic hook ledger plan report review review-ui ship
spend status triage ui wire`, though that list grows most weeks, so read the file rather than this
sentence. The [CLI interface convention](../../docs/cli-interface-convention.md) governs all five verbs;
where this spec and that doc disagree, the doc wins and this spec is the bug.

**`fabrika` calls `pipeline-cli` nowhere, and neither does the skill.** Every verb below is
implemented in `packages/fabrika-cli/`, and no fence in `SKILL.md` invokes anything else — fabrika
reimplements what it needs rather than shelling out to its predecessor, so no clause here can break
when a tool this package does not own changes. v1's `canon` skill and the four tools it shipped
with were read for their semantics and their scars — several are designed out below — and none is
called. The reason is the deletion test: a fabrika that calls v1 can
never be the thing that replaces it.

## Three questions deliberately not derived

Each is already answered by something with more authority. Computing a second answer to a
merge-gating question is strictly worse than computing none, which is the test that dropped the
pilot's `adr classify`.

**Markdown link resolution — the repo's own link gate owns it.** A gate of that class walks every
tracked `*.md` repo-wide through an offline link checker, fails closed on zero scope — a gate that
scanned nothing has judged nothing — and runs on both `pull_request` and `push` to the default
branch so a break is charged to the commit that caused it. A pattern doc is inside that scope
already.

**Machine-local path leakage — the leak gate owns it.** `.patterns/` is a shared-artifact doc
surface to it (`DOC_DIRS` in
[`leak.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/guard/leak.ts)), so a
leaked path in a pattern doc already reds a merge. The skill states the expectation and computes no
second verdict. It deliberately does **not** direct `fabrika build check --surface prose`, whose
`prose` validators are these same two scans: that verb requires a session, a repository token and a
held lane claim (`requireSession` and `resolveTargetRepo` in its module), none of which a bare
authoring run has — and reaching for it would put another group's exit codes inside this skill's
terminal vocabulary, where `15` means something else entirely.

**Backticked bare repo-path resolution — declined, and this is the sharpest of the three.**
`pipeline-cli pointer-guard` solves precisely this problem and **deliberately excludes
`.patterns/**`**. Its own source states why, and the reason has not changed:

> `.patterns/**` is excluded too: besides the same drift it would surface, its prose cites
> *external* dependency source trees (`packages/effect/src/Effect.ts`, `packages/fate/src/server/live.ts`)
> that are not in-repo paths and are indistinguishable from a deleted in-repo package by resolution
> alone — an irreducible false-positive source.

A `pattern`-side copy would inherit that false-positive rate over the exact corpus it targets. So no
verb here judges whether a cited path resolves. `pattern drift` **uses** resolution, but only to
decide what it may follow, and an unresolved token is reported in its own count and never treated as
a finding — the avoidance inherited rather than the defect repeated.

## Verb inventory

| Verb | Purpose | Split test |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern corpus` | the library at a base ref: every doc, its index registration, its section, its last-touching commit | scan a tree, parse table rows, read git log — deciding whether a *missing* doc should exist is the skill's |
| `pattern drift` | whether the in-repo source a doc cites moved since the doc was last written | extract tokens, resolve, diff a commit range — judging whether a move *invalidates* the prose is the skill's |
| `pattern anchor` | whether the dependency version a doc declares still matches what the workspace pins | parse a fixed line, look up a map key, compare two strings — deciding what to rewrite is the skill's |
| `pattern new` | scaffold `.patterns/<slug>.md` from the canonical template | fixed text with substitutions; only the content is judgment |
| `pattern register` | insert the doc's row into `.patterns/index.md` under a named section | *which* section is judgment supplied as an argument; the fenced row edit and its read-back are mechanical |

**Considered and not derived.**

- **A heading-grammar check over a pattern doc.** The corpus has no shared skeleton — 83 docs, no
  frontmatter, headings that vary by layer — so a grammar check would encode this repo's habits as
  law and fail in the foreign repos fabrika ships into. `pattern new`'s template is a *starting
  shape*, not a validated one, which is why exit `4` is a deliberate gap below.
- **A stale-marker scan** (v1's `verify-pattern-doc.sh` check 3 flagged `as of`, `currently`, `at the
  time`). Honest prose uses those words constantly and the check ships no allowance, so it is noise
  with a verdict attached. Whether a hedge is stale is a judgment about the sentence, and it stays in
  the skill.
- **A generated-region rewrite of `.patterns/index.md`**, on the `wire/index-doc.ts` model. That file
  is hand-curated, carries per-row commentary, and is edited by lanes this verb cannot see;
  regenerating it would destroy work. `register` inserts one fenced row instead.

## Shared conventions

Every verb below obeys these; they are stated once rather than repeated per block.

- **Answer channel: machine.** Stdout carries the answer and nothing else. Scope lines, refusal
  reasons and progress go to stderr. Every multi-record stdout line opens with a **record-type
  field**, so a caller never has to infer a line's kind from its position.
- **The outcome token is the first field after the record type, and every outcome exits `0`.**
  `corpus`, `drift` and `anchor` lead each line with a record-type field, so their outcome token is
  the second field of the first line; `register` emits one line and leads with its outcome. `corpus`,
  `drift` and `anchor` each answer with one token from a closed set. A caller must never read its own
  informative answer as a failed run — which is exactly the mistake v1's `adr-sweep` makes by exiting
  `1` on the one case it was asked to produce.
- **Two different reads, deliberately.** `corpus`, `drift` and `anchor` read the corpus **at a
  resolved `--base`**, because the question they answer is what this repository already holds.
  `new` and `register` write the **working tree**. A doc created by `new` is therefore invisible to
  `corpus` until it is committed; that is correct and is why `register` never consults `corpus`.
- **Common inputs.** `--dir <path>` (default `.patterns`) is the doc directory. `--base <ref>`
  (default: the trunk, `origin/<the repo's GitHub default branch>`) is the base ref, **fetched before it is read**. `--json` swaps the line
  grammar for one JSON object with the named keys given per verb, on **stdout**.
- **A non-zero exit is UNKNOWN.** No verb prints a partial or permissive answer on a non-zero exit.
  This is not merely a convention here: the shipped `refuse()` helper hardcodes an empty stdout and
  `answer()` hardcodes exit `0`, so **a non-zero exit carrying a machine payload on stdout is not
  constructible** through the sanctioned constructors. Every verb below is designed inside that
  constraint rather than against it.
- **No verb here reads stdin or touches GitHub, and the group needs no token.** The one network
  call any of them makes is the `--base` fetch above; `new` and `register` make none at all. An
  offline checkout therefore cannot answer `corpus`, `drift` or `anchor` — they exit `11`, UNKNOWN,
  which is the correct answer rather than a stale one read off the working tree.
- **Separator.** Multi-field lines are tab-separated.
- **Fixture examples reproduce against a base ref that carries the fixtures.** The examples below
  name fixtures committed in this skill's tree, and the read-at-`--base` rule applies to them like
  anything else: run against an older base, `pattern drift` answers `unborn` and `pattern anchor`
  exits `12`. That is the verbs working, not the examples rotting — and it is the same property that
  makes the answers trustworthy in the first place.

### The shared exit matrix

This table owns `code → meaning` for the group. Per-verb tables below enumerate only that verb's own
proven outcomes and the trigger that produces each; **the universal codes `0`, `1`, `126` and `127` are
stated here exactly once and every verb can also return them.** One fact, one home — a shared matrix
restated per verb is a shared matrix that can drift from itself.

| Code | Constant | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | — | the answer was produced on stdout |
| `1` | — | usage error, or the verb failed to run |
| `126` | — | no implementation could be resolved — the binary was found, the verbs were not |
| `127` | — | the verb never ran at all (unresolved binary) |
| `8` | `WRITE_UNKNOWN` | the write itself failed, so the outcome is UNKNOWN — deliberately not `1` |
| `9` | `READBACK_MISMATCH` | the write landed and the read-back does not match; the artifact exists and needs a human |
| `10` | `OFF_VOCABULARY` | a value is outside a closed set this group validates against |
| `11` | `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN` | a precondition read failed, so nothing was written and no outcome is proven |
| `12` | `DOC_ABSENT` | proven: the named slug has no doc file |
| `13` | `ALREADY_EXISTS` | proven: the target path already exists — refused, never overwritten |
| `14` | `MULTI_LINE_DIFF` | the edit would have changed a line beyond the one row — aborted before writing |
| `15` | `INDEX_UNPARSEABLE` | proven: the index is absent, or holds no parseable table |
| `16` | `SECTION_AMBIGUOUS` | proven: the named section matches more than one heading — the index needs disambiguating, not the flag |
| `17` | `SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REFUSED` | proven: a supplied source checkout cannot yield complete portable grounding evidence; nothing was written |

**The seats map to register.** `pattern` declares exactly these four shared seats, and this is the
map the alignment registry needs — an implementer should not have to infer it:
`{WRITE_UNKNOWN: 8, READBACK_MISMATCH: 9, OFF_VOCABULARY: 10, PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN: 11}`. The
constants are imported from `build/codes.ts` rather than from `report/codes.ts` directly because
`build` re-exports the base's values unchanged and already carries `OFF_VOCABULARY`, which `report`
seats as `CLASSIFIED`; the value is the base's either way, so the alignment holds.

**Alignment.** `pattern` aligns to the `report` base, importing `WRITE_UNKNOWN`,
`READBACK_MISMATCH`, `OFF_VOCABULARY` and `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN` from `build/codes.ts` rather than
restating numerals, so a drift is unrepresentable rather than merely detectable. The alignment buys
something real, though not what an earlier draft claimed: this skill does **not** drive
`fabrika build check`. What it shares with `build` is the failure *vocabulary* — a failed write, a
mismatched read-back, an off-vocabulary value, a precondition that could not be read — and those
four facts mean the same thing wherever they are proven. A conductor sweeping a doc lane across both
groups reads one meaning per code, and a code that meant two things across a sweep is the defect the
courtesy exists to prevent. The rule the
group follows is `ledger`'s: **import a code when two groups prove the same fact; allocate freely
when they do not.** Registering a `pattern/codes.ts` obliges a matching row in the exit-code
alignment registry and its module map — a group listed nowhere is drift, and the alignment test reds
until both rows exist.

**Deliberate gaps, each with its reason** — a gap that carries information rather than reading as an
oversight:

| Code | Why this group does not seat it |
|---|---|
| `3` `EMPTY_STDIN` | no verb here reads stdin |
| `4` `BAD_SECTIONS` | no verb here validates a document's heading grammar — see *Considered and not derived* |
| `5` `LEAKED_PATH` | the leak gate is the authority over `.patterns/`; this group computes no second verdict |
| `6` `BARE_AT_PATH` | follows from `3` — nothing here composes a body from authored input |
| `7` `ZERO_SCOPE` | **the important one.** No verb here judges over a corpus, so none has a vacuous pass to prevent. An empty or absent `.patterns/` is a *fact* this group reports at exit `0`, and refusing there would leave a repo adopting fabrika unable to write its first pattern doc on the documented path — the first-run dead-end the portability rules forbid, and the same correction `adr next` took when its own empty corpus refused. Where a question genuinely cannot be answered, the group says so in **vocabulary** — `unanchored`, `unknown` — never by falling silent. |

**Private codes are group-local.** `12`–`17` mean what this table says within `pattern` and carry no
cross-group obligation; `review` seats `12` as `STALE_HEAD` and `build` retired its own `12`,
and those are separate namespaces rather than one collision.

## `pattern corpus`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika pattern corpus [--dir <path>] [--base <ref>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--dir` | string | no | `.patterns` | the directory of flat `<slug>.md` pattern docs to read |
| `--base` | string | no | the trunk | the base ref to fetch and read the corpus from; with none named, an unresolvable trunk is `11` |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the corpus as one JSON object instead of the line grammar |

**Output** — machine channel. The first line is the header; `doc` and `dangling` lines follow.

```
corpus	<library|none|absent>	<docs>	<unregistered>	<unknown>	<dangling>
doc	<slug>	<registered|unregistered|unknown>	<section>	<last-sha>	<last-date>
```

`doc` lines are ordered by slug, ascending, byte-wise. `<section>` is the exact heading text the
doc's row sits under, or `-` when the registration state is not `registered`. `<last-sha>` is the
full 40-character sha of the last commit touching that doc's path at or before `--base`, and
`<last-date>` its author date as `YYYY-MM-DD`.

A `dangling` line is emitted for each index row whose **first cell** links a target that is not a doc
in `--dir` — the inverse defect of an unregistered doc. **This is not a link check and does not
overlap the link gate:** a target that fails to resolve at all is the gate's business, and a target
that resolves perfectly well — an ADR, a doc in a subdirectory, a file outside `--dir` — is still
dangling *here*, because the question is membership of this corpus, not reachability. Rows are
emitted in document order.

```
dangling	<link-target>	<section>
```

**The three outcome tokens are facts, and two of them are the adopting-repo case.**

- **`absent`** — `--dir` is not present in the tree at the resolved `--base`. This repo has no
  pattern library yet. Zero `doc` lines follow.
- **`none`** — `--dir` is present and holds no `*.md` file other than `index.md`. The library exists
  and is empty. Zero `doc` lines follow.
- **`library`** — at least one doc.

**Registration is three-valued, and the third value is what keeps a false negative out.**
`registered` means an index table row's first cell links this doc's filename. `unregistered` means
the index was parsed and no row does. **`unknown` means registration could not be determined at all**
— the index is absent, or holds no markdown table — and it is reported for every doc with a note on
stderr. Rendering an unknowable registration as `unregistered` would report a defect this verb never
proved, and would send a caller to add rows to a file that cannot hold them.

**Row parsing is positional, never a region scan.** A doc counts as registered only when a
**markdown table row's first cell** links its filename. A mention anywhere else in the index — a
sentence of prose, a reading-order note, a second cell — is not a registration. v1's check was
`grep -n "$NAME.md" index.md`: unanchored, whole-file, and with `.` as a regex any-char, so prose
passed as a row. Scanning a region and inferring position is the same defect front-door's disposition
parser had to fix.

With `--json`, one object with keys `outcome`, `docs`, `unregistered`, `unknown`, `dangling`,
`entries` (an array of `{slug, registration, section, lastSha, lastDate}`, empty unless `outcome` is
`library`), `danglingRows` (an array of `{target, section}`), `baseRef` and `baseSha`.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `11` | `--base` could not be fetched, or the tree could not be read — the corpus is UNKNOWN, never `none` |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern corpus: cannot fetch <ref>: <reason> — the corpus is UNKNOWN, never "none".` | 11 | refusal |
| `pattern corpus: cannot read <dir> at <ref>: <reason> — UNKNOWN, never "absent".` | 11 | refusal |
| `pattern corpus: cannot read the history of <path>: <reason> — UNKNOWN, never a missing commit.` | 11 | refusal |

**Scope** — every `*.md` file directly under `--dir` at the fetched `--base`, excluding `index.md`,
which is the registry rather than a member of the corpus. (v1's `list-pattern-docs.sh` listed
`index.md` as a pattern doc.) The scope line goes to stderr on every run, naming the base sha, the
directory and the counts.

**Zero scope is an answer here, and the read is what makes that safe.** The corpus is listed out of
the object database at the resolved base sha, and that read **fails outright when the directory is
not in the tree**. So an empty listing is a directory that exists and holds nothing, not a directory
nobody could find — which is precisely the distinction `decisions-index next` does not make when it
computes `max + 1` over an empty entry set and hands a mis-rooted checkout `0001`.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika pattern corpus --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/empty-library
corpus	none	0	0	0	0
$ echo $?
0
```

```
$ fabrika pattern corpus --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/no-library
corpus	absent	0	0	0	0
$ echo $?
0
```

```
$ fabrika pattern corpus --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/empty-library --json
{"outcome":"none","docs":0,"unregistered":0,"unknown":0,"dangling":0,"entries":[],"danglingRows":[],"baseRef":"origin/main","baseSha":"<sha>"}
```

**`no-library` is deliberately not a committed directory** — it is the absent path, and a fixture
that existed could not demonstrate the outcome that fires when one does not.

`doc` lines carry a commit sha and an author date, which are a function of a repository's history
rather than of this spec, so **no example prints them** — an example value that looks verifiable and
is not is worse than no example. The grammar above is the contract; the two derivable outcomes are
shown byte for byte.

**Grounding**

- v1's `list-pattern-docs.sh` carries two scars this verb designs out: it emits its refusals on
  **stdout**, so a caller parsing stdout as the doc list ingests the error text as a filename; and it
  applies no `index.md` exclusion, so the registry lists as a member of the corpus.
- `decisions-index next` computes `max + 1` over its entry set with no proof that the set came from a
  real corpus, so a mis-rooted run answers `0001` and invites an author to overwrite the first
  record. This verb proves the directory by the read itself.
- An empty corpus is a fact for a verb that supplies, not a refusal. The zero-scope red binds a
  **gate**, whose empty scan means it checked nothing; it does not bind a verb whose whole answer is
  what the library holds.
- front-door's disposition parser — parse by cell position, never scan a region and infer position.
  The unregistered/`unknown` split is the same lesson as its `unprobeable` presence state: a state
  that cannot be determined gets its own name rather than being rendered as the negative.

## `pattern drift`

Answers whether the **in-repo source a doc cites** moved since the doc was last written.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika pattern drift worker-queue-retry [--dir <path>] [--base <ref>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<slug>` | positional string | yes | — | the doc's basename without `.md` |
| `--dir` | string | no | `.patterns` | the directory the doc lives in |
| `--base` | string | no | the trunk | the base ref to fetch, resolve the anchor commit against, and diff to; with none named, an unresolvable trunk is `11` |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result as one JSON object instead of the line grammar |

**Derivation** — the computation, in full. Two implementers who read this section follow the same
paths and count the same commits; nothing below is left to judgment.

1. **The subject.** `<dir>/<slug>.md`. If it is absent from both the working tree and the tree at the
   resolved `--base`, exit `12`. If it is present in the working tree and absent at `--base`, the
   outcome is `unborn` — it has never been committed, so there is no anchor to measure from. An
   uncommitted doc is the bootstrap case, not an empty diff; v1's script gets this right and it is
   kept.
2. **Candidate tokens.** From the doc's text at `--base`, take every **backticked span** and every
   **markdown link target**. A candidate is one whitespace-free token.
3. **Filter to unambiguous repo-root-relative paths.** A candidate is dropped when it contains any of
   `* ? { } [ ] ! ( ) < > $ |`, when it carries a `<scheme>:` prefix, or when it does not begin with a
   **repo top-level segment**. The segment set is not hardcoded: it is **every top-level entry in the
   tree at the resolved `--base`**, so the verb works in a repo whose layout is not this one. A bare
   basename and an app-relative fragment are ambiguous shorthand and are left alone — precision over
   recall, at the stated cost of missing a partial pointer.
4. **Partition by resolution at `--base`.** A candidate that names a path present in the tree is
   **in-repo**; one that does not is **unresolved**. `<cited>` counts step 3's survivors, `<in-repo>`
   and `<unresolved>` the two parts.
5. **The anchor commit.** The last commit touching `<dir>/<slug>.md` at or before the resolved
   `--base`.
6. **The moved set.** For each in-repo path, the commits touching it in the range
   *(anchor commit, base sha]*. A path with at least one such commit is **moved**.
7. **Outcome.** `drifted` when the moved set is non-empty. `current` when `<in-repo>` is at least 1
   and the moved set is empty. `unanchored` when `<in-repo>` is 0. `unborn` per step 1.

**An unresolved candidate is never drift, and never a finding.** Pattern prose legitimately cites
external dependency source trees, and such a path is indistinguishable from a deleted in-repo path by
resolution alone. It is counted, named on stderr, and excluded from steps 6 and 7. This verb inherits
`pointer-guard`'s avoidance rather than repeating the false positive it was written to escape.

**`unanchored` is not a clearance.** It says the doc cites nothing this verb can follow, so drift here
is **unanswerable** — read the source by hand. Reporting it as `current` would be a clean pass over
nothing, the shape a zero-scope rule forbids; the group expresses that in vocabulary rather than in
an exit code, because a verb that refused would break the pipe its answer crosses.

**Output** — machine channel.

```
drift	<drifted|current|unanchored|unborn>	<anchor-sha>	<cited>	<in-repo>	<unresolved>	<moved>
path	<repo-path>	<commits>	<last-sha>	<last-date>
```

`<anchor-sha>` is the full sha from step 5, or `-` on `unborn` and on `unanchored` — on
`unanchored` no in-repo path was followed, so the anchor commit bounded nothing and printing it
would imply a range that was never walked. One `path` line per **moved** path
only, ordered by path ascending; an unmoved in-repo path is counted in the header and not listed,
because the header's `<in-repo>` count is what makes the omission readable. `<commits>` is that
path's commit count in the range.

With `--json`, one object with keys `outcome`, `anchorSha`, `cited`, `inRepo`, `unresolved`, `moved`,
`paths` (an array of `{path, commits, lastSha, lastDate}`, empty unless `outcome` is `drifted`),
`unresolvedPaths` (an array of the step-4 leftovers, so a caller can see what was skipped rather than
trusting a count), `baseRef` and `baseSha`.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `11` | `--base` could not be fetched, the tree could not be read, or a git history read failed — the outcome is UNKNOWN |
| `12` | `<slug>` names no doc in the working tree or at `--base` |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern drift: cannot fetch <ref>: <reason> — the outcome is UNKNOWN, never "current".` | 11 | refusal |
| `pattern drift: cannot read the history of <path>: <reason> — the outcome is UNKNOWN, never "current".` | 11 | refusal |
| `pattern drift: no doc for slug "<slug>" under <dir>, in the working tree or at <ref>.` | 12 | refusal |
| `pattern drift: slug "<slug>" is not kebab-case (lowercase letters, digits and single hyphens).` | 1 | usage error |

**Scope** — the in-repo paths the subject doc itself cites, resolved at the fetched `--base`, over the
commit range from the doc's anchor commit to the base sha. The scope line goes to stderr naming the
base sha, the anchor sha, all three counts, and **each unresolved candidate by name**, so a caller can
see exactly what the answer does not cover.

**A pathspec that matches nothing can never read as a clean answer here**, because the paths are
derived from the doc and resolved before they are used, and a doc whose paths all fail to resolve
lands on `unanchored`. v1's script takes its source directories as caller-supplied arguments and runs
`git diff --name-status <last>..HEAD -- "$@"`, which exits `0` with empty output both when nothing
changed and when the pathspec matched nothing — so a typo reads as "nothing drifted", over a path set
the doc was never consulted about.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika pattern drift worker-queue-retry --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/unanchored-doc
drift	unanchored	-	0	0	0	0
$ echo $?
0
```

```
$ fabrika pattern drift worker-queue-retry --json --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/unanchored-doc
{"outcome":"unanchored","anchorSha":"-","cited":0,"inRepo":0,"unresolved":0,"moved":0,"paths":[],"unresolvedPaths":[],"baseRef":"origin/main","baseSha":"<sha>"}
```

```
$ fabrika pattern drift no-such-doc
pattern drift: no doc for slug "no-such-doc" under .patterns, in the working tree or at origin/main.
$ echo $?
12
```

The `drifted` and `current` outcomes print a commit sha, an author date and commit counts — all
functions of a repository's history rather than of this spec — so **no example prints them**, and the
line grammar above is the contract for those two. `baseSha` is shown as `<sha>` for the same reason;
every other field in the JSON example is derivable from the fixture.

**Grounding**

- v1's `pattern-doc-drift.sh` carries four scars, all designed out above: it resolves the anchor with
  `git log -1` against the **local** `HEAD` rather than a fetched base ref; it takes the source
  directories as **caller-supplied arguments**, so the answer is only as good as the caller's memory
  of what the doc describes; its `git diff` exits `0` with empty output on a pathspec that matched
  nothing, so zero scope reads as a clean answer; and its clean case prints **empty stdout**,
  byte-identical to a verb that never ran.
- `pointer-guard`'s `.patterns/**` exclusion — the false-positive class that makes step 4's partition
  necessary rather than fussy, quoted at the head of this spec.
- `.patterns/` has **no drift mechanism today**, and the anchor model (a prose line, new frontmatter,
  or a per-pattern-kind split) is an **open, unruled decision** on a control-plane surface. This verb
  answers only the question it can answer from what the corpus already carries: the commit history
  over the paths a doc itself cites. It settles that open question in no direction and must not be
  read as having done so.
- A verb that exits non-zero on its own informative case makes a caller read a useful answer as a
  failure. All four outcomes here exit `0`.

## `pattern anchor`

Answers whether the **dependency version a doc declares** still matches what the workspace pins. The
git half and the dependency half go stale independently, which is why this is a separate verb rather
than a mode of `drift`.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika pattern anchor worker-queue-retry [--dir <path>] [--manifest <path>] [--base <ref>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<slug>` | positional string | yes | — | the doc's basename without `.md` |
| `--dir` | string | no | `.patterns` | the directory the doc lives in |
| `--manifest` | string | no | `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | the workspace manifest whose default and named catalog maps hold the live pins |
| `--base` | string | no | the trunk | the base ref to fetch and read both the doc and the manifest from; with none named, an unresolvable trunk is `11` |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result as one JSON object instead of the line grammar |

**Derivation** — in full.

1. **Anchor declarations.** From the doc's text at `--base`, every line matching, exactly:

   ```
   ^> Derived from `(?<token>[^`]+)` — re-verify on pin bump\.$
   ```

   The em-dash is literal.

   **A line that opens `> Derived from ` and does not match in full is a `malformed` declaration, not
   a non-declaration.** This is the load-bearing half of the rule. Measured against this repo at
   authoring time, 24 lines match the strict grammar and **9 more do not** — they carry the shape
   `> Derived from the in-repo source (...) + ` then a backticked `<pkg>@<version>` then
   ` where the lib is implicated ...`. Treating those as absent would answer `unanchored` — *"this
   doc claims no dependency anchor"* — for nine docs that visibly claim one, which is a fail-open
   false negative over a quarter of the anchored corpus. Counting them as malformed makes the verb
   say *"something here declares an anchor I could not parse"*, which is true and actionable. It is
   the same discipline `pattern drift` applies to an unresolved path: never silently drop what you
   could not follow.
2. **Split the token.** `<token>` splits at its **last** `@` into `<package>` and `<version>`.
   Splitting at the last rather than the first is what makes a scoped package work: `@nkzw/fate@1.3.1`
   yields `@nkzw/fate` and `1.3.1`, where a first-`@` split would yield an empty package name. A token
   with no `@`, or whose split yields an empty half, is reported `malformed` and counted, never
   guessed at.
3. **Resolve the pin.** Read the manifest as strict YAML. Look up each declared package across
   the default `catalog:` and every named map under `catalogs:`. Block and flow maps are
   supported; package names and pins must be non-empty strings. An absent package is `unpinned`.
   Equal pins across maps count as one. Conflicting pins for a declared package refuse at exit
   `11`, naming the package and versions. A conflict for an unrelated package does not prevent
   an answer. Declarations have no consumer scope, so the reader never chooses one conflicting pin.

   Unreadable YAML or invalid catalog structure is exit `11`, even for an unanchored document.
   Nested version objects, non-string pins and duplicate YAML keys cannot establish a version.
   A readable manifest with named catalogs and no dependency declarations answers `unanchored`.
4. **Compare.** `<version>` against the pinned value, **byte for byte**, with no semver
   interpretation. A doc's anchor records the version its author actually read; accepting a range
   would silently bless a version nobody checked, which is the whole failure the line exists to catch.
5. **Outcome**, by this precedence: `unborn` if the doc is present in the working tree and absent at
   `--base`; else `moved` if any declaration moved; else **`malformed`** if any failed to
   parse; else `unpinned` if any package is absent from the manifest; else `matched` if there is at
   least one declaration; else `unanchored`.

   **`malformed` is its own outcome and does not fold into `unpinned`.** They ask opposite things of
   a caller: `unpinned` says this repo no longer carries the dependency, which is a question about
   whether the doc still applies at all; `malformed` says the anchor line is mistyped, which is a
   one-line repair. Folding the second into the first points a typo at the same remedy as a dropped
   dependency.

   **`unanchored` therefore fires only when the doc carries no `> Derived from ` line at all** — not
   merely when none parsed. That is what keeps step 1's near-miss case from reading as clean.

**`unborn` mirrors `pattern drift` deliberately.** Both verbs take the same positional `<slug>` and
the skill runs them back to back, so one tree state must not produce two different verdicts: a
freshly-written, uncommitted doc is `unborn` on both, at exit `0`. Only a slug with no doc in the
working tree *and* none at `--base` is exit `12`.

**Output** — machine channel.

```
anchor	<matched|moved|malformed|unpinned|unanchored|unborn>	<declared>	<moved>	<unpinned>	<malformed>
pkg	<package>	<declared-version>	<pinned-version>	<matched|moved|unpinned|malformed>
```

**`<declared>` counts every `> Derived from ` line, malformed ones included**, so it is always
`<moved> + <unpinned> + <malformed> + <matched>` and a reader can check the header against itself.
Counting only the well-formed ones would hide the very lines this verb exists to surface.

One `pkg` line per declaration, in the order they appear in the doc. `<pinned-version>` is `-` when
the package is not a catalog key. On a `malformed` declaration **both version fields are `-` and
`<package>` carries the line's text after `> Derived from `, with tabs and newlines stripped and
clamped to 120 characters** — the line is malformed precisely because no `<pkg>@<version>` token can
be split out of it, so there is nothing narrower to print and a truncated echo is what lets a reader
find the line.

**`unanchored` is a fact, not a fault.** Most pattern docs describe in-repo shapes and are anchored to
no dependency at all — a minority of this repo's docs carry a declaration (22 of 83 at the time of
writing, though both numbers move, so count them rather than quoting this sentence). It is reported so a caller
can tell "this doc claims no dependency anchor" from "this doc's anchor is fine", and it is never
reported as `matched`.

With `--json`, one object with keys `outcome`, `declared`, `moved`, `unpinned`, `malformed`,
`packages` (an array of `{package, declaredVersion, pinnedVersion, state}`, empty on `unanchored`),
`manifest`, `baseRef` and `baseSha`.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `11` | `--base` could not be fetched, or the doc could not be read — the outcome is UNKNOWN |
| `12` | `<slug>` names no doc in the working tree or at `--base` |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern anchor: cannot fetch <ref>: <reason> — the outcome is UNKNOWN, never "matched".` | 11 | refusal |
| `pattern anchor: cannot read <manifest> at <ref>: <reason> — every pin is UNKNOWN, never "unpinned".` | 11 | refusal |
| `pattern anchor: cannot read the catalog in <manifest> at <ref>: <reason> — every pin is UNKNOWN, never "unpinned".` | 11 | refusal |
| `pattern anchor: no doc for slug "<slug>" under <dir>, in the working tree or at <ref>.` | 12 | refusal |
| `pattern anchor: slug "<slug>" is not kebab-case (lowercase letters, digits and single hyphens).` | 1 | usage error |

**A manifest that reads but whose catalog this verb could not read is UNKNOWN too** (exit `11`), for
the same reason, including invalid catalog structures in step 3. A manifest that carries
**neither `catalog:` nor `catalogs:`** is the degrade path instead: every declaration reports `unpinned` at exit
`0` with the absence named on stderr, because a repo that pins nothing centrally is a fact about that
repo rather than a failed read. The two are not interchangeable: the degrade line names an absence,
so it is never printed for a manifest that does carry a catalog.

**An unreadable manifest is UNKNOWN and never `unpinned`.** The two are one keystroke apart in
consequence: `unpinned` says the repo does not carry this dependency, and a failed read says nothing
at all. Fusing them is the same defect the `7`/`11` split exists to prevent — a 404 is a verdict, a
5xx is a verdict about nothing. A manifest that is genuinely **absent** is the `dep-manifest`
surface's degrade path: every declaration reports `unpinned` at exit `0`, with the absence named on
stderr.

**Scope** — every anchor declaration in the subject doc, resolved against the default and named catalog maps of
`--manifest` at the fetched `--base`. The scope line goes to stderr naming the base sha, the manifest
path and the four counts.

**Examples**

Both run against fixtures committed in this skill's tree and reproduce byte for byte; the stderr
scope line is not shown. The fixture manifest pins `acme-queue: 4.2.0` and carries no
`@acme/retry` key.

```
$ fabrika pattern anchor worker-queue-retry --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/anchored --manifest packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/anchored/workspace.yaml
anchor	moved	2	1	1	0
pkg	acme-queue	4.1.0	4.2.0	moved
pkg	@acme/retry	2.0.0	-	unpinned
$ echo $?
0
```

```
$ fabrika pattern anchor plain-doc --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/anchored --manifest packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/anchored/workspace.yaml
anchor	unanchored	0	0	0	0
$ echo $?
0
```

```
$ fabrika pattern anchor worker-queue-retry --json --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/anchored --manifest packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/anchored/workspace.yaml
{"outcome":"moved","declared":2,"moved":1,"unpinned":1,"malformed":0,"packages":[{"package":"acme-queue","declaredVersion":"4.1.0","pinnedVersion":"4.2.0","state":"moved"},{"package":"@acme/retry","declaredVersion":"2.0.0","pinnedVersion":null,"state":"unpinned"}],"manifest":"packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/anchored/workspace.yaml","baseRef":"origin/main","baseSha":"<sha>"}
```

**Grounding**

- The declaration grammar is the one **the corpus already carries** — a minority of the docs, in
  exactly this shape; count them at read time rather than trusting a number written here. This verb reads what is there; it does not propose frontmatter or any other anchor model,
  because that choice belongs to the open anchor-model decision and is unruled.
- The anchor model is an open control-plane decision. Matching the existing prose line is the
  conservative floor: it is falsifiable today and it commits nothing.
- The anchor records the exact dependency version its author read. Byte-for-byte comparison
  prevents accepting a different version whose source was never checked.

## `pattern new`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika pattern new worker-queue-retry [--dir <path>] [--title <text>] [--anchor <pkg@version>] [--decision <url>] [--source-repo <path>] [--source-package <name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<slug>` | positional string | yes | — | the kebab-case basename the doc takes, without `.md` |
| `--dir` | string | no | `.patterns` | the directory to write the doc into, created when absent |
| `--title` | string | no | derived from the slug | the H1 text. The derivation: replace each `-` with a space, then upper-case the first character and leave every other character as it is. `worker-queue-retry` becomes `Worker queue retry`; `fate-effect-server` becomes `Fate effect server`. No acronym or digit special-casing — a doc wanting one passes `--title` |
| `--anchor` | string | no | none | a `<pkg>@<version>` this doc is derived from; adds the line `pattern anchor` reads. When source evidence exists it derives this token automatically; an explicit conflict refuses |
| `--decision` | string | no | none | the cited binding decision; selects the prospective scaffold |
| `--source-repo` | string | no | none | a local authoritative Git checkout to inspect before writing; its path is never serialized |
| `--source-package` | string | no | inferred only when unique | the relevant package name; requires `--source-repo` and resolves monorepo ambiguity |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the write record instead of the bare path |

**Output** — one line, the path written, newline-terminated. With `--json`, one object with keys
`path`, `slug`, `title`, `anchored`, `decision`, and `sourceEvidence`. `sourceEvidence` is `null` or
`{origin, commit, package, version, inspected: {source, tests, docs}}`; every path under `inspected`
is repository-relative. The supplied local path is absent from both this object and the scaffold.

The file's bytes are the canonical template, and **this block is that template's single home** — the
skill carries no copy to drift against:

```markdown
# <Title>

<One sentence: what shape this describes, and where in the tree it applies.>

## The shape

<The pattern itself, with a fenced example lifted from a test or a real call site.>

## When this applies

<The current in-repo scope, representative source paths, and the boundary where it stops applying.>

## Why it is not obvious

<What a reader would otherwise invent, and why that version is worse.>
```

With `--anchor`, one more line is appended, and its bytes are exactly the grammar `pattern anchor`
parses: a blockquote marker, `Derived from `, the backticked `<pkg>@<version>`, then
` — re-verify on pin bump.`

With `--decision`, `## When this applies` becomes `## Prospective scope`, followed by a
`## Binding decision` section linking the citation. Its prompts require intended scope and forbid
invented current call sites. With `--source-repo`, the verb first resolves the checkout's Git root,
full `HEAD`, canonical network origin, tracked manifests, and representative source/test/docs files.
It reads those files at `HEAD`, resolves `--source-package` by manifest name (or the sole versioned
public package), then appends this portable grammar plus the ordinary anchor line:

```
> Source checkout evidence: <canonical-origin> at `<full-commit>`; package `<pkg>@<version>`; inspected `<source-path>`, `<test-path>`, and `<docs-path>`.
> Derived from `<pkg>@<version>` — re-verify on pin bump.
```

The current and prospective forms are starting shapes, not a validated heading grammar. Both still
require non-obviousness and a foreseeable worse alternative; obvious narration, generic framework
advice, speculative conventions and intuition-only rules remain below the skill's bar.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `8` | the file could not be written, so whether anything landed is UNKNOWN |
| `11` | the target-path existence check itself failed, so whether `<path>` exists is UNKNOWN — never read as absent, and never `13`, which is proven |
| `13` | the target path already exists — refused, never overwritten |
| `17` | the supplied checkout is absent/unreadable/non-Git, has no parseable network origin, full commit, tracked source/tests/docs, or uniquely resolvable package version, or conflicts with `--anchor`; nothing was written |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern new: <path> already exists — refusing to overwrite.` | 13 | refusal |
| `pattern new: cannot check <path>: <reason> — nothing was written.` | 11 | refusal |
| `pattern new: slug "<slug>" is not kebab-case (lowercase letters, digits and single hyphens).` | 1 | usage error |
| `pattern new: --anchor "<value>" is not <pkg>@<version>.` | 1 | usage error |
| `pattern new: --source-package requires --source-repo.` | 1 | usage error |
| `pattern new: supplied source repository refused: <reason> — nothing was written.` | 17 | refusal |
| `pattern new: --anchor <token> conflicts with source evidence <token> — nothing was written.` | 17 | refusal |
| `pattern new: cannot write <path>: <reason> — whether anything landed is UNKNOWN.` | 8 | refusal |

**Scope** — not a judging verb. It writes exactly one file and never edits another; the index row is
`pattern register`'s, and separating them is what lets a doc land in a repo whose index is missing.
It does not check whether a doc already covers the subject; that is `pattern corpus` and the
skill's judgment.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika pattern new worker-queue-retry
.patterns/worker-queue-retry.md
```

```
$ fabrika pattern new worker-queue-retry
pattern new: .patterns/worker-queue-retry.md already exists — refusing to overwrite.
$ echo $?
13
```

```
$ fabrika pattern new worker-queue-retry --json
{"path":".patterns/worker-queue-retry.md","slug":"worker-queue-retry","title":"Worker queue retry","anchored":null,"decision":null,"sourceEvidence":null}
```

```
$ fabrika pattern new worker-queue-retry --anchor acme-queue@4.2.0 --json
{"path":".patterns/worker-queue-retry.md","slug":"worker-queue-retry","title":"Worker queue retry","anchored":"acme-queue@4.2.0","decision":null,"sourceEvidence":null}
```

**Grounding**

- The template lives here rather than in `SKILL.md` because a template in two places is a template
  that drifts, and the skill's job is the judgment the template cannot carry — the same split
  `adr new` takes.
- Creating `--dir` when it is absent is what makes the `patterns-dir` surface `bootstrap`: a repo
  adopting fabrika has no `.patterns/`, and its first pattern doc has to be writable on the documented
  path. Refusing there is the first-run dead-end the portability rules forbid.
- The `--anchor` line's bytes are pinned to `pattern anchor`'s grammar in one place, so the writer and
  the reader of that line cannot disagree. Source evidence complements this pin-bump anchor rather
  than bypassing it.
- Git always runs with `-C <validated-root>` after root resolution. Evidence contains only the
  canonical origin, full commit, package/version and repo-relative paths, never the supplied path.

## `pattern register`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika pattern register worker-queue-retry --section "Index — Effect domain layer" --topic "..." --read-when "..." [--dir <path>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<slug>` | positional string | yes | — | the doc whose row is inserted, without `.md` |
| `--section` | string | yes | — | the exact heading text, without leading `#`, of the index section the row goes under |
| `--topic` | string | yes | — | the row's second cell: what the doc covers |
| `--read-when` | string | yes | — | the row's third cell: when a reader should open it |
| `--dir` | string | no | `.patterns` | the directory holding the docs and `index.md` |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the edit record instead of the line grammar |

**Output** — one tab-separated line: the outcome token, the path edited, and the section.

```
<inserted|already>	<path>	<section>
```

With `--json`, one object with keys `outcome`, `path`, `slug`, `section` and `row`.

**The row's bytes**, with each cell's tabs and newlines stripped and its pipes escaped as `\|`:

```
| [<slug>.md](./<slug>.md) | <topic> | <read-when> |
```

**Mechanics, in order.**

1. Read `<dir>/index.md` **from the working tree** — this verb edits the tree, so it must read what
   it is about to write. If it is absent, or holds no markdown table under any heading, exit `15`.
2. Refuse to write a row pointing at nothing: if `<dir>/<slug>.md` does not exist in the working
   tree, exit `12`.
3. Locate the section: a heading line whose text, after stripping leading `#` characters and
   surrounding whitespace, equals `--section` exactly. Not found exits `10` and **names every section
   heading that does exist**, in document order and without truncating, so the caller's next
   invocation is a correction rather than a guess. Found more than once exits `16` — a different fact
   with a different remedy, since the flag is right and the index is what needs disambiguating.
4. If any table row anywhere in the index already links `<slug>.md` in its first cell, write nothing
   and answer `already` at exit `0`. Registering twice is a no-op, not an error.
5. Insert the row immediately after the last table row under that heading and before the next heading.
6. **Prove the diff before writing.** The new text must differ from the original by exactly one added
   line and nothing else — no removed line, no modified line. Otherwise exit `14` and write nothing.
7. Write, then read the file back and re-parse it. The row must be present under the named section and
   parse to the same three cells. Otherwise exit `9`.

**The diff fence is the load-bearing step, and it exists because of who else edits this file.**
`.patterns/index.md` is hand-curated, carries prose between its tables, and is edited by lanes this
verb cannot see. An insertion that reflowed a table, normalized a pipe or rewrote a neighbouring row
would destroy work with no diff small enough for a reviewer to notice. Exit `14` is that rule made
mechanical rather than remembered, and it is the deterministic test the implementation owes.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `8` | the write failed, so whether anything landed is UNKNOWN |
| `9` | the write landed and the read-back does not carry the row as written |
| `10` | `--section` names no heading in the index |
| `16` | `--section` matches more than one heading in the index |
| `12` | `<dir>/<slug>.md` does not exist — refusing to write a row pointing at nothing |
| `14` | the edit would have changed a line beyond the inserted row — aborted, nothing written |
| `15` | the index is absent, or holds no parseable markdown table |
| `11` | `<dir>/index.md` (step 1) or `<dir>/<slug>.md` (step 2) could not be read at all, so the precondition is UNKNOWN — never `15` or `12`, which are proven facts |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern register: <dir>/index.md is absent — the doc at <dir>/<slug>.md is written and unregistered; front-door bootstraps the index.` | 15 | refusal |
| `pattern register: <dir>/index.md holds no parseable markdown table — the doc at <dir>/<slug>.md is written and unregistered; front-door bootstraps the index.` | 15 | refusal |
| `pattern register: no doc at <dir>/<slug>.md — refusing to register a row pointing at nothing.` | 12 | refusal |
| `pattern register: cannot check <dir>/index.md: <reason> — nothing was written.` | 11 | refusal |
| `pattern register: cannot read <dir>/index.md: <reason> — nothing was written.` | 11 | refusal |
| `pattern register: cannot check <dir>/<slug>.md: <reason> — nothing was written.` | 11 | refusal |
| `pattern register: slug "<slug>" is not kebab-case (lowercase letters, digits and single hyphens).` | 1 | usage error |
| `pattern register: no section "<section>" in <dir>/index.md (present: <a>, <b>, …).` | 10 | refusal |
| `pattern register: "<section>" matches <n> headings in <dir>/index.md — ambiguous, nothing written.` | 16 | refusal |
| `pattern register: insertion would have changed <n> line(s) beyond the new row — aborted, nothing written.` | 14 | refusal |
| `pattern register: cannot write <path>: <reason> — whether anything landed is UNKNOWN.` | 8 | refusal |
| `pattern register: <path> was written and the read-back does not carry the row — the file needs a human.` | 9 | refusal |

**Scope** — not a judging verb. It reads and writes exactly one file, `<dir>/index.md`, and reads one
more, `<dir>/<slug>.md`, to prove the row's target exists.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika pattern register worker-queue-retry --section "Index — Effect domain layer" --topic "Retry and backoff on the worker queue" --read-when "Adding a queue consumer, or changing a retry policy"
inserted	.patterns/index.md	Index — Effect domain layer
```

Run against the three-section fixture, so the `present:` list is exact and derivable. It is **every**
section carrying a table, in document order, comma-separated — it never truncates, because a caller
correcting a flag needs the whole set:

```
$ fabrika pattern register cache-invalidation --section "Nonexistent Section" --topic "x" --read-when "y" --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/three-sections
pattern register: no section "Nonexistent Section" in packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/three-sections/index.md (present: Index — services, Index — edge, Index — observability).
$ echo $?
10
```

```
$ fabrika pattern register cache-invalidation --section "Index — services" --topic "Cache keys and invalidation order" --read-when "Touching a cached read" --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/three-sections
already	packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/write-pattern/three-sections/index.md	Index — services
$ echo $?
0
```

**Grounding**

- v1's `verify-pattern-doc.sh` checks registration with `grep -n "$NAME.md" index.md` — unanchored,
  whole-file, and with `.` matching any character, so a mention in prose passes as a registration.
  This verb requires a table row's **first cell**, which is the same positional-parse discipline
  front-door's disposition reader had to adopt after a region scan reported a word that was not there.
- The one-line diff fence is `adr supersede`'s, for the same reason: an edit to a file whose other
  content is not yours must prove it touched only what it claimed.
- The read-back is the `report` group's `9`: a write that landed and does not match is an artifact
  that exists and needs a human, and it is neither a success nor a failed write.
- A row pointing at a file that does not exist is a dead link that a link gate will red later and a
  reader will hit sooner. Exit `12` is why the target is proven first.

---

## Namespaces and gates — what this group does not join

`write-pattern` emits **no verdict marker and joins no gate vocabulary.** It is an authoring skill,
not a gate: it produces an edit and the doc gate reviews it like any other. Concretely, and checked
against the shipped code rather than assumed:

- `write-pattern` is not a member of the verdict-marker namespace set, the ship-gate namespace set,
  or the review class names — and it should not become one. Widening those to admit an authoring
  skill would let it emit a verdict about work it performed.
- A `.patterns/*.md` diff classifies as the **doc** surface, so a pull request from this skill gates
  on the doc review namespace. `.patterns/` is **not** a governed root, unlike the decision corpus,
  so a pattern-doc pull request does not carry the governance namespace an ADR does.
- The two questions this contract deliberately does not answer are answered for a `.patterns/` diff
  by the repo's own link and leak gates, named at the head of this spec. No verb here re-answers them
  and this skill invokes nothing to do so.

Stated here to close the question rather than leave it to be rediscovered: no verb in this group
needs a repository token, and none writes to any board surface.
