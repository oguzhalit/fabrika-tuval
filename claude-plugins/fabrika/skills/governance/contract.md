# `/governance` — derived CLI contract

**Skill:** [`governance`](SKILL.md) · **Date:** 2026-08-09

These verbs live in `packages/fabrika-cli/`, binary `fabrika`, grouped under a `governance`
subcommand beside the groups already registered in `packages/fabrika-cli/src/registry.ts` — at the
time of writing `adr`, `build`, `epic`, `hook`, `plan`, `report`, `review`, `review-ui`,
`ship`, `spend`, `triage`, `ui` and `wire`, though that list grows most weeks, so **read the file
rather than this sentence**. `governance` was confirmed free there against a freshly fetched
`origin/main` immediately before this spec landed. The [CLI interface convention](../../docs/cli-interface-convention.md) governs
these verbs; where this spec and that doc disagree, the doc wins and this spec is the bug.

**`fabrika` calls `pipeline-cli` nowhere, and neither does the skill** — fabrika reimplements
what it needs rather than shelling out to its predecessor, so no clause here can break when a tool
this package does not own changes. v1's
`review-doc` Step 4a and its `scripts/adr-sweep.sh`, v1's `review-skill` Step 4 check 4, and the
`class-probe` / `verdict` / `control-plane-paths` / `adr-sweep` tools were read for their semantics
and their scars — each Grounding section names what the v1 counterpart gets wrong and what this spec
does instead — but no clause defers to one and none is invoked.

**Substrate.** Effect CLI verbs on the `@effect/platform-node` seam the sibling groups use; GitHub
access per
[skill conventions §11, "GitHub access is REST, never GraphQL"](../../docs/skill-conventions.md).

## Verb inventory

| Verb | Purpose | Split test |
|---|---|---|
| `governance scope` | whether the diff derives the governance namespace, over which harness roots, with the bound head, the `self` flag, and the decision records the diff touches | matching changed paths against a fixed root set and binding them to a commit is a total function; whether a change weakens a guard is the whole judgment |
| `governance sweep` | the uncited live-`accepted` records whose decision domain a subject touches, ranked, for a subject read out of a bound commit or out of the corpus | the ranking is arithmetic over a corpus; reading the shortlist, and reading the domain the ranking cannot see, is judgment |
| `governance guards` | the anchored invariants the bound diff removes or modifies, and the guard-bearing files it touches | detecting an anchor's removal or mutation in a diff is textual and mechanical; whether the change *weakens* the invariant is judgment |
| `governance base` | this skill's own text at the merge-base of a PR that edits it — the self fence's bytes | resolving a merge base and reading named paths at it is mechanical; judging the PR by those rules rather than the head's is the judgment |
| `governance post` | the single sanctioned emit of the `governance` namespace verdict: compose through the `verdict-marker` wire format, re-resolve the head, append into one comment per head, leak-scan, read back, then re-fire the floor check at that head | marker composition, head re-resolution, the derived-namespace fence and the read-back are a protocol; the polarity and clause are judgment |
| `governance digest` | the decision records that landed in a window, each with its id, title, status, landing commit and whether its diff carried anchored-invariant changes | enumerating merges in a window and reading each record's frontmatter is mechanical; ranking tension and blast radius is judgment |
| `governance readout` | the digest-publishing protocol: compose the ranked rows through the `governance-digest` wire format, upsert them into the durable artifact, read them back | composition, upsert and read-back are a protocol; the rows and their order are judgment |

### Considered and deliberately not derived

Each is a real proposal someone could make again. (Conventions §7 homes these in a plugin-root
`.out-of-scope/`, which no fabrika skill has bootstrapped yet; until it exists they live inline, the
same tracked debt the sibling contracts carry.)

- **A §CP classifier, of any kind — path, content or hybrid.** fabrika's §CP model is
  CODEOWNERS-only, three-valued, `UNKNOWN` treated as §CP, with **no semantic detection**
  ([§CP classification](../../docs/control-plane-classification.md), by founder ruling). The
  boundary is enforced twice in CI — by the repo's own §CP path-boundary job, and by the job that
  re-checks that boundary against the prose describing it — and by GitHub's own code-owner review
  requirement. A second answer here could contradict a merge-gating verdict, and a gate that
  contradicts itself costs more than the extra detection is worth.
  This group computes no §CP answer; the skill states the expectation and nothing more.
  A standing proposal wanted a guard-vocabulary content probe for exactly the case this skill
  owns. It was never accepted, its only mechanism lives inside v1's ship-it Step 0, and fabrika
  resolved the same case **two other ways**: path-set completeness in CODEOWNERS, and this skill's
  judgment. A fabrika content regex would be a third, rival answer.
- **A re-derivation of the ranking algorithm.** `governance sweep` **imports**
  `packages/fabrika-cli/src/adr/sweep.ts` — `decisionBearingText`, `tokenize`, the idf scoring and
  `RARITY_FLOOR` — rather than restating any of it. A second lexical sweep would be a rival answer
  to a solved question. What this verb adds is the subject source: `adr sweep` can only read a local
  draft, and a review-time or digest-time subject lives in a **commit**.
- **A citation-resolution verb.** `fabrika adr resolve` already answers
  `live` / `landed` / `in-flight` / `absent` against a freshly fetched base ref. The skill invokes it
  directly. A `governance resolve` would be a wrapper whose only behaviour is relaying an upstream
  answer, and a wrapper whose whole behaviour is relaying is not a verb.
- **An ADR-number-collision verb.** `fabrika adr next` already unions the merged set with the ids
  open ADR PRs claim and the ids this clone's branch refs carry, remote-tracking ones included — the
  cross-PR and cross-worktree
  read a tree-local guard structurally cannot make. The skill invokes it; this group adds nothing.
- **A dead-link or ADR-index checker.** A repo that arms a link checker and a corpus-index
  validator gates each already. Note what they do **not** cover, because it is this skill's job and
  not a gap in theirs: `lychee --offline` skips `http(s)` by design and `decisions-index validate`
  checks files, never citations, so a PR citing an unlanded ADR passes both green. That check
  reaches the corpus half through `adr resolve`, not through a second link checker.
- **A verdict-conjunction or enqueue verb.** `fabrika ship gate` folds the required namespaces into
  one fail-closed enqueue decision and is the single merge authority. This group emits one
  namespace's verdict and reads none of the others.
- **A blocking digest.** The readout gates nothing, by founder ruling.
  A verb that could red on a digest row would re-create the human gate the ruling retired.

### Nothing here recomputes an enforced answer

The enforced questions are: the §CP path boundary and its CODEOWNERS/prose drift (the repo's own
§CP job and the drift check beside it), the enqueue conjunction over required
namespaces (`fabrika ship gate`, the single merge authority), typecheck/lint/tests, leaks, secrets,
dead links, and ADR-index integrity — each with the workflow or verb that owns it. This spec
computes no second verdict on any of them. The namespace derivation and the contradiction ranking
are **not** enforced at any CI seam — verified by grepping `.github/workflows/` — which is why they
are legitimately verbs here.

### The name situation, and routing

No v1 skill is named `governance`, so there is no name collision. A repo whose skill routing is
pinned to a filesystem path pointing at some other tree reaches none of these skills at all; that is
the repo's own wiring to fix, and no clause here patches it. This skill is reached
as `/fabrika:governance`, and **from inside fabrika it is already routed**: `review`'s SKILL.md §6
directs the model to fire it on a `governance: required` diff — the token `review scope` prints
from this group's own `governedRoots` derivation, never the narrower `harness` flag — and
`review`'s eval set carries a
`governance-seam-derived-required` case.

## Shared conventions

Stated once rather than repeated per block.

- **Answer channel: machine.** Stdout carries the answer and nothing else; scope lines, refusal
  reasons and progress go to stderr. Every "nothing found" case prints a state word — empty stdout
  is byte-identical to a verb that never ran, and v1's `adr-sweep.sh` shipped exactly that: on both
  its guard-abort path and its shortlist path stdout is empty, and the exit code does not separate
  them either.
- **Common inputs.** `--repo <owner/name>` (default: `$CLAUDE_PIPELINE_REPO`, else
  `$GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, else the `origin` remote; none resolvable → exit `1`) — the resolution chain
  the shipped `report`/`triage`/`review` groups already use. `--json` swaps the line grammar for one
  object with the named keys.
- **Every list read paginates and reports its scanned count** on stderr — comments, changed files,
  corpus members. A verdict driven by a silently truncated read is a verdict over unknown scope.
- **A non-zero exit is UNKNOWN.** No verb prints a partial or permissive answer on a non-zero exit.
  This is not merely a convention here: `packages/fabrika-cli/src/verb.ts`'s `refuse()` hardcodes
  `stdout: ""` and `answer()` hardcodes `code: 0`, so a non-zero exit carrying a machine payload is
  **unbuildable** in this package. Every informative outcome below is therefore an exit-`0` token,
  and every non-zero is a bare refusal with its reason on stderr.

### The shared exit taxonomy

All seven verbs allocate from one internal table (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/governance/codes.ts`), so
a code means one thing across *this group*. Every shared seat is **imported**, never restated as a
numeral — a restated numeral is a second source that can drift silently, and an import cannot.
Import exactly as `packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/codes.ts` does, from the modules that actually own
each meaning:

| Seat | Import from | Shipped constant |
|---|---|---|
| `3` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9` `11` | `packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/codes.ts` | `EMPTY_STDIN`, `LEAKED_PATH`, `BARE_AT_PATH`, `NO_TARGET` (re-exported here as `ZERO_SCOPE`, the same rename `review` uses), `WRITE_UNKNOWN`, `READBACK_MISMATCH`, `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN` |
| `10` | `packages/fabrika-cli/src/triage/codes.ts` | `OFF_VOCABULARY`. **The seat is literally the same binding** — `triage/codes.ts` is `export const OFF_VOCABULARY = REPORT_CLASSIFIED`, so there is no numeric difference to hunt for. Import it **from `triage`** anyway, because that is where the meaning this group proves is named; `report`'s spelling, `CLASSIFIED`, means "the title or `--label` carries a type or priority classification" (`report file` only). `review/codes.ts` imports it from `triage` for exactly this reason. |
| `12` `13` `17` | `packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/codes.ts` | `STALE_HEAD`, `INCOMPLETE_SCAN`, `SUPERSEDES_VERDICT` — imported because this group proves the same three facts. `17` in particular *must* be the import: `governance post --base/--tip` and `review post --base/--tip` are one module (`review/range-post.ts`), so a private seat here would hand a caller two codes for a refusal produced by one line of code |
| `4` | declared locally as `DELIBERATE_GAP = 4` | the same shape `review/codes.ts` ships, so the gap is registered rather than silently absent |
| `14` | this group's own | see below |

The group registers in `ALIGNED_GROUPS` in `packages/fabrika-cli/src/exit-code-alignment.ts` **and**
in the `TABLES` record in `packages/fabrika-cli/src/exit-code-alignment.unit.test.ts` — two files,
not one; registering only the first leaves that test red. Codes were read from the **shipped
package**, never from a sibling `contract.md`.

| Code | Meaning | scope | sweep | guards | base | post | digest | readout |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `0` | the answer is on stdout | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `1` | usage error, unresolvable repo, or the verb failed to run | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `126` | no implementation could be resolved | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing | — | — | — | — | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| `4` | *(deliberate gap — `report file`'s body-section seat; no verb here composes body sections)* | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| `5` | the **authored** text carries a machine-local path | — | — | — | — | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| `6` | the **authored** text is a bare `@` path reference — not redactable | — | — | — | — | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| `7` | zero scope: the target is **proven absent (404)** or closed, the PR has zero changed files — declared, or in the local three-dot read a verb derives from — the corpus holds zero decision records, the window holds zero landings, or the readout artifact is proven absent — a fail-closed refusal | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `8` | the write itself failed — the outcome is **UNKNOWN** | — | — | — | — | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| `9` | the write landed but the read-back does not match | — | — | — | — | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| `10` | a supplied value is off the closed vocabulary — a bad `--polarity`, a `--sha` that is not a head SHA, an unparseable `--since`, a `--record` that is not a four-digit id, a `--path` outside this skill's own resolved directory | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `11` | a **precondition read failed** — nothing was written and the outcome is UNKNOWN | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `12` | refused: the `--sha` given is not the PR's head — a read taken over, or a verdict bound to, a tree that is no longer the PR | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| `13` | refused: the read completed but its scope is **provably incomplete** — a truncated changed-file list or diff, a comment enumeration short of its declared count. A local read short of GitHub's `changed_files` is **not** that proof anywhere in this group | ✓ | — | ✓ | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `14` | refused: this PR's diff derives **no** governance namespace — a verdict in a namespace the diff did not require | — | — | — | — | ✓ | — | — |
| `17` | refused: the write would retire a standing verdict of the **opposite polarity** at this head — ranged, over this range — and `--supersede` was not passed; nothing written | — | — | — | — | ✓ | — | — |
| `127` | the verb never ran (unresolved binary) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**The export names `governance/codes.ts` must ship**, because `checkAlignment`
(`packages/fabrika-cli/src/exit-code-alignment.ts`) keys on export *names* and not on numerals — a
different spelling reds the alignment test with nothing in the failure naming why:
`EMPTY_STDIN`, `DELIBERATE_GAP`, `LEAKED_PATH`, `BARE_AT_PATH`, `ZERO_SCOPE`, `WRITE_UNKNOWN`,
`READBACK_MISMATCH`, `OFF_VOCABULARY`, `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN`, `STALE_HEAD`, `INCOMPLETE_SCAN`,
`SUPERSEDES_VERDICT`, and this group's own `NOT_HARNESS_TOUCHING`.

**This matrix owns what a code *means*; the per-verb tables own what *triggers* it.** Every verb can
also return `0`, `1`, `126` and `127` with the meanings above, stated here and nowhere else; the
per-verb "Exit status" tables enumerate only that verb's own proven outcomes, `3` and up, phrased as
that verb's trigger.

**`11` is the shipped `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN`**, matched rather than reinvented: a read the verb
needed failed, so nothing is proven — not `7` (which is *proven* absence: a 404 is a fact about the
repository, an unreachable GitHub is not a fact about anything) and not `1` (which would fuse an
unreachable GitHub with a bad flag). **A corpus member that exists and could not be read is `11`,
never `7`** — an incomplete corpus is UNKNOWN, and answering `no-overlap` over it is the fail-open
this whole skill exists to prevent.

**`14` is this group's one private seat.** It is not `10`: `10` is a value off a closed vocabulary,
a caller typo. `14` is a *proven fact about the PR* — the diff was read, bound and partitioned, and
it derives no governance namespace. Folding them would make "you asked wrongly" and "this PR is not
mine to judge" one number, and only the second is safe to treat as a clean skip.
`review/codes.ts` seats its own `14` as `ACL_DENIED`; that is a different group's private band and
carries no cross-group uniqueness obligation (interface convention rule 3), so **declare `14`
locally and do not import it** — an implementer who imports `14` from `review` alongside `12` and
`13` gets the wrong meaning silently.

### The commit binding runs before every read

`governance scope`, `governance sweep`, `governance guards` and `governance base` serve the artifact
a governance verdict is formed over, so **the bytes come from a named commit, not from an endpoint
that takes a pull-request number and no commit at all.** A push landing between scoping and reading
otherwise serves the new head's artifact under the old head's SHA, and the result is a confident
verdict over text nobody judged. All four run one shared binding step
(`packages/fabrika-cli/src/governance/head.ts`, modelled on the shipped
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/head.ts` and importing `bindHead` from it) before any artifact read:

1. An explicit `--sha` must be **the PR's head**, or the verb refuses on `12`. Malformed is `10`.
   `governance base` takes no `--sha`: it binds against the live head and re-resolves it, and its
   `12` refuses when that head moved mid-resolve.
2. A configured git remote must serve the target repo, `pull/<pr>/head` must **fetch**, the commit
   must resolve in the object database, and `git rev-parse` must resolve it to *itself*. The base ref
   must resolve too, since a diff is a range, **and so must the merge base of that branch tip and
   this head** — the binding carries the tip and the branch point as two separate values, and every
   verb's `base` is the branch point. Any of these unmet is `11`, naming what is UNKNOWN.
   There is no permissive fallback to the PR-number endpoints.
3. The artifact is then read with `git diff <base>...<head>` and `git show <head>:<path>` under flags
   that pin output to the two commits rather than to the invoking user's own git configuration
   (`--no-ext-diff`, explicit `a/`/`b/` prefixes).

**`scope` and `base` in range mode run no PR binding, because there is no PR to bind.** The
caller has already named two commits, which is what the binding exists to produce, so the two ends
are read straight out of the object database and the base is `merge-base(base, tip)` — the same
commit git's three-dot form resolves for `<base>...<tip>`, so both modes derive over one range.
A range end that will not resolve is `11`, never a fallback to either end.

**The fetch is load-bearing, not incidental.** A stale working tree is what made four seats declare
a merged decision record nonexistent, and what applied a withdrawn one 86 minutes after its
withdrawal. v1's `adr-sweep.sh` has no fetch at all and reads whatever decision corpus the launching
checkout happens to hold. Nothing is checked out here: a fetch writes objects, not a working tree, so
the head's instruction files are never on disk to be loaded.

### Read-backs compare normalized text, not bytes

`governance post` and `governance readout` re-read their target and compare through
**`normalizeForReadback` from `packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/compose.ts`** — import it; its third
step (strip trailing newlines) is the one a re-derivation drops, and dropping it fires exit `9` on
clean runs.

### Machine-local path detection

`governance post` and `governance readout` share the leak predicate **already implemented** at
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/leaks.ts` — import it, never re-derive it. Follow the shipped
wrapper shape at `packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/authored.ts` and
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/triage/authored.ts`: a `readAuthored(surface, read)` plus a
`leakRefusal(...)`.

### Three shipped-surface changes this group requires

All are additive; none changes how any existing marker, namespace or verdict reads. Each is a
change to a surface this group does not own, so each names the file and the exact edit. **Changes 1,
1b and 2 have landed** — they are kept here, in landed state, because they are still the surfaces
this group's fail-closed property rests on. Change 3 is the only one still outstanding.

**1. `ship`'s required-namespace vocabulary must admit `governance` — without this the whole
fail-closed property is decoration. LANDED.**
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/classes.ts:161` now declares `SHIP_NAMESPACES` as the `review-*`
set derived from `SHIP_CLASS_NAMES` **plus** the literal `governance`, and `shipNamespacesOf`
(`packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/classes.ts:149`) appends `governance` when the PR's changed files
touch any of this group's governed roots — the same total function `governance scope` computes, so the
two cannot disagree. `packages/fabrika-cli/src/ship/gate-verb.ts:158` refuses any `--require` value
outside `SHIP_NAMESPACES` with `OFF_VOCABULARY`, so **`fabrika ship gate --require governance` is
admitted**: the skill's "fail-closed on absence" property — a claim about `ship gate`'s conjunction —
is enforced, not merely specified. Why it was required: until it landed, a harness-touching diff
could reach the enqueue seam with no governance verdict and nothing anywhere said no.

`ship gate`'s resolution of a `governance` marker needs no change beyond this: it reads markers
through the same `verdict-marker` format for every namespace, and the verdict marker's key already
carries no notion of which skill posted one. **This is not a second answer to an enforced
question** — the enqueue conjunction stays `ship gate`'s alone. It is that enforcer being taught
one more namespace, which is the only shape in which a derived-required namespace can actually be
required.

**1b. …and requiring it must not be optional. LANDED.** Admitting the namespace left one
hole: `--require` was caller-asserted, so a session that simply never passed
`--require governance` shipped a governance-root diff with no governance verdict, and the gate
called that `satisfied`. `packages/fabrika-cli/src/ship/gate-verb.ts` now reads the PR's own
changed-file list and raises the required set from it (`requiredWithFloor`) through the **same**
`touchesGovernanceRoot` predicate `governance scope` and `ship scope` use — one derivation, three
readers. So the requirement is a property of the diff, not of what a session remembered to type.

**1c. …and the requirement had to be readable by something other than an agent. LANDED.**
`ship gate` seats `blocked` at exit 0 and no workflow invoked it, so the floor bound on nothing but
prose in the `ship` skill and two fabrika-tree PRs merged with no governance verdict after it
shipped. `fabrika ship floor` reads the same conjunction for this one namespace and refuses on `18`
when the verdict is absent, stale or fail; the repo arms a `governance-floor` workflow that runs it
with `--publish-check`, which publishes that answer as the `governance floor at head` check-run —
pending while no verdict exists, red once one exists and is wrong. The mechanism choice and
why the alternatives were rejected are recorded once, in
[the `ship` contract](../ship/contract.md#the-mechanism-choice); the conclusion map is
[its check-run section](../ship/contract.md#publish-check).

**The founder ruled this instead of a §CP row** (2026-08-10): the plugin tree gets **no** CODEOWNERS
row and **no** §CP-boundary widening. The model
is *machine gate plus human awareness, not a human click* — this floor blocks the enqueue, and the
§CP digest readout (producer: this skill; display: the front door) carries every plugin-tree
landing to the founder. **Visibility after landing replaces blocking before it**, with the limit
recorded rather than glossed: the readout makes a gate-weakening landing *visible*, not
*impossible*, and the machine chain has already missed one. `.github/**` — CODEOWNERS included — and
everything the existing §CP boundary already covers stay §CP, enforced server-side regardless.

**2. The `verdict-marker` namespace class must admit `governance`. LANDED, with one
residual.** `packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/verdict-marker.ts` now declares
`const NAMESPACE = /^(review|check-epic-plan|governance)(-[a-z0-9]+)*$/` (`:73`) and
`const NAMESPACE_PREFIXES = ["review", "check-epic-plan", "governance"]` (`:78`), so a `governance`
marker **is** representable — `read`'s prefix gate admits it and the regex accepts it, instead of
turning it away as `Absent` before the regex is tested and letting `emit` compose bytes the format
can never read back. Both constants widened together, the same additive shape the plan gate's own
widening used; widening one and not the other would have been the defect. **The residual:** the
registry's `verdict-marker` row (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/registry.ts:68`) still carries only
`review-code` round-trip and malformed fixtures, so `wire/conformance.ts` drives no `governance`
arm — adding those fixture rows is what remains of this change.

**3. A new registered format `governance-digest`.** One row in
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/registry.ts` plus a sibling schema module
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/governance-digest.ts` — never a branch inside a verb, which is that
registry's stated law. Producer `governance`, consumer the front door. The artifact is a fenced
block under a
`## Governance readout` heading whose rows are the **stdin row grammar `governance readout` accepts**
— `row\t<NNNN>\t<tension|blast|routine>\t<one-line note>` — and **not** that verb's own stdout line,
which reports the write rather than carrying the digest. `emit` / `read` / fixtures / brands as the
registry's `WireFormat` requires.

**The artifact's bytes, in full, because an implementer writes `emit` and `read` against these and
nothing else in this spec shows them:**

````markdown
## Governance readout

```governance-digest
row	0398	tension	sits against ADR 0173 on whether a pending required check blocks admission
row	0401	blast	every cache key in the system gains a tenant component
row	0396	routine	no tension found
```
````

`emit` composes exactly that block from the rows; `read` is total over any artifact — `Found` with
the rows in file order, `Absent` when no `## Governance readout` heading with a `governance-digest`
fence is present, and `Malformed` when the heading and fence are present but a line is not a
conforming `row` (a drifted heading level, a fourth field, an off-vocabulary kind, a non-four-digit
id). The round-trip fixture is the three rows above; the malformed fixtures are, at minimum, a
drifted heading level, a fence holding prose instead of rows, and a row whose kind is off the closed
set. The note is the only free-text field and it never carries a directive — a receiver re-fetches
the record the id names and reads it there. The digest is a
**closed-vocabulary** artifact for exactly the AC-5 reason: the front door re-fetches and re-reads it
rather than trusting anything a coordination message carried.

## `governance scope`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika governance scope 4321 [--sha <head>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
fabrika governance scope --base <rev> --tip <rev> [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | in PR mode | — | the pull-request number to scope; dropped in range mode, which names its own subject |
| `--sha` | string | no | the PR's live head | the head to read the changed files at; see the binding step above. Refused beside a range |
| `--base` | string | with `--tip` | — | the range's base end, 7–40 lowercase hex — the epic-child form |
| `--tip` | string | with `--base` | — | the range's tip end |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository. Not read in range mode, which resolves no PR |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**The two modes name a subject two ways and derive identically.** A PR's subject is its bound head
against its merge base; a range's is `<base>...<tip>`, whose base end is `merge-base(base, tip)` —
the same commit git's own three-dot form resolves, and the one `governance base` then serves this
skill's bytes at. Range mode reads no PR at all: an epic run opens one tail PR at the end rather
than one per child, so mid-run a child has none.

**Output** — machine channel. First line:
`governance\t<required|not-required>\t<head-sha|base..tip>` — the third field names the subject the
derivation ran over: the commit the file list was read out of in PR mode, the range in range mode,
matching `governance post`'s third field in each. Then one line per harness root the diff touches,
most-touched first — `root\t<governed-root>\t<file-count>` — then
`self\t<true|false>`, then one line per decision record in the diff —
`record\t<NNNN>\t<added|modified|deleted>\t<path>`.

With `--json`, an object with keys `outcome` (`required` | `not-required`), `head` (full 40-hex, or
`<base>..<tip>` in range mode — the same field the first line's third column carries),
`roots` (an object mapping each touched root to its file count, count-descending and ties on the
root — evidence no caller reads row by row is capped and counted rather than listed whole, and the
skill reads the root set off `fabrika status settings`, never off this field),
`self` (boolean), `base` (the merge-base SHA, full 40-hex),
`records` (array of `{id, change, path}`), and `scanned` (changed files seen).

`deleted` is in the change vocabulary because removing a decision record is itself a governance
event — the one change to the corpus an `added`/`modified` pair cannot express at all.

**The root set is a path prefix list the repo declares — `governedRoots` in `.fabrika.jsonc` — and a
repo that declares nothing gets the shipped default, whose four entries are the kinds below. A
repo that keeps governed text anywhere else, such as a plugin tree of its own, declares that root.
Read the resolved list off `fabrika status settings`, never off this table:**

| Root | Why it is governance-bearing |
|---|---|
| the decision corpus (`decisionsDir`) | the records themselves — commonly outside CODEOWNERS, so this is the guard that stays |
| `.claude/` | agent and skill definitions the harness executes |
| `.github/` | workflows, CODEOWNERS and rulesets — the enforcement layer |
| `.fabrika.jsonc` | the config that declares this very list, plus every other gate's scope |

**Two declarations are refused rather than honoured, and both at load.** An empty list would read as
"nothing is governed", silently disabling the gate it drives; a list that does not cover
`.fabrika.jsonc` would let a config un-govern itself, the one change nobody would ever be asked to
justify. Either way `governance scope` refuses `11` — the root set is UNKNOWN, never `not-required`.
`review scope` derives its `governance` line off the same key, so the two verbs answer one question
once.

`required` iff at least one changed path is under at least one root. **The directory is the unit of
coverage, not the file type** — the v1 §CP definition learned this the hard way: an enumerated
skill-dir list plus an any-depth `*.sh` clause left a non-`.sh` file beside a gated script
proven-ordinary and auto-mergeable at zero approvals. `self` is true when any changed path is under the
resolved skill root — the same `*/fabrika/skills/governance/SKILL.md` resolution `governance base`
states below, plugin segment included, **never hardcoded to one repo's install path**. The
shipped roots do not cover that directory, so this skill's own diff derives its own namespace only
in a repo that carries the plugin in its tree and declares that tree as a root.

**This is not the §CP answer and the verb says so on stderr**, once, on every run:
`governance scope: this is the governance-namespace derivation, not a §CP classification — §CP is CODEOWNERS' answer.`

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404), or closed, or declares **zero changed files**; or the local three-dot read changes no path; or the range changes no path — a derivation over nothing, refused fail-closed |
| `10` | `--sha` is not a head SHA; a lone `--base`/`--tip`; `--sha` beside a range; a range end that is not a revision; a positional beside a range, or neither a positional nor a range |
| `11` | the PR could not be read, the commit could not be bound, or the range's merge base or file list could not be read — the derivation is UNKNOWN, never `not-required` |
| `12` | `--sha` is not the PR's head — re-scope at the head |
| `13` | the range's changed-file enumeration is provably short against a **second read of the same range** — the range mode's `--name-status` walk under its `--name-only` count. GitHub's `changed_files` is not that second read and no longer refuses here |

| `governance scope: partitioned <local> of the <declared> declared changed files at <subject> across <roots> roots.` | 0 | notice |

**Scope** — one PR's metadata and the local three-dot changed-file list of one bound commit; or one
range's changed-file list, count-checked against a second, independent enumeration of the same
range. **On the PR path the local list IS the file set.** GitHub's `changed_files` is computed
against a base it cached at the last push and pairs a rename as two files where git reports one, so a
disagreement with it is printed as a notice and never refused on. Nothing on the reviewer's side can
invalidate that cache, so refusing there stranded the round with no act available to clear it. The
`partitioned` notice prints both counts, and on a disagreement they differ by design — the first is
the set the derivation ran over, the second is what the platform declares.

Zero changed files is a refusal in either mode, never `not-required`. The whole value of a
`not-required` answer is that it was computed over everything. On the PR path the local read is
checked for that too, not only the PR's declared count.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika governance scope 4321

```

**Grounding**

- §CP-by-content has no platform enforcement, and only §CP-by-path hard-gates. This
  verb does not try to fill that gap with a content regex; it derives a *separate* namespace whose
  verdict is the skill's judgment, and leaves §CP to CODEOWNERS.
- The v1 §CP boundary's recorded holes — the enumerated skill-dir list, the `**/*.sh` clause, the
  `.claude-plugin/` hyphen miss — are why the root set is a list of directory prefixes and not a file-type
  or an enumeration that can rot as surfaces are added.
- v1's `class-probe` read 0 files and classified `has-code` at exit 0; the zero-file case
  here is a `7` refusal.
- The file list is the derivation's only input, so the list and the head are one commit or
  the verb refuses.
- `class-probe`'s `ReviewNamespace` is a closed three-value union keyed to v1's gate skills, so a new
  required namespace there is a type-level change. Here the requirement is a boolean over a root
  list, so a fifth root is a one-row edit with no type surgery.

## `governance sweep`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika governance sweep 4321 --record 0240 [--sha <head>] [--dir <path>] [--limit <n>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
fabrika governance sweep --landed 0240 [--dir <path>] [--limit <n>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | no | — | the pull-request number the subject record lives in; required unless `--landed` is given |
| `--record` | string | no | — | the four-digit id of the decision record in that PR to sweep; required with the positional |
| `--landed` | string | no | — | sweep a record already in `--dir` instead of one in a PR — the digest-time mode; mutually exclusive with the positional and `--record` |
| `--sha` | string | no | the PR's live head | the head to read the subject record at; see the binding step above |
| `--dir` | string | no | `.decisions` | the corpus to rank against |
| `--limit` | integer | no | `8` | the maximum shortlist entries |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the answer as JSON on stdout instead of the line grammar |

**Output** — machine channel. First line is the outcome token —
`shortlist` · `no-overlap` · `indeterminate` — and on `shortlist`, one line per entry:
`<id>\t<score to 2dp>\t<file>\t<title>`.

With `--json`:
`{"outcome":…,"subject":"0240","entries":[{"id","score","file","title"}…],"reason":null|"…","scanned":<n>,"inScope":<n>,"cited":<n>}`.

<a id="sweep-all-three-are-answers"></a>
**All three outcomes exit 0 and all three are answers.** `no-overlap` is a distinct token, never an
empty shortlist, and **none of the three is a clearance** — a record that disagrees with the subject
about what a *label means* shares no distinctive vocabulary and never appears here at all. The
`reason` field carries that sentence verbatim on the `no-overlap` arm so a caller reading only the
JSON cannot mistake it for one.

`indeterminate` fires when the live-`accepted` corpus is below `RARITY_FLOOR` (10) — rarity is not
measurable and every term scores as common — or when the subject yields no distinctive terms. The
stderr reason names which of the two.

**The ranking core is imported, not restated.** `decisionBearingText`, `tokenize`, the idf scoring,
`RARITY_FLOOR` and `DEFAULT_LIMIT` come from `packages/fabrika-cli/src/adr/sweep.ts`. This verb owns
only the subject acquisition: `git show <bound-head>:<path>` for the PR mode, a corpus read for
`--landed`. Two runs of the two verbs over the same bytes therefore produce the same ranking by
construction rather than by agreement.

**Every score this spec prints is derivable from that module** — score is the sum over shared terms
of `log(n / max(df, 1))`, where `n` is the live-`accepted` count and `df` the document frequency,
counted only for terms with `df < n`. The example below is illustrative of the *shape*; an
implementer reproduces scores from the imported module, never from this document.

**Exit status**

| `11` | the subject record could not be read at the bound commit, the commit could not be bound, **or a corpus member exists and could not be read** — an incomplete corpus is UNKNOWN |
| `12` | `--sha` is not the PR's head |

| `governance sweep: only <k> live-accepted records in <dir> (rarity needs at least 10) — the run carries no information.` | 0 | notice |

**Scope** — the live-`accepted` records in `--dir`, minus those the subject already cites. On the PR
path the file set proving `--record` is in this PR is the local three-dot read, shared with
`governance scope` and `governance guards`; GitHub's `changed_files` is reported beside it and
never refused on. The scope line names the corpus size and the in-scope count on stderr, because
the outcome is only readable against them. Zero records is a refusal; a corpus below the rarity
floor is `indeterminate` at exit 0, which is a different fact and stays a different answer.

indeterminate
$ echo $?
0
```

**Grounding**

- v1's `adr-sweep.sh` **exits non-zero on its own informative case** — a shortlist, the normal
  outcome of a healthy sweep, reads as a failed run to any caller keying on status — and its
  exit `1` is shared by shortlist, indeterminate and the CLI's own failure, while a `kp_pcli`
  failure exits `127` that its skill prose never mentions. All three outcomes exit `0` here and
  every failure has its own seat.
- v1's `--json` **lands on stderr on the shortlist path** and on stdout only for the useless clean
  report, because the report is routed through a `CheckFailed`. Here `--json` is on stdout
  for all three outcomes.
- v1's sweep never fetches; it reads whatever decision corpus the launching checkout holds. The
  subject here is read at a bound commit and the corpus read is count-reported.
- The citation-independence rule is v1's one good idea, kept: the candidate set is never derived
  from the subject's own reference list, because a document that never names what it contradicts
  gives you no thread to pull.
- A spec that prints a score it cannot derive is incomplete; the derivation is stated above
  and the module that owns it is named.

## `governance guards`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika governance guards 4321 [--sha <head>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--sha` | string | no | the PR's live head | the head to read the diff at; see the binding step above |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. First line:
`guards\t<hits|no-anchor-change|no-anchors-in-reach>\t<anchors-in-reach>` — the third field is how
many anchored invariants exist in the files this diff touches. Then one line per hit:
`anchor\t<removed|modified>\t<NAME>\t<file>:<line>`, and one line per touched guard-bearing file
with no anchor change: `guard-file\t<path>\t<anchor-count>`, capped at **five** and followed by
`guard-file-more\t<n>` when the cap dropped any.

With `--json`:
`{"outcome":…,"hits":[{"kind","name","file","line"}…],"guardFiles":{"rows":[{"path","anchors"}…],"more":<n>},"inReach":<n>,"scanned":<files>}`.

**`hits` is whole; `guardFiles` is capped.** Every anchored hit needs a disposition, so that array is
the answer. The guard-bearing file list is evidence — this skill cites that it exists and never reads
a row by name — so it collapses to a cap-and-count, the bounded shape every evidence field in this
group takes. `more` is always present, `0`
included: a whole list must never read as a truncated one.

**The three outcomes are distinct facts and none is a clearance.** `hits` — an anchored invariant
was removed or its claim changed. `no-anchor-change` — anchors exist in the diff's reach and none
moved. `no-anchors-in-reach` — the touched files carry no anchors at all, so this scan had nothing
to look at; it is the mechanical floor reporting its own silence, not a statement that no guard was
weakened. It always names a file set that was read: a scan whose file set is empty refuses at `7`
instead of taking this outcome. A guard weakened in prose that carries no anchor is invisible here **by construction**,
and the skill's judgment is what covers it.

**What an anchor is.** The `<!-- anchor: NAME -->` HTML comment fabrika skills already carry; NAME is
`[A-Z][A-Z0-9-]*`. A tag inside backticks is documentation of the pattern, not an anchor.

**What is compared is the anchor's whole block, at both commits.** An anchor's block is the text
trailing its tag plus the lines that continue the same paragraph, ending at a blank line, a heading,
a new list item, a code fence, or the next anchor. Each changed file is read at the base commit and
at the head, and the blocks are paired by NAME and occurrence: a NAME absent from the head is
`removed`; a NAME whose block text differs is `modified`. Whitespace is collapsed before comparing,
so a re-wrap or a move is not a hit. Reading both commits is what makes the answer independent of
the diff's shape — a same-line comparison could not see an anchor whose own line was never in the
diff, so a paragraph reworded under an untouched tag once read as `no-anchor-change`. A deleted
file and a rename have no
comparable base path, so those keep the older same-line walk over the diff's `+`/`-` lines; a file
covered by both scans still reports one hit per NAME.

Two rules complete that definition, both load-bearing, so that two implementers build one verb.

**A block continues past its own line only from a tag that opens that line.** Indentation, a
blockquote marker, one list bullet, or a block comment's decoration may precede the tag — nothing
else. A tag reached after real content gets only the text trailing it on that line, which is what the
same-line walk has always compared. This is what stops a tag written inside a string literal from
swallowing the code below it, and it is a fence on the widening, never a narrowing.

**Inside a block comment, a line's prose is the line minus its decoration, and the comment's end ends
the block.** Half the guarded corpus writes its claims in TypeScript docblocks, where every
continuation line opens with a star — the same bytes as a markdown list item, and only the frame
tells the two apart. Without this rule every `.ts` block stopped on the line after its tag, so those
anchors counted toward `anchors-in-reach` while being unable to produce a hit. A real list *inside* a
docblock still ends the block, because the break is tested against the prose, not the decoration.

**What a guard-bearing file is, stated closed so two implementers build one verb.** A changed file is
guard-bearing iff it satisfies at least one of exactly two clauses: **(a)** it contains at least one
anchor at the bound commit, or **(b)** it is under `.github/workflows/`. Nothing else qualifies — in
particular, "a file that looks important" is not a criterion, and the verb does not read file content
beyond the anchor scan.

**A CODEOWNERS-ownership clause was considered and deliberately dropped.** It would have read
`.github/CODEOWNERS` to decide whether to print a row, which (i) makes this verb depend on a file
nothing else here needs, and (ii) is not closed — "a control-plane team row" has no mechanical
definition without naming a team handle, so two implementers would build two verbs. Both remaining
clauses are fully mechanical over the diff and the bound tree. This verb reads no CODEOWNERS.

**Why the inventory is not in this verb.** v1's gate-invariant check kept a hardcoded prose list of
what each gate promises, inside the reviewing skill — a copy of the guarded files, which drifts from
them silently and which nothing checks. Anchors live in the guarded file itself, so the set cannot
rot while the guards move. That is the whole design difference, and it is why this verb reports
anchors rather than invariants.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404) or closed; or it declares zero changed files; or the local three-dot read — the set actually scanned — changes no path |

| `13` | the served diff body is provably incomplete — fewer files than git's own `--name-status` enumeration of the same range reports; a partial scan must never print beside a "nothing moved" answer. GitHub's declared count is not that proof and no longer refuses here |

**Scope** — the bound commit's diff, completeness-checked against **git's own `--name-status`
enumeration of the same range**, and the anchors in every file that diff touches, read at the base
commit as well as at the head. A truncated diff is refused rather than scanned, because an
under-reported hit list reads as a checked-clean answer that was never checked; a file that cannot be
read at either commit is refused for the same reason. The completeness proof is git against git:
GitHub's `changed_files` is a different merge base and a different rename detection, so a
disagreement with it is a notice here rather than a refusal. **A local read of zero files is still a
refusal**, on the `7` seat, and it is the floor the third outcome needs: `anchors-in-reach` counts
only over files that were read, so an empty set would print `no-anchors-in-reach` at exit 0 — a scan
of nothing reading as a clean answer. The PR's own declared zero refuses one step earlier, and this
catches the zero that count no longer sees.

```
$ fabrika governance guards 4321

```

**Grounding**

- v1 `review-skill` Step 4 check 4 — "does the edit quietly weaken a gate?", the most serious verdict
  that gate lands, whose evidence form is the exact removed or softened line and the invariant it
  breaks. That judgment moves here whole; only its hardcoded invariant inventory is left behind.
- The worked v1 FAIL is the shape this scan is calibrated on: a diff dropping the `@ <sha>` from the
  shipper's matcher, so the SHA-staleness refusal no longer fires.
- v1's explicitly-empty answer is kept and made mechanical: a non-gate-critical PR records "no gate
  invariant is in the diff's reach" as a PASS with that evidence. `no-anchors-in-reach` is that
  answer's machine half — an explicitly-empty answer rather than an unwritten one.
- A PR once shipped an invariant-narrowing change in skill text with no authorizing decision
  record, and the record the reviewer required was never filed. The hit list is what makes that
  finding concrete enough to survive an agreement that nobody wrote down.
- The scan states its scope (`inReach`) on its own channel, so "I scanned nothing and
  found nothing" is never renderable as a pass.

| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository. Not read in range mode, which resolves no PR |

**In range mode the merge base is `merge-base(base, tip)`** — the same commit the range's own
three-dot diff is taken from, and the one `governance scope --base/--tip` reports as its `base`. This
verb takes no `--sha` in either mode, so there is none to refuse beside a range. There is no
staleness check on the range path and none is missing: a PR's head is a moving name this verb has to
re-read, where a range's two ends are revisions the caller already fixed.

**Output** — machine channel. First line: `base\t<merge-base-sha>\t<file-count>`. Then, per path, a
header line `file\t<path>\t<byte-count>` followed by that file's bytes at the merge-base. No
`--json`: the bytes are the object.

**This verb exists so the self fence is a pasteable literal.** The skill's rule — judge a
self-editing PR by the merge-base revision of its own text — needs a merge-base SHA the model would
otherwise have to compute and interpolate, which the harness's isolation verifier refuses (interface
convention rule 5: every documented invocation is a plain literal command string). Resolving a merge
base and reading named paths at it is mechanical; judging by them is not.

**`--path` is fenced to this skill's own directory, and that directory is resolved, not hardcoded.**

*Resolution, stated as an algorithm because two implementers must produce one verb.* At the bound
merge-base, list the tracked paths matching `*/fabrika/skills/governance/SKILL.md` — the plugin
segment is part of the pattern, deliberately, because a bare `*/skills/governance/` also matches a
repo-root `skills/` tree or a symlinked v1 tree and would serve the wrong bytes as "this skill's own
text". The **skill root** is that file's parent directory.

- **Exactly one match** — that is the root; `--path` is admitted iff it lies under it.
- **Zero matches** — refuse on `7`. There is no self fence to run, and falling back to a guessed
  root is how a fence reads the wrong file while reporting success.
- **More than one match** — refuse on `11`, naming every candidate. Which install is "this skill" is
  genuinely unknown, and picking one is a coin flip the caller cannot see.

**Do not hardcode one repo's path.** This skill ships to other repositories, and a literal
`claude-plugins/fabrika/` fence refuses the self fence in every one of them — a failure a graded run
of this spec surfaced. The fence itself is deliberate: this verb exists for the self fence, and a
general "read any file at the merge-base" verb would be a second way to load instructions out of a
tree, which is what the whole no-checkout posture exists to prevent. Nothing is checked out here
either; the bytes come from the object database.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404) or closed; or the skill root resolved to **zero** matches; or every `--path` is proven absent at the merge-base — a self fence over no bytes |
| `10` | a `--path` resolves outside the resolved skill root (see the resolution above); a lone `--base`/`--tip`; a range end that is not a revision; a positional beside a range, or neither a positional nor a range |
| `11` | the merge base could not be resolved, a path could not be read at it, or the skill root resolved to **more than one** candidate — the base rules are UNKNOWN, so no fallback to the head or the tip is taken |
| `12` | the PR's head moved while the base was being resolved — re-run; a base paired with a head nobody judged is not a fence |

**Scope** — one merge base, the resolved skill root, and the named paths at it. The resolution's
scope line names the root it found, on stderr. **Zero scope is a refusal in both directions**: zero
resolved roots is `7` and more than one is `11`, and zero readable paths is `7` — a self fence that
reads nothing would silently fall back to judging by the head's rules, which is the exact failure
the fence exists to prevent.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika governance base 4321 --path claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/governance/SKILL.md
base	8b1e0c4499ad72f635e0117a9bb2d3c058e7fa16	1
file	claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/governance/SKILL.md	39
---
name: governance
---

# governance
```

The `file` header's third field is the byte count that follows it, so a reader knows exactly where
one file's bytes end and the next `file` header begins; with the default two paths, two `file`
blocks follow the `base` line back to back, in the order the paths were resolved. There is no
separator line — the byte count is the delimiter.

```
$ fabrika governance base 4321 --path claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/review/SKILL.md
governance base: --path "claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/review/SKILL.md" is outside this skill's own directory (claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/governance/) — this verb reads only this skill's own text.
$ echo $?
10
```

**Grounding**

- **The base-revision pin**: a gate must not review a PR by the instructions that PR
  introduces. v1 enforced it with a denylist that removed the head's instruction surfaces from a
  worktree; here nothing is checked out at all, so there is no surface to remove and the fence is
  a positive read of named base bytes instead of a negative scrub.
- The `11` refusal never falls back to the head. A self fence that degrades to the head's rules on a
  failed read is a fence that opens exactly when it is being tested.

## `governance post`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika governance post 4321 --polarity PASS --sha 03135b91 --clause "no contradiction, no weakening" [--supersede] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

The verdict body arrives on **stdin only** — no `--body`, no `--body-file`, for the reason the
sibling write verbs give: a path flag is how a machine-local path reaches a public surface while the
poster reads success.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--polarity` | enum | yes | — | `PASS` or `FAIL` — a third token is not a polarity |
| `--sha` | string | yes | — | the head the reviewer actually inspected (7–40 lowercase hex) |
| `--clause` | string | yes | — | the human clause; blank is not a clause |
| `--supersede` | boolean | no | `false` | acknowledge that this verdict retires a standing one of the **opposite** polarity at this head — ranged, over this range; without it that post is the `17` refusal |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |
| stdin | markdown | yes | — | the verdict body below the first line: the questions swept, the sweep outcome, the domain read by hand, the anchored invariants in reach and their disposition |

**Output** — machine channel. One line:
`posted\tgovernance\t<polarity>\t<sha>\t<content>\t<created|superseded>\t<comment-url>`, where
`<content>` is the content digest the verdict binds, and the sixth field says whether the
write opened a fresh comment or appended into this namespace's existing comment at this head,
retiring the verdict that was there.
With `--json`:
`{"outcome":"posted","namespace":"governance","polarity":…,"sha":…,"content":…,"upsert":"created"|"superseded","floor":"refired"|"restarting"|"green"|"in-flight"|"no-run"|"no-floor"|"unknown","commentUrl":…}`.
The tab line does not carry `floor` — the floor's outcome is on stderr, one line, always.

**The namespace is fixed.** There is no `--namespace` flag: this verb emits exactly one namespace and
composing another is not a mode it has. That is the disjointness guarantee made structural in the
other direction from `review post`, which refuses a namespace outside its derived set — here the
namespace is a constant, so it cannot be aimed anywhere else even by a confused caller.

**The range-scoped form.** With `--base` and `--tip` the verdict is scoped to a range instead of a
head — the epic-child form. The positional then names the child issue, and the requirement is
re-derived over what `<base>...<tip>` changed in this checkout. The first line is composed through
the `range-verdict-marker` format that `lane prove` reads, and the answer's fourth field is
`<base>..<tip>` where the pull-request form carries the sha. The write appends exactly as step 5
below describes, keyed on the range rather than a head. `--sha` is refused beside a range, and so is
a lone `--base` or `--tip` (`10`); an issue that is absent, closed or a pull request is `7`.

**What the operation does, in order — each step gates the next.**

1. **Re-resolve the live head.** `--sha` not prefix-matching it is the `12` refusal: a verdict formed
   over a moved-past tree is re-reviewed, never re-bound.
2. **Re-derive the namespace requirement at the bound commit** — the same derivation
   `governance scope` prints, through the shared binding step. A PR that derives `not-required` is
   the `14` refusal. This is the fail-closed condition inverted at the write seam: the namespace
   cannot be filled on a diff that did not require it, so a governance PASS always attests a diff
   that was actually in scope.
3. **Compose the first line through the wire format's `emit`**
   (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/verdict-marker.ts`, imported — fields
   `namespace`/`polarity`/`sha`/`content`/`clause`), giving
   `governance: PASS @ <sha> content:<digest> — <clause>`. The digest is taken over the same bound
   range this step's derivation read, so a verdict survives a branch update that leaves the diff and
   every changed file byte-identical, and dies on anything else. This requires the namespace
   widening specified above; until it lands, `emit` composes bytes `read` rejects and step 6 fails
   every clean run.
4. **Leak-scan the assembled comment** (`report/leaks.ts`, imported) — an authored machine-local path
   is the `5` refusal, a bare `@` reference the `6`.
5. **Append into one comment per head.** An existing comment by this bot whose first non-blank line
   reads as the `governance` namespace **bound to the head being posted** — its marker `sha` compared
   prefix-tolerantly to that head — receives the fresh verdict on its first line with its prior
   verdict retired verbatim below the `<!-- fabrika:superseded -->` fence, under a dated
   `## Superseded verdict — YYYY-MM-DD` heading; otherwise a new comment is created. **The prior
   verdict is never replaced.** GitHub keeps no comment-body history, so a PATCH over a verdict is
   that verdict gone: a FAIL replaced by a PASS at one head leaves no trace a gate ever blocked. The
   fresh verdict goes on top because the marker is the comment's first non-blank
   line, so every reader — `ship gate`, `review verdicts`, `lane prove` — resolves the newest one
   without knowing the envelope exists. When the write would retire a standing verdict of the
   **opposite** polarity at this head, the post is the `17` refusal unless `--supersede` is passed,
   and nothing is written on that refusal — the flip is legitimate and routine, but it is the one
   that decides the merge, so it is said out loud. A post at a moved head still creates a second
   comment, leaving the prior head's verdict readable: a verdict is SHA-bound, so a new head's
   verdict is a different fact, not a revision, and editing the old comment destroys the only record
   of what was true over that tree. One namespace at one head, one comment: a second marker stacked
   on line 2 is un-anchored, resolves the namespace empty and fail-closes a substantively-passing PR.
6. **Read it back, unconditionally, from live PR state** — re-fetch the comment, hand its body to the
   format's `read`, require `Found` with exactly the five fields posted, then compare the whole
   comment against the bytes sent through `normalizeForReadback`. The comparand is the **envelope**,
   not the fresh verdict alone: on a re-post the bytes sent carry the retired verdict below the
   fence, so comparing the fresh half would red every append. A read-back that trusts a carried
   variable instead of live state re-ships the false PASS a hand-rolled emit once self-reported.
7. **Assert the floor at this head.** The repo's `governance-floor` workflow triggers on
   `pull_request` alone, so it ran before this verdict could exist, judged a head with no verdict on
   it, and no comment write can re-fire a `pull_request`-triggered job — every governance-root PR
   carries an unsatisfied floor at least once and carries it until something re-runs the job. The
   verb reads the runs at the bound head, and when the newest `governance-floor` run there is
   completed it asks the `governance floor at head` check-run whether the floor still needs
   clearing — pending or red, both do; the job's own conclusion decides only where no such check-run
   exists, because the job succeeds whenever it *published* an answer. Where it does, it requests a
   re-run of the whole run — `rerun-failed-jobs` is refused on a run with no failed job, which is now
   the ordinary shape — then re-reads the run and requires the re-fire to be **proven from run
   state** — either `run_attempt` increased, or that same run id is no longer `completed`, which only
   this dispatch could have caused. The counter lags the dispatch by a beat, and calling that beat
   unproven is what sent three agents chasing a `heal-ci` pass over re-fires that had taken.
   **The re-run is a re-derivation, never a claim**: nothing here writes a check-run or a status, so
   the green a PR ends with is one `ship floor` reached itself against live comment state. **This
   step is the one place the verb needs `actions: write`** on its token; no earlier step asks for it.
   Without it the re-run request 403s, the floor reads `unknown`, and the fix degrades to that same
   symptom — a red check a human clears — never to a false green.

**The floor assertion never changes the exit code.** By step 7 the verdict is landed and read back, so
a floor that could not be asserted is a red check, not an unwritten verdict — every outcome is one
stderr line and the `--json` `floor` field. The seven: `refired` (a new attempt exists), `restarting`
(the re-fired run is queued or running again under its own id with the new attempt number not yet
published — wait and re-read that run, never escalate it), `green` (the run at this head already
passed), `in-flight` (the run had not completed, so it may still judge state older than this verdict
— re-read the check), `no-run` (the runs listed at this head carry no `governance-floor` one, and
the repository does carry that workflow), `no-floor` (the repository's complete workflow inventory
holds no active `governance-floor` workflow, so it runs no floor and nothing needs re-firing),
`unknown` (the state could not be read or the re-fire could not be proven — never read as
a pass).

**`no-floor` is read only when the head lists no floor run, and only from a complete inventory.**
The verb then reads `GET /repos/{o}/{r}/actions/workflows` and matches each active workflow's `name`
against `governance-floor`. A failed read, or one that received fewer workflows than the envelope
declares, is `unknown` — never `no-floor`, because a read that did not see every workflow cannot
say one is absent. So is an inventory holding an entry that is not a record or carries no string
`name` or `state`: that entry could be the floor workflow, so its absence is unproven. The line
states the absence as a fact and asks the caller to re-read nothing.

**`no-run`'s line states the read and offers no cause.** The tag is one token, and what the verb
observed is that this head's run list carried no `governance-floor` entry — never why. The head's own
run count rides the line because it says how much was read: a head carrying other runs narrows the
empty filter to that one list, and a head carrying **no run at all** narrows nothing, since that is
also the answer the platform gives while it has not indexed the head's runs yet. Both arms end by
sending the reader back to re-read rather than treating the floor as absent. Concluding a cause here
has been wrong twice over: the line once offered "not installed" over a repository whose floor had
run at that head minutes before, and the head that incident was filed from listed 31 runs, so
"the floor did not fire for this head" would have been false there too.

**No advisory carrier.** `review post` takes `--carrier advisory` for §CP PRs, where a human approval
is the gate. This verb has no such mode: §CP is not this namespace's question, the governance verdict
is never the §CP approval, and a carrier flag here would be a second §CP answer wearing an input's
clothes.

**Scope** — one PR: its live head, the bound commit's file list for the re-derivation, its comments,
and the caller's stdin, plus two reads for step 7: the workflow runs at the bound head, and, when
those list no floor run, the repository's workflow inventory (`actions/workflows`). A read failing at
any of the first four is `11` — nothing written, outcome known-unwritten; a failed run-list read or a
failed inventory read is the `unknown` floor, because by then the verdict is written.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika governance post 4321 --polarity PASS --sha 03135b91 --clause "no contradiction, no weakening" < verdict.md
posted	governance	PASS	03135b91	2f1a9c4e0b7d	created	https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/4321#issuecomment-5154902211
```

```
$ fabrika governance post 4321 --polarity PASS --sha 03135b91 --clause "no contradiction, no weakening" --json < verdict.md

```

```
$ fabrika governance post 4 --polarity PASS --sha 9f2c1a77 --clause "ok" < verdict.md
governance post: #4's diff touches no governance root (docs/decisions/, .claude/, .github/, claude-plugins/, .fabrika.jsonc) — the namespace is not required here, and a verdict in it would attest a scope nobody derived.
$ echo $?
14
```

The re-post that retires a standing verdict of the same polarity needs no operand, and its sixth
field says the prior one was archived rather than replaced:

```
$ fabrika governance post 4321 --polarity PASS --sha 03135b91 --clause "no contradiction, no weakening" < verdict.md
posted	governance	PASS	03135b91	2f1a9c4e0b7d	superseded	https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/4321#issuecomment-5154902211
```

The flip is the one that has to be said out loud:

```
$ fabrika governance post 4321 --polarity PASS --sha 03135b91 --clause "no contradiction, no weakening" < verdict.md
governance post: a standing FAIL for governance at 03135b91 would be superseded by this PASS — pass --supersede to retire it on the record. Nothing was posted.
$ echo $?
17
```

**Grounding**

- The marker is SHA-bound and one-per-(PR, namespace), and that uniqueness rule leaves its head
  dimension open. Step 5 above closes it: the key is (PR, namespace, head), so a re-post
  at the same head lands in the one comment and a moved head opens a second. Which skill posted a
  namespace is still no part
  of the key — nothing in the enqueue decision asks — which is what makes one skill emitting N
  namespaces, and a namespace filled by a non-primary reviewer, both already legal.
- Within one comment, a re-post appends rather than replaces: the prior verdict is
  retired verbatim below the fence, because GitHub keeps no comment-body history to recover it from.
- A hand-rolled emit once posted a literal path and self-reported a false PASS; this verb is the
  single sanctioned path and the read-back is unconditional and from live state.
- Authority arrives through the ACL-checked read, never from the text being plausible.
  The verdict body is authored by this run, so `5`/`6` apply to it: authored text is refusable
  because the author can fix it.
- The `14` refusal is the fail-closed condition's write-seam half. Absence of a verdict on a
  required diff is a refusal downstream; presence of one on a non-required diff is a refusal here.
  Both directions exist so the namespace means exactly one thing.

## `governance digest`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika governance digest --since 2026-08-02 [--until <YYYY-MM-DD>] [--dir <path>] [--base <ref>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--since` | string | yes | — | the window's inclusive start, `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `--until` | string | no | now | the window's inclusive end, `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `--dir` | string | no | `.decisions` | the corpus whose landings are listed |
| `--base` | string | no | the trunk | the ref whose history is walked; fetched before the walk. With none named, the trunk (`origin/<the repo's GitHub default branch>`) is resolved after the window is validated, and an unresolvable one is `11` |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. First line: `digest\t<landed|none>\t<count>`. Then one line per landed
record, oldest first:
`landed\t<NNNN>\t<status>\t<commit>\t<YYYY-MM-DD>\t<anchors-touched>\t<title>` — where
`<anchors-touched>` is the number of anchored invariants the landing commit's own diff changed, the
blast-radius input the ranking needs.

With `--json`:
`{"outcome":"landed"|"none","count":<n>,"records":[{"id","status","commit","date","anchorsTouched","title","path"}…],"window":{"since","until"},"base":"origin/main"}`.

`none` is a **proven** answer at exit 0 — the window was walked and nothing landed in it. Empty
stdout would be byte-identical to a verb that never ran, which is the v1 scar this group's shared
conventions name.

**The `status` field is reported, never interpreted.** It is the frontmatter line as written. A corpus
can hold records that read `proposed` while being enforced at a live gate,
so a consumer that treats `proposed` as "not law" is reading a claim as an observation. The verb
prints what is there and the skill judges what it means.

**This verb ranks nothing.** Tension and blast radius are the two ruled ranking dimensions and both
are judgment; a ranking verb would be a second judgement wearing a verb's clothes, and would also
grow the rubric past what the founder's ruling authorized.

| `governance digest: walked <base> from <since> to <until>, <k> commits touching <dir>.` | 0 | notice |

**Scope** — the commits on `--base` between `--since` and `--until` that touch `--dir`, and for each
landed record its frontmatter and its landing commit's anchor delta. The scope line names the base,
the window and the commit count, because `none` is only readable against them.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika governance digest --since 2026-08-02
digest	landed	2
landed	0238	accepted	aab2adea	2026-08-06	0	fabrika reimplements v1, never calls it
landed	0240	accepted	1f8e83b1	2026-08-08	2	Only landed ADRs may be cited
```

```
$ fabrika governance digest --since 2026-08-09 --until 2026-08-09 --json
{"outcome":"none","count":0,"records":[],"window":{"since":"2026-08-09","until":"2026-08-09"},"base":"origin/main"}
```

The window is inclusive at both ends, so this second example is `none` only because neither landing
above falls on `2026-08-09` — `0240` lands on `2026-08-08` and would be inside a window ending there.

**Grounding**

- The founder's condition for retiring the human gate on decision records: a periodic,
  non-blocking digest of landed decisions, ranked by this skill. Without the readout,
  overrule-later is fiction, and that half is not droppable. This verb is the listing mechanics that
  ruling required to be a verb rather than prose in a skill.
- `status:` does not track what is binding; the field is reported verbatim and the
  hazard is stated rather than silently normalized.
- The base is fetched before the walk, because a stale checkout is how withdrawn doctrine
  gets applied after its withdrawal.
- `none` over a corpus that could not be read is not `none`; the read failure is `11`.

## `governance readout`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika governance readout [<issue>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

The ranked rows arrive on **stdin** — one row per line in the `governance-digest` line grammar.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | no | resolved, see below | the issue number of the durable readout artifact the front door reads. **Not a constant**: resolve it from `$FABRIKA_GOVERNANCE_READOUT_ISSUE`, else the single open issue in the target repo titled exactly `Governance readout`; a caller may always pass it explicitly. Unset and unresolvable is exit `7` naming both lookups — never a guessed number, which would publish the digest onto somebody else's issue |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |
| stdin | text | yes | — | the ranked rows: `row\t<NNNN>\t<tension\|blast\|routine>\t<one-line note>`, highest consequence first |

**Output** — machine channel. One line:
`readout\t<issue>\t<row-count>\t<created|edited>\t<comment-url>`.
With `--json`: `{"outcome":"readout","issue":…,"rows":<n>,"upsert":"created"|"edited","commentUrl":…}`.

**The row vocabulary is closed**, and the verb refuses a row outside it. The three kinds are
`tension` (the record sits against standing law), `blast` (wide reach, no tension found) and
`routine`. Free prose is confined to the one-line note, and the note is a *pointer*, not a
judgement a receiver acts on: the front door re-fetches the referenced records and reads them
itself. That is what keeps a coordination artifact from steering its receiver.

**Non-blocking by construction.** This verb writes a comment and nothing else. It sets no label,
touches no PR, and has no exit code meaning "the corpus is in a bad state" — because a digest that
could red would be the human gate the founder's ruling retired, wearing a new name. Every outcome here
is either "the readout landed" or "the readout did not land".

**The operation:** compose the rows through the `governance-digest` wire format's `emit`;
leak-scan the assembled body; upsert the single comment on the artifact issue whose first non-blank
line reads as this format; re-fetch and read it back through the format's `read`, requiring the same
rows in the same order, then compare the whole body through `normalizeForReadback`.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing — an empty readout is not a readout |
| `5` | the assembled body carries a machine-local path |
| `6` | the body is a bare `@` path reference |
| `7` | the artifact issue is proven absent (404) or closed — the readout has nowhere durable to land |
| `8` | the create/edit failed — UNKNOWN whether the readout landed |
| `9` | it landed but the read-back does not yield the same rows in the same order |
| `10` | a row's kind is outside `tension` / `blast` / `routine`, or a row's id is not four digits |
| `11` | the issue or its comments could not be read — nothing was written |
| `13` | the comment enumeration is provably short of its declared count, so the upsert target is unknown |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `governance readout: no rows on stdin — an empty readout is not a readout.` | 3 | refusal |
| `governance readout: the assembled body carries a machine-local path at line <k> (<class>) — cite it repo-relative.` | 5 | refusal |
| `governance readout: the body is a bare "@" path reference — the rows never arrived. Send them on stdin.` | 6 | refusal |
| `governance readout: issue #<n> not found in <repo> — the readout artifact is absent; front-door creates it.` | 7 | refusal |
| ``governance readout: no artifact issue given, `$FABRIKA_GOVERNANCE_READOUT_ISSUE` is unset, and <repo> has no open issue titled "Governance readout" — refusing to guess where the digest lands.`` | 7 | refusal |
| `governance readout: issue #<n> is closed — a readout nobody reads is not a readout.` | 7 | refusal |
| `governance readout: row <k>'s kind "<v>" is outside tension/blast/routine.` | 10 | refusal |
| `governance readout: row <k>'s id "<v>" is not a four-digit decision id.` | 10 | refusal |
| `governance readout: cannot read #<n>: <reason> — nothing was written.` | 11 | refusal |
| `governance readout: received <k> of <m> comments on #<n> — refusing to upsert against a partial sweep.` | 13 | refusal |
| `governance readout: create/edit failed: <reason> — UNKNOWN whether the readout landed; re-read #<n> before retrying.` | 8 | refusal |
| `governance readout: landed, but the read-back does not yield the same rows — inspect comment <id>.` | 9 | refusal |

**Scope** — one issue and its comments, plus the caller's stdin. The artifact is one comment,
upserted, so a reader always finds exactly one current readout rather than an append stream.

**Examples**

```
$ printf 'row\t0240\ttension\tsits against record 0058 on whether a verdict may bind an unread head\nrow\t0238\troutine\tno tension found\n' | fabrika governance readout 4952
readout	4952	2	edited	https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/4952#issuecomment-5229900001
```

```
$ printf 'row\t0240\troutine\tno tension found\n' | fabrika governance readout 4952 --json
{"outcome":"readout","issue":4952,"rows":1,"upsert":"edited","commentUrl":"https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/4952#issuecomment-5229900001"}
```

**Grounding**

- The readout is the non-droppable condition on retiring the human gate over decision records. The
  producer half is this verb; the display half is the front door's.
- The marker rule's second half — upsert, never append: one current record rather than a stream a
  timestamp decides between. The same reasoning applies to a readout as to a verdict.
- A periodic sweep re-files what a standing ruling already killed unless something stops it.
  The rows are authored per run by the skill, which cites the ruling and drops the row; this verb
  refuses nothing on that basis, because a verb that judged a row's novelty would be judging.
- Where skill routing cannot reach the front door at all, this artifact is still reachable: it is an
  issue precisely so it needs no routing.

## The eval-enumeration obligation (leaf rule)

Stated once, in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md)'s "Eval enumeration" section — the single home that
obligation lives in. This spec adds nothing to it, and the eval mechanics are a ticket of their own.

## Open questions this spec does not decide

- **Is a founder ruling recorded on an issue binding law for this judgement?** Unruled. Until it is,
  the conservative floor above holds: a ruling cited from an issue is evidence to name in a verdict
  body, never the sole ground for a FAIL, and a *relayed* ruling is indistinguishable from a
  fabricated one.
- **Does the fail-closed rule extend from zero scope to stale scope?** Unruled. This spec takes the
  conservative side already — every read fetches and binds — so a ruling either way leaves these
  verbs correct.
- **Does an enforcement row for a decision record belong to this skill's gate half or to `review`'s
  skill rubric?** Unruled. The gate-invariant judgement is this skill's, so the row lands here when
  it is ruled; nothing in this spec assumes it has been.
