- Upstream commit pinned: `b811c24365ae` (2026-09-03, "Stream complete skill-doctor
  session files") — the latest commit touching `.agents/skills/skill-doctor` at
  import time (2026-09-06).
- **Re-copy, never edit in place.** Every file listed as byte-exact below is upstream's; a
  change to any of them is made upstream and re-copied here, or it silently breaks the re-sync
  property this directory exists for. The fabrika-authored files are the editable surface.

Upstream's own `SKILL.md` (`9fd7d77d3b3944cbda2b09137001c25af08f598d` at the pinned commit) is
deliberately **not vendored** — it is superseded by the fabrika-authored routing surface below,
per [skill-conventions](../../docs/skill-conventions.md) §1/§2. Its content remains readable
upstream at the pinned commit.

## Fabrika-authored files — editable

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | Fabrika routing and orientation surface (conventions §1/§2). States what the skill is, when to fire it, the step flow with literal commands, and pointers into `contract.md` by section. |
| `contract.md` | The derived contract: collector flags, scoring contract, report artifacts — read by section via `fabrika wire doc-section`. |
| `scripts/test_fabrika_conformance.py` | Fabrika packaging conformance tests: doc-level checks that the authored surface carries session scoping, the scoring contract, failed-conversation-only edit gating, section addressability, and the documented limitations. Doc-level only — upstream behavior is the baseline target's job. |
| `PROVENANCE.md` | This file: the byte-exact/editable split and the re-sync procedure. |

Later work extends the fabrika-authored surface or lands new byte-exact re-copies — an opencode
collector, a portability patch, corpus discovery, report re-branding. Anyone who finds
themselves editing a byte-exact file must stop: either the change is upstreamed and re-copied at a new
pinned commit (this table updated with it), or the deviation is a decision that lands in the decision
corpus first.

## Re-sync procedure

1. Fetch upstream and find the latest commit touching `.agents/skills/skill-doctor`.
2. Re-copy each byte-exact file from that commit; never apply a local edit.
3. Re-verify every blob SHA against the upstream tree and update the pinned commit and this
   table together.
4. Leave the fabrika-authored files alone — they are not part of a re-sync.

If this procedure ever needs more than this file carries, it moves to a `.patterns/` doc rather
than growing here.
