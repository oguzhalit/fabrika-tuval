"""Fabrika packaging conformance for the vendored skill-doctor (#8048).

Doc-level conformance only. These tests assert that the shipped SKILL.md and
contract.md carry this child's required contracts — session scoping, the scoring
contract, failed-conversation-only edit gating, section addressability, and the
documented collector/discovery limitations. They prove the documentation exists
where the skill reads it; they prove nothing about the runtime behavior of the
upstream scripts. Upstream's own suites, run against upstream's own SKILL.md in
the separate baseline target, cover that code.

Fabrika-authored (editable) — see PROVENANCE.md.
