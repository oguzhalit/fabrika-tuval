# `/glossary` — derived CLI contract

**Skill:** [`glossary`](SKILL.md) · **Date:** 2026-08-10

The group is `glossary`, in `packages/fabrika-cli/`, invoked as `fabrika glossary <verb> …`. The
[CLI interface convention](../../docs/cli-interface-convention.md) governs all six; where this spec
and that doc disagree, the doc wins and this spec is the bug.

**`fabrika` calls the retired v1 pipeline CLI nowhere, and neither does the skill.** Every verb
below is implemented in `packages/fabrika-cli/`, and no fence in `SKILL.md` invokes anything else.
v1's drift tool and the v1 skill's three shell scripts were read for their semantics and their
scars — every scar named in a Grounding block below came from that reading — and none is called.

**Three questions were considered and deliberately not derived**, because each already has an
authority and a second answer could contradict it on a merge-gating question:

- **Machine-local paths in the register.** `leak-guard scan` runs on every changed markdown file at
  `.github/workflows/leak-guard.yml`, on `pull_request` **and** `merge_group`; `TERMS.md` is a doc
  surface by suffix. That gate is the authority. A fabrika copy could answer `clean` while the gate
  reds — the `adr classify` test, applied unchanged. Exit seats `5` and `6` are held empty for this
  reason rather than left unallocated.
- **Dead internal links in the register.** `.github/workflows/doc-links.yml` runs `lychee --offline`
  over every git-tracked `*.md`, on `pull_request` and `push: main`, fail-closed on zero scope.
  Repo-wide and merge-blocking; the same reasoning applies.
- **Control-plane classification.** Decided at the merge gate, never predicted here.

**Why a drift verb *is* derived, when the v1 tool computed something similar.** The v1 drift job was
**not** a gate: it ran on a weekly schedule and on manual dispatch, never on a pull request, was
absent from the required-context list, and its own header stated it was off the blocking path by
construction — extending it into a gate was considered and rejected. Nothing is enforced, so nothing
is contradicted, and fabrika implements its own rather than calling v1's.

## Verb inventory

| Verb | Purpose | Split test |
|---|---|---|
| `glossary init` | create an empty register with its header, so a fresh repo is not a dead end | the file's *shape* is fixed text; nothing about it is a decision |
| `glossary drift` | the surfaces that moved since a register last changed, and the candidate coinages in them | diff a range, extract phrases, subtract declared keys — arithmetic; only *whether a candidate earns a row* is judgement |
| `glossary lookup` | whether a term is already declared, and what overlaps it | string normalization and set membership against a parsed corpus; *whether two colliding terms are the same term* stays in the skill |
| `glossary sections` | the live section names of a register | parse headings; the enum is data, and reading it is not a decision |
| `glossary add` | insert or replace one row, alphabetically placed, byte-preserving elsewhere | placement, escaping and the diff-shape assertion are mechanical; the definition's content is entirely judgement |
| `glossary check` | row-shape, duplicate-key, ordering and citation-liveness defects in a register | each defect is a decidable predicate over the file; what to *do* about one is the skill's |

**Considered and not derived.** A verb to decide which register a term belongs to. It is the skill's
central judgement (domain noun vs architecture vocabulary), and a verb that guessed it would be
consulted exactly where it is least reliable. Recorded here so it is not re-proposed as a gap.

## Shared conventions

Every verb below obeys these; they are stated once rather than repeated per block.

- **Answer channel: machine.** Stdout carries the answer and nothing else. Scope lines, refusal
  reasons and progress go to stderr.
- **Common inputs.** `--register <terms|language|both>` selects the register; it is a closed enum and
  an off-enum value is exit `10`. `--dir <path>` (default `.glossary`) is the register directory.
  `--json` swaps the line grammar for the JSON shape given per verb, on stdout.
- **Register filenames** are `TERMS.md` and `LANGUAGE.md` under `--dir`. `both` means TERMS first,
  then LANGUAGE, in that order everywhere.
- **`--register both` is per-register, and one absent file never fails the other.** This is the
  single most load-bearing clause in the group, because a repo with only `TERMS.md` is the normal
  adopting case and both `lookup` and `check` default to `both`. The rule: **each selected register
  is resolved independently.** A register whose file is absent contributes `bootstrap` — it is not an
  error, and the other register still answers. A register whose file is present but *unreadable* is
  exit `11` for the whole run, because an unreadable file is UNKNOWN and a partial answer would be
  read as complete. So: absent degrades, unreadable refuses. Every verb's stderr scope line names
  each selected register and which of the three it was, so a caller can never mistake a
  single-register answer for a two-register one.
- **Precedence between `4` and the empty cases.** A register with **no term table at all** holds zero
  rows — that is `bootstrap` (absent file) or the verb's zero-row behaviour (present file), never
  `4`. Exit `4` fires only on a table that **exists and is malformed**: a header row without a
  separator, or rows whose cell count the parser cannot resolve. The fixture's `LANGUAGE.md` is the
  worked case — non-empty prose, no table — and it is zero rows, not `4`.
- **A non-zero exit is UNKNOWN.** No verb prints a partial or permissive answer on a non-zero exit. A
  proven negative — "absent", "clean", "no drift" — is an **answer on exit 0 with a positive state
  token**, never a non-zero exit. This is not a preference: `refuse()` in
  [`src/verb.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/verb.ts) hardcodes empty stdout and `answer()`
  hardcodes code `0`, so a non-zero exit carrying a machine payload is not constructible with the
  shipped helpers.
- **Repo-root resolution.** The register belongs to the *target repo*, so every verb resolves it with
  `discoverRepoRoot(process.cwd())` from
  [`src/delegate/root.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/delegate/root.ts) and reads through
  [`src/io/fs.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/io/fs.ts), whose doctrine — "I could not read
  this" is a failure, never an empty value — is the one this group needs most. No verb here reads
  plugin-shipped content, so the `PLUGIN_MANIFEST` walk in `src/status/roster.ts` is deliberately not
  used.
- **No verb in this group reaches GitHub or the network.** Every read is the local tree: the register
  files, the commit range, and the decision records under `--decisions`. The group therefore has no
  rate-limit code, no token input, and no REST/GraphQL question to answer — the
  [§11 rule](../../docs/skill-conventions.md) binds fabrika's GitHub-touching groups and this one
  simply is not among them. Stated rather than left silent, so a
  reader does not go looking for the network surface.

### Term normalization — one function, used by every verb

`normalizeKey(cell)` maps a first-cell string to its comparison key. Two implementers must compute
the same key, so this is exact:

1. Strip a leading and trailing run of backticks, `*` and `_`.
2. Lowercase with `String.prototype.toLocaleLowerCase()` — **Unicode-aware, not `[a-z]`-restricted**,
   so `Gündem` and `gündem` are one key and `İzleme` is not silently dropped.
3. Replace every run of `-`, `_` or whitespace with a single space.
4. Trim.

**What it deliberately does not do:** it does not split on `(`, `/` or `,`. The whole cell is one
key. `gündem (gundem)` is a single term whose key is `gündem (gundem)`, and `tag` is a different term
from `Database (tag)`. Splitting a parenthetical into an alias is the defect that produced three
false duplicates when it was last attempted — a parenthetical in a vocabulary register is a
disambiguating qualifier, not a synonym.

**Overlap** — used only by `lookup` — is defined against the normalized keys: key `a` overlaps key
`b` when `a !== b` and one contains the other **as a whole-word span** (the match must begin at a
word boundary and end at one). `front door` overlaps `front door detection`; it does not overlap
`storefront doorway`.

### Exit codes

`glossary` is an **aligned** group: it ships `packages/fabrika-cli/src/glossary/codes.ts` and
**imports** each shared meaning from `packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/codes.ts` rather than restating
a numeral, which is what makes a drift there unrepresentable. It must be registered in
`ALIGNED_GROUPS` in
[`src/exit-code-alignment.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/exit-code-alignment.ts) and in
the `TABLES` map of its unit test, or the coverage guard reds the moment the group is registered.

| Code | Meaning | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | the answer is on stdout | reserved |
| `1` | usage error, or the verb failed to run | reserved |
| `126` | no implementation could be resolved | reserved |
| `127` | the verb never ran | reserved |
| `3` | `EMPTY_STDIN` — stdin was read and held nothing | import from `report` (`EMPTY_STDIN`) |
| `4` | `BAD_SECTIONS` — the register was read and a structure this verb needs (its term table, or its headings) is unusable | import from `report` (`BAD_SECTIONS`) |
| `5` | held empty — see below | leak detection is the merge gate's |
| `6` | held empty — see below | as above |
| `7` | `ZERO_SCOPE` — a judging verb scanned nothing it could judge | import from `report` (`NO_TARGET`) |
| `8` | `WRITE_UNKNOWN` — the register write failed; the outcome is UNKNOWN | import from `report` (`WRITE_UNKNOWN`) |
| `9` | `READBACK_MISMATCH` — the write landed and the re-read differs from intent | import from `report` (`READBACK_MISMATCH`) |
| `10` | `OFF_VOCABULARY` — a closed-enum flag carried an off-enum value | import from `report` (`CLASSIFIED`) |
| `11` | `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN` — a precondition read failed; nothing was written | import from `report` (`PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN`) |
| `12` | `TERM_COLLISION` — the term is already declared; `add` refused | group-local |
| `13` | `SECTION_ABSENT` — the named section is not in the register | group-local |
| `14` | `ROW_SHAPE_INVALID` — the composed row cannot be a well-formed table row | group-local |
| `15` | `EDIT_BEYOND_ROW` — the write would have changed a line outside the target row | group-local |

Every verb can additionally return `0`, `1`, `126` and `127`; the per-verb tables below enumerate only
that verb's own proven outcomes from `3` up, so no fact has two homes.

**The seats map.** None of the shipped seat sets fits: `BUILD_SEATS` carries `LEAKED_PATH` and
`BARE_AT_PATH`, which this group deliberately does not claim. The implementation declares
`GLOSSARY_SEATS` — `BUILD_SEATS` minus those two — and registers `glossary` under it in
`ALIGNED_GROUPS`.

**`5` and `6` are held empty, not free**, so a later author does not re-seat a different meaning on a
number the base already owns. Only **`5`** carries the `DELIBERATE_GAP` export, because
`exit-code-alignment.ts` matches that one exact name (`GAP_EXPORT`) and a second export of it is a
TypeScript error while a renamed one reads as an allocation and reds as a collision. `6` is held by
this paragraph and by `codes.ts` simply never allocating it — a gap the guard sees as unclaimed,
which is the correct reading. Do not invent `DELIBERATE_GAP_2`.

## `glossary init`

Creates a register file that does not exist. Without it `bootstrap` is a state the skill can reach
and never leave: `add` requires a `--section` matched against live headings, and a file that is not
there has none. This verb is why a repo adopting fabrika on day one can run this skill at all.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika glossary init --register terms [--dir <path>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--register` | enum `terms\|language` | yes | — | which register to create; `both` is refused, so the two are never created by one ambiguous call |
| `--dir` | string | no | `.glossary` | the directory to create the register in; created if absent |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the creation record instead of the line grammar |

**Output** — machine channel. One **tab-separated** line: `<action>`, `<path>` — where `action` is
`created`. With `--json`, one object with keys `action`, `path`, `register`.

The file's bytes are this template, and **this block is its single home**:

```markdown
# <repo> domain vocabulary (TERMS)

The repo-owned vocabulary spine. One row per term: the canonical definition, and where a name has
drifted, what the term is **not**. When the code and this file disagree, the code is authoritative
and this file is the doc to fix.
```

For `--register language` the H1 reads `# <repo> architecture vocabulary (LANGUAGE)` and the body
sentence names the architecture vocabulary instead. `<repo>` is the target repo root's directory
name. **No section is scaffolded** — an empty section invites filler, and `add --create-section`
writes the first one with the row that justifies it.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | the file was created and its path is on stdout |
| `8` | the write failed; the outcome is UNKNOWN |
| `9` | the file was written and the read-back does not match the template |
| `10` | `--register both` was given, or a closed-enum flag carried an off-enum value |
| `12` | the register already exists — refused, never overwritten |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `glossary init: <path> already exists — refusing to overwrite a register.` | 12 | refusal |
| `glossary init: --register both is not creatable — create each register explicitly.` | 10 | usage error |
| `glossary init: cannot write <path>: <reason> — the outcome is UNKNOWN.` | 8 | refusal |
| `glossary init: wrote <path> and the read-back does not match the template.` | 9 | refusal |

**Scope** — not a judging verb. It creates exactly one file and never edits an existing one.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika glossary init --register terms --dir /tmp/fresh/.glossary
created	/tmp/fresh/.glossary/TERMS.md
```

```
$ fabrika glossary init --register terms --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/registers
glossary init: packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/registers/TERMS.md already exists — refusing to overwrite a register.
$ echo $?
12
```

**Grounding**

- **Working in a foreign repo is a release criterion.** Without this verb the documented bootstrap
  path terminates in `add` exit `13` with no section to name, which is a first-run dead end rather
  than a fail-loud.
- The refusal-on-existing rule is `adr new`'s exit `3` idiom, reseated on this group's `12`: a
  register is the one artifact whose accidental overwrite destroys the most work.

## `glossary drift`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika glossary drift [--register <terms|language|both>] [--dir <path>] [--paths <a,b>] [--limit <n>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--register` | enum `terms\|language\|both` | no | `terms` | which register's last change bounds the diff and supplies the declared keys |
| `--dir` | string | no | `.glossary` | the directory holding the registers |
| `--paths` | string | no | every tracked path in the repo root | comma-separated pathspecs to diff; the default is the whole tree, never a fixed layout |
| `--limit` | integer | no | `40` | how many candidates to emit, highest-ranked first |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the drift result as one JSON object on stdout |

**Output** — machine channel. The first line is the outcome token alone: `drift`, `clean` or
`bootstrap`. On `drift`, one **tab-separated** line per candidate follows: `<phrase>`, `<hits>`,
`<first-surface>`.

`hits` is the number of distinct commits in the range whose subject or body contains the phrase.
Order is `hits` descending, ties broken by the phrase ascending byte-wise; `--limit` then takes the
first `n`. `first-surface` is the repo-relative path of the first file, in `git diff --name-only`
order, changed by the earliest commit contributing a hit.

With `--json`, one object with keys `outcome`, `candidates` (array of `{phrase, hits, firstSurface}`,
empty unless `outcome` is `drift`), `reason` (string or `null`), `sinceCommit`, `scannedCommits`,
`declaredKeys`.

**Candidate extraction** — deterministic, and stated in full so two implementers agree:

1. **The range.** `sinceCommit` is the newest commit that touched the resolved register file. The
   range is `sinceCommit..HEAD`.
2. **The text.** For each commit in the range, its subject and body.
3. **Phrases.** Every double-quoted or backticked span, plus every 2-word and 3-word n-gram of the
   subject line. Tokens are split on runs of characters outside Unicode letter, digit, `-` and `_`.
4. **Filter.** Drop any phrase whose every token is a stopword, and any phrase containing a token
   shorter than 3 characters that is not itself a declared key.
5. **Suppression.** Drop a phrase whose `normalizeKey` **equals** a declared key of the selected
   register(s). Suppression is **equality on the normalized key, never substring containment in
   either direction.**

**Stopwords** — exactly the list in
[`src/adr/sweep.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/adr/sweep.ts), imported rather than
restated, so the two term-extraction surfaces cannot drift apart. **That list is module-private
today (`const STOPWORDS`), so this contract requires the implementer to `export` it** and import the
set here — a one-line change to a shipped module, and the alternative is a second copy of a list that
then drifts.

**Import the set and nothing else.** `sweep.ts` also exports `tokenize`, which splits on
`[^a-z0-9]+` after lowercasing — the ASCII-only behaviour this verb's Grounding names as the reason
every Turkish product noun was invisible to v1. Reusing it would re-import the exact defect step 3
exists to fix. Step 3's Unicode split is this group's own.

**Scope** — every commit in `sinceCommit..HEAD` touching `--paths`, and the declared keys of the
selected register(s). The scope line goes to stderr on every run, naming `sinceCommit`, the commit
count and the declared-key count.

**The three outcomes, disjoint by construction.**

- **`bootstrap`** — `--dir` was read, and it holds no register file for the selected register, or one
  that parses to zero rows. Both are facts about an adopting repo, not failed reads — working in a
  foreign repo is a release criterion. A `--dir` that could not be read at all is
  UNKNOWN, and that is exit `11` — the distinction is the directory, not the file.
- **`clean`** — the range was computed and every candidate was suppressed or filtered.
- **`drift`** — at least one candidate survived.

**The `reason` string is fixed text, byte for byte**, because a caller may grep it:

| Outcome | `reason` |
|---|---|
| `bootstrap`, file absent | `no register at <path> — this repo has not adopted one yet, which is bootstrap, not empty drift` |
| `bootstrap`, file empty | `the register at <path> parsed to 0 rows — bootstrap, not empty drift` |
| `clean` | `swept <n> commit(s) since <sha>; every candidate was already declared — this is a clean sweep, not an unread range` |
| `drift` | `null` |

The same sentence reaches stderr as `glossary drift: <reason>.`

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | an outcome token was produced on stdout |
| `4` | the register was read but its table structure is unparseable, so the declared set is UNKNOWN |
| `7` | `--paths` was given and matched zero tracked files, so the diff scanned nothing |
| `10` | `--register` carried a value off its closed enum |
| `11` | `--dir` could not be read, or the commit range could not be computed |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `glossary drift: cannot read <dir>: <reason> — the declared set is UNKNOWN, never "0 declared".` | 11 | refusal |
| `glossary drift: --paths <value> matched 0 tracked files — refusing to report a clean sweep of nothing.` | 7 | refusal |
| `glossary drift: cannot resolve the commit that last changed <path>: <reason> — the range is UNKNOWN, never "never committed".` | 11 | refusal |
| `glossary drift: <path> has no parseable term table — the declared set is UNKNOWN.` | 4 | refusal |
| `glossary drift: --register "<value>" is not one of terms, language, both.` | 10 | usage error |

**Examples**

The two outcomes whose every printed byte is derivable from this spec — an absent register, and a
register that exists with nothing outstanding against it:

```
$ fabrika glossary drift --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/empty
bootstrap
$ echo $?
0
```

```
$ fabrika glossary drift --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/registers --paths packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary
clean
$ echo $?
0
```

The pathspec names a directory that exists and is tracked. **A `--paths` that matches nothing is exit
`7`, not `clean`** — a pathspec pointed at a layout the repo does not have is precisely how v1
reported "no drift" forever, and answering `clean` there would rebuild that defect on the flag after
removing it from the default:

```
$ fabrika glossary drift --paths no/such/dir
glossary drift: --paths no/such/dir matched 0 tracked files — refusing to report a clean sweep of nothing.
$ echo $?
7
```

With `--json`, the same `clean` run carries the pinned `reason` and the counts the outcome is only
readable against:

```
$ fabrika glossary drift --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/registers --paths packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary --json
{"outcome":"clean","candidates":[],"reason":"swept 0 commit(s) since 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000; every candidate was already declared — this is a clean sweep, not an unread range","sinceCommit":"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000","scannedCommits":0,"declaredKeys":5}
```

`declaredKeys` is `5` because the fixture register's six rows normalize to five distinct keys — the
planted `pano` duplicate collapses, which is the point of counting keys rather than rows.
`sinceCommit` is shown as the all-zero sha only to keep this example free of a real commit id, and a
live run prints the sha that last touched the register.

A `drift` run's `hits` and `first-surface` are computed over the commit range
`sinceCommit..HEAD`, which moves with the repository. **The following two data lines are sample
data, not a reproducible run** — the line *grammar* is the contract, the values are not. Pinning a
number here would leave a reader treating an unverifiable value as a contract, and a spec's example
value is derivable or it is absent:

```
drift
capture ledger	3	src/capture/ledger.ts
retry budget	2	src/net/retry.ts
```

```
$ fabrika glossary drift --dir /nonexistent
glossary drift: cannot read /nonexistent: ENOENT — the declared set is UNKNOWN, never "0 declared".
$ echo $?
11
```

The message names the **directory**, because that is where the distinction lives: a `--dir` that
cannot be read is UNKNOWN, while a `--dir` that reads and holds no register file is `bootstrap` on
exit `0`. A message naming the file would blur the two states this verb exists to keep apart.

Note the two absences are different answers: a `--dir` that cannot be read is exit `11`, while a
readable directory holding no register file is `bootstrap` on exit `0`.

**Grounding**

- v1's `glossary-drift.sh` laundered a failed `git log` into a confident verdict: it captured the
  commit into `LAST` without checking the status, then read an empty `LAST` as "never committed" and
  exited 4 (BOOTSTRAP). A shallow clone — `actions/checkout`'s default depth — reproduces that on a
  register that *is* committed, sending a caller to regenerate a populated file. Here an unresolvable
  range is exit `11` and `bootstrap` is reachable only from a file that was read.
- v1's script also printed nothing at all on a clean sweep, making "no drift" byte-identical to a run
  that died early; the `clean` token and its pinned `reason` exist for that.
- **v1 defaulted the diff to a literal two-directory pathspec**, so any repo with a different layout
  got a permanently empty diff that read as "no drift". `--paths` defaults to the whole tree.
- **The v1 tokenizer was `/\b[a-z][a-z-]+\b/g`**, which excludes uppercase and all non-ASCII — so
  every non-ASCII product noun the glossary exists for was structurally invisible. Step 3 splits on
  Unicode letter classes instead.
- The same tool suppressed a candidate when a declared term contained it **or** it contained a
  declared term. Against a register of any size most short candidates contain some declared key,
  which inverts the stated recall bias; measured precision across four fires was about 10%. Step 5
  is equality on the normalized key.
- **Glossary maintenance stays off the fail-closed per-PR gate.** This verb reports; it never reds a
  merge.

## `glossary lookup`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika glossary lookup "front door" [--register <terms|language|both>] [--dir <path>] [--json]
```

One or more terms may be given; each produces one line, in argument order. One read serves them all.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<term>...` | positional string, repeatable | yes | — | the terms to resolve against the register(s) |
| `--register` | enum `terms\|language\|both` | no | `both` | which register(s) to resolve against |
| `--dir` | string | no | `.glossary` | the directory holding the registers |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit a JSON array instead of the line grammar |

**Output** — machine channel. One **tab-separated** line per term: `<state>`, `<register>`,
`<section>`, `<matched>`.

| `state` | `register` | `section` | `matched` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `declared` | `terms` or `language` | the section heading text, verbatim | the declared first cell, verbatim |
| `collision` | the register of the first overlapping key | that key's section | every overlapping declared cell, comma-separated, in file order |
| `absent` | `-` | `-` | `-` |

With `--json`, a **JSON array** — one object per term, in argument order, with keys `term`,
`normalized`, `state`, `register`, `section`, `matched` (array). An array rather than JSON-lines, so
one term and many terms parse identically.

**`declared` beats `collision` beats `absent`.** A term whose normalized key equals a declared key is
`declared` even when it also overlaps others. With `--register both`, TERMS is searched before
LANGUAGE and the first `declared` wins; a term declared in **both** registers is still reported once,
as `declared` in TERMS, and is a defect `glossary check` reports separately — one term, one
register.

**All three states are answers on exit 0.** `absent` means *proven absent against a register that was
read* — never what a failed read prints.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | a state line was produced for every term given |
| `4` | a selected register has no parseable term table, so membership is UNKNOWN |
| `10` | `--register` carried a value off its closed enum |
| `11` | a selected register could not be read, so every state is UNKNOWN |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `glossary lookup: cannot read <path>: <reason> — every state is UNKNOWN, never "absent".` | 11 | refusal |
| `glossary lookup: <path> has no parseable term table (<reason>) — membership is UNKNOWN, never "absent".` | 4 | refusal |
| `glossary lookup: --register "<value>" is not one of terms, language, both.` | 10 | usage error |
| `glossary lookup: no term given.` | 1 | usage error |

**Scope** — every parsed row of the selected register(s). A register that exists and holds zero rows
is a fact and answers `absent` for every term, for the same reason `drift` answers `bootstrap`; the
scope line names the row count per register so a caller can tell that from a populated corpus.

**Examples**

Every example resolves against the committed fixture register, never the host repo's live one, so
each printed cell reproduces:

```
$ fabrika glossary lookup "pano" --register terms --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/registers
declared	terms	Core / shape	pano
```

`pano` is declared twice in that fixture; TERMS is searched in file order and the first hit wins, so
the `Core / shape` row is reported. The duplication itself is `glossary check`'s finding, not
`lookup`'s.

```
$ fabrika glossary lookup "tag" --register terms --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/registers
collision	terms	Indexing	Database (tag)
```

The parenthetical is a qualifier, so `tag` is not `declared` — it is reported as overlapping and the
skill judges whether the two are one term.

```
$ fabrika glossary lookup "de-po" "capture ledger" --register terms --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/registers
declared	terms	Products (domains)	depo
absent	-	-	-
```

`de-po` matches the declared `depo` because normalization folds hyphens away before comparing.

**Grounding**

- **v1's drift tool had no duplicate-term check**, so a same-anchor coining collision landed
  silently and two terms ended up defined twice. Reusing its alias-splitting was tried and produced
  three false positives, which is why the whole cell is one key here.
- **v1's `normalize` folded case and whitespace but not hyphens**, so a declared `front-door` never
  suppressed `front door`.
- **A term with two live senses is disambiguated by namespace and keeps its name**, so a collision
  is a question for the skill, not something a verb resolves.

## `glossary sections`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika glossary sections [--register <terms|language|both>] [--dir <path>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--register` | enum `terms\|language\|both` | no | `terms` | which register's sections to list |
| `--dir` | string | no | `.glossary` | the directory holding the registers |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit a JSON array instead of the line grammar |

**Output** — machine channel. One **tab-separated** line per section, in file order: `<register>`,
`<section>`, `<rows>`. With `--json`, an array of `{register, section, rows}`.

**A heading is a line matching `^##[ \t]+\S`** — the space after the hashes is required by the
markdown spec and is load-bearing here. A register's prose can wrap so a paragraph line begins with
a `#` and digits — a citation carried onto its own line — and a scan for `^#` reports that as a
phantom section. A section's rows are the table rows between its heading and the next heading of
level 1 or 2, excluding the header row and the
`---` separator row, and prose paragraphs between the heading and the table are skipped rather than
treated as rows.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | one line per section was produced, or the register is empty (see Scope) |
| `4` | the register is non-empty, holds no `^##[ \t]+\S` heading, **and** carries table rows — content that exists under no section |
| `10` | `--register` carried a value off its closed enum |
| `11` | the register could not be read |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `glossary sections: cannot read <path>: <reason> — the section list is UNKNOWN, never empty.` | 11 | refusal |
| `glossary sections: <path> carries <n> table row(s) under no "## " heading — the section list is UNKNOWN.` | 4 | refusal |
| `glossary sections: --register "<value>" is not one of terms, language, both.` | 10 | usage error |

**Scope** — the selected register file(s). A file that **does not exist, or exists and is empty of
headings**, prints the single line `-\tbootstrap\t0` and exits `0`: an adopting repo has no sections
yet, and that is an answer. The scope line on stderr names the file and its byte length.

**There is no exit-0-with-empty-stdout path.** A zero-byte register still prints the `bootstrap`
line, because an answer that prints nothing is byte-identical to a verb that never ran (interface
rule 2). Exit `4` is reserved for a file that is non-empty, holds no `^##[ \t]+\S` heading, **and**
carries table rows — content the verb can see but cannot place under any section.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika glossary sections --register terms --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/registers
terms	Core / shape	2
terms	Products (domains)	3
terms	Indexing	1
```

```
$ fabrika glossary sections --register terms --dir /tmp/fresh-repo/.glossary
-	bootstrap	0
$ echo $?
0
```

**Grounding**

- **The phantom-heading case is real, not hypothetical**: a live register carries a paragraph line
  wrapped so it starts with a `#`-prefixed number, and a `^#` scan counts it as a section.
- A register's sections are data that grows with the repo, so the skill reads them rather than
  carrying a list that rots — the same reason the verb index is derived from the registry rather than
  hand-maintained (interface convention rule 1).

## `glossary add`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika glossary add "front door" --register terms --section "fabrika skill nouns" --definition-file -
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<term>` | positional string | yes | — | the term, written into the row's first cell verbatim |
| `--register` | enum `terms\|language` | yes | — | which register to write; `both` is refused, since a term has one register |
| `--section` | string | yes | — | the section heading to insert under, matched verbatim against the live headings |
| `--definition-file` | string | yes | — | the file holding the definition cell, or `-` for stdin |
| `--not-file` | string | no | none | a file holding the `Not` cell; omitted means an empty third cell |
| `--replace` | boolean | no | `false` | rewrite the existing row for this term instead of refusing on collision |
| `--create-section` | boolean | no | `false` | create `--section` at the end of the register when it does not exist, instead of refusing with `13` |
| `--dir` | string | no | `.glossary` | the directory holding the registers |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the edit record instead of the line grammar |

**Output** — machine channel. One **tab-separated** line: `<action>`, `<path>`, `<section>`,
`<line>` — where `action` is `added` or `replaced` and `line` is the 1-based line number the row now
occupies. With `--json`, one object with keys `action`, `path`, `section`, `line`, `term`,
`normalized`.

**Placement.** The row is inserted so the section's rows are in ascending `normalizeKey` order,
compared with `Intl.Collator("en", {sensitivity: "base"})`. Where the section's existing rows are
**not** already sorted, the row is placed at the first position that keeps it ordered relative to its
immediate neighbours, and a note goes to stderr naming the section as unsorted — the verb never
re-sorts rows it was not asked to write.

**Cell escaping.** A literal `|` in any cell is written as `\|`, and every newline is replaced with a
single space, because a table row is one line. A definition that is empty after this normalization is
exit `14`.

**`--create-section` appends a new section** — a blank line, the `## <section>` heading, the
`| Term | Definition | Not |` header, the `|---|---|---|` separator, and the row — at the end of the
register, and reports `added`. It is the only path that writes more than one line, so the invariant
below admits exactly that five-line block when the flag is given and the section is genuinely
absent. Sections are never reordered.

**The one-row invariant, enforced in code.** The verb reads the file, composes the new text, and
asserts before writing that the result differs from the original in exactly one added line (`added`)
or one changed line (`replaced`) and nowhere else — or, under `--create-section`, in exactly the
five appended lines above and nowhere else. Any other diff shape aborts the write with exit
`15` and nothing is written. This is the deterministic test the implementation owes, and it is what
makes "change only the affected rows, do not re-sort the file" a mechanism rather than a hope.

**Read-back.** After writing, the file is re-read and the row at the reported line is parsed back. If
its three cells do not match what was composed, the verb exits `9` — the write landed and the result
is not what was intended, which is a different fact from a write that failed (`8`).

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | the row was written and the result is on stdout |
| `3` | `--definition-file -` was given and stdin held nothing |
| `4` | the register has no parseable table under `--section` |
| `8` | the write failed; the register's state is UNKNOWN |
| `9` | the write landed and the read-back does not match what was composed |
| `10` | `--register both` was given, or a closed-enum flag carried an off-enum value |
| `11` | a precondition read failed — the register, or `--definition-file`, could not be read; nothing was written |
| `12` | the term is already declared and `--replace` was not given |
| `13` | `--section` names no heading in the register |
| `14` | the composed row cannot be a well-formed table row |
| `15` | the write would have changed a line outside the target row — aborted, nothing written |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `glossary add: <term> is already declared in <register> under "<section>" — pass --replace to rewrite it.` | 12 | refusal |
| `glossary add: "<section>" is not a section of <path> — run "fabrika glossary sections" for the live list.` | 13 | refusal |
| `glossary add: the definition is empty after normalization — refusing to write a blank row.` | 14 | refusal |
| `glossary add: stdin held nothing.` | 3 | refusal |
| `glossary add: --register both is not writable — a term belongs to one register.` | 10 | usage error |
| `glossary add: cannot read <path>: <reason> — nothing was written.` | 11 | refusal |
| `glossary add: cannot write <path>: <reason> — the register's state is UNKNOWN, re-read it before retrying.` | 8 | refusal |
| `glossary add: wrote <path> and the read-back differs at line <n> — the register may be inconsistent.` | 9 | refusal |
| `glossary add: the edit would have changed <n> line(s) beyond the target row — aborted, nothing written.` | 15 | refusal |
| `glossary add: <path> has no parseable table under "<section>" — the insertion point is UNKNOWN, nothing written.` | 4 | refusal |
| `glossary add: cannot read --definition-file <path>: <reason> — nothing was written.` | 11 | refusal |
| `glossary add: --replace was given and <term> is not declared in <register> — refusing to rewrite a row that does not exist.` | 12 | refusal |

**Precedence among the refusals, so two implementers order them the same way.** Checks run:
`--register both` (`10`) → the register reads (`11`) → `--section` exists (`13`) → that section holds
a parseable table (`4`) → the definition source reads and is non-empty (`11`, then `3`) → the
composed row is well formed (`14`) → the collision test (`12`) → the write (`8`) → the one-row
assertion (`15`) → the read-back (`9`). So a bad `--section` reports `13`, never `4`; `4` fires only
when the section heading exists and its table does not.

**`--replace` on an absent term is exit `12`, not a silent add.** The flag asks to rewrite a specific
row; if that row is not there, the caller's belief about the register is wrong and adding anyway
would hide it.

**Scope** — not a judging verb. It reads one register and writes one row in it.

**Examples**

Both run against the committed fixture register, so the section, the ordering and the resulting line
number all reproduce. `capture ledger` sorts before `depo`, so it lands as the first row of the
`Products (domains)` table:

```
$ printf 'The append-only record of one capture run.' | fabrika glossary add "capture ledger" --register terms --section "Products (domains)" --definition-file - --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/registers
added	packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/registers/TERMS.md	Products (domains)	18
```

Line `18` is derivable from the committed fixture: `## Products (domains)` is line 14, line 15 is
blank, the column row is 16, the separator 17, and the section's three data rows are `depo` (18),
`pano` (19), `sozluk` (20). `capture ledger` sorts before `depo`, so it takes that first data-row
position — line 18 — and the three rows below shift down by one. Against any other corpus the number
is whatever that corpus makes it, which is why the example pins a fixture rather than the live
register.

```
$ printf 'x' | fabrika glossary add "pano" --register terms --section "Core / shape" --definition-file - --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/registers
glossary add: pano is already declared in terms under "Core / shape" — pass --replace to rewrite it.
$ echo $?
12
```

With `--replace`, the same invocation rewrites that row and reports the action:

```
$ printf 'The board product.' | fabrika glossary add "pano" --register terms --section "Core / shape" --definition-file - --replace --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/registers
replaced	packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/registers/TERMS.md	Core / shape	11
```

**Grounding**

- v1's CLI trusted the response of the write it made and never re-read the artifact; the read-back
  and exit `9` exist so "wrote it" and "it is there" stay separate facts.
- The one-row assertion is the `adr supersede` idiom (its exit `6`), reseated here on this group's
  `15`. A group allocates its own seat for a shared refusal rather than importing a sibling's private
  number.
- **A row can define itself by a retired model.** The `control-plane` row did: its `Not` column
  excluded the sanctioned path. `--replace` exists because a register that can only be appended to
  accumulates wrong answers.

## `glossary check`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika glossary check [--register <terms|language|both>] [--dir <path>] [--decisions <path>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--register` | enum `terms\|language\|both` | no | `both` | which register(s) to check |
| `--dir` | string | no | `.glossary` | the directory holding the registers |
| `--decisions` | string | no | the repo's `decisionsDir` | the decision-record directory citations resolve against; an override, and the only way to read a corpus in a repo that declares it keeps none |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the check result as one JSON object on stdout |

**Output** — machine channel. The first line is the outcome token alone: `clean`, `defects` or
`bootstrap`. On `defects`, one **tab-separated** line per finding follows: `<kind>`, `<register>`,
`<section>`, `<term>`, `<detail>`.

`kind` is a closed set:

| `kind` | Fires when |
|---|---|
| `row-shape` | the row does not have exactly three cells, or a cell is empty where the shape requires content |
| `duplicate-key` | two rows in the selected registers share a `normalizeKey` |
| `cross-register` | one key is declared in both TERMS and LANGUAGE — one term, one register |
| `out-of-order` | a row precedes a row that sorts before it within its section |
| `citation-dead` | a cited `NNNN` decision id has no record under the resolved corpus |
| `citation-superseded` | a cited record exists and its frontmatter `status:` is not live |
| `citations-unverified` | at least one citation is in scope and the corpus could not be read, or the repo declares `decisionsDir: null` and keeps none — either way no citation in scope was resolved. A register citing **nothing** never fires it: with no citation to settle, no corpus is consulted and the run is `clean` |

A citation is a four-digit token in a row's second or third cell. **Live** is decided by importing
`isLive` from [`src/adr/records.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/adr/records.ts) rather than
restating it, so the two groups cannot disagree about what a status word means. That function admits
exactly three arms — the status is `accepted`, or exactly `amended-in-part`, or begins
`amended-in-part by`. A looser paraphrase such as "begins `amended-in-part`" is **wrong**: it would
call `amended-in-part (9250)` live where the imported predicate does not.

**`detail` is fixed text per `kind`**, because a caller may grep it:

| `kind` | `detail` |
|---|---|
| `row-shape` | `expected 3 cells, found <n>` — or `cell <1\|2> is empty` |
| `duplicate-key` | `also declared in "<section>"` — naming the **earlier** occurrence; the finding is reported against the **later** row |
| `cross-register` | `also declared in <register> under "<section>"` |
| `out-of-order` | `sorts before "<the preceding row's term>"` |
| `citation-dead` | `cites <NNNN>, no record under <decisions-dir>` |
| `citation-superseded` | `cites <NNNN>, status "<the frontmatter status line, verbatim>"` |
| `citations-unverified` | `cannot read <decisions-dir>: <reason>` |

**`row-shape` requires content in cells 1 and 2 only.** The third cell — `Not` — is legitimately
empty on most rows and an empty one is never a finding; the fixture register carries two such rows
deliberately.

With `--json`, one object with keys `outcome`, `findings` (array of
`{kind, register, section, term, detail}`), `reason` (string or `null`), `scannedRows`,
`scannedRegisters`, `citationsResolved`.

**All three outcomes are answers on exit 0**, because the outcome is this verb's own verdict and a
caller must never read its own finding list as a failed run — the mistake v1's `adr-sweep` made by
exiting non-zero on the one case it was asked to produce.

**The `reason` string is fixed text, byte for byte:**

| Outcome | `reason` |
|---|---|
| `bootstrap` | `no register at <path> — nothing to check yet, which is bootstrap, not clean` |
| `clean` | `checked <n> row(s) across <m> register(s); no defect found` |
| `defects` | `null` |

**Scope** — every parsed row of the selected register(s), plus every decision record a row cites,
resolved against the corpus `decisionsDir` declares unless `--decisions` overrides it. The
scope line goes to stderr naming the row count per register and the number of citations resolved, or
the reason none were.

**Zero scope is a red for this verb, with one carved-out exception.** A selected register that is
present and parses to **zero rows** is exit `7`: a check that scanned nothing must never report
`clean`. The exception is a register file that is **absent**, which is `bootstrap` on exit `0` — an
adopting repo has not written one yet, and refusing there would leave a fresh repo unable
to run the skill at all, on the same reasoning that makes an empty decision corpus answer `0001`
rather than refuse. Present-and-empty and absent are different facts and never share a code.

**Two defect classes this verb deliberately does not report**, because each is already decided by a
merge-blocking gate and a second answer could contradict it: **machine-local paths** in the register
(`leak-guard scan`, on `pull_request` and `merge_group`) and **dead internal links**
(`doc-links`, `lychee --offline` repo-wide, fail-closed on zero scope). The skill states the
expectation that those gates hold; it does not recompute their verdicts.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `0` | an outcome token was produced on stdout |
| `4` | a selected register was read and has no parseable term table |
| `7` | a selected register is present and holds zero rows — refusing to report a clean scan of nothing |
| `10` | `--register` carried a value off its closed enum |
| `11` | a selected register, or `.fabrika.jsonc`, could not be read, so the outcome is UNKNOWN |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `glossary check: cannot read <path>: <reason> — the outcome is UNKNOWN, never "clean".` | 11 | refusal |
| `glossary check: <path> has no parseable term table (<reason>) — the outcome is UNKNOWN.` | 4 | refusal |
| `glossary check: <path> holds 0 rows — refusing to report a clean scan of an empty register.` | 7 | refusal |
| `glossary check: --register "<value>" is not one of terms, language, both.` | 10 | usage error |

**Examples**

Both the register and the decision corpus are committed fixtures in this skill's tree, so every
printed byte reproduces — including the record ids below, which are that fixture corpus's own and
not a live repository's:

```
$ fabrika glossary check --register terms --dir packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/registers --decisions packages/fabrika-cli/test-fixtures/glossary/decisions
defects
duplicate-key	terms	Products (domains)	pano	also declared in "Core / shape"
citation-superseded	terms	Core / shape	worker	cites 0044, status "superseded by [0144](0144-depo-internal-asset-store.md)"
$ echo $?
0
```

The fixture register plants exactly those two defects: `pano` is declared under both `Core / shape`
and `Products (domains)`, and the `worker` row cites `0044`, whose fixture record carries a
superseded status line. `depo` and `sozluk` are clean rows, so the finding list is the whole verdict
rather than a truncation.

```
$ fabrika glossary check --register terms --dir /tmp/fresh-repo/.glossary
bootstrap
$ echo $?
0
```

**Grounding**

- **A judging verb reds on zero scope**; exit `7` is that rule for a register that exists and holds
  nothing. The absent-file carve-out follows the same reasoning that keeps a legitimately empty
  decision corpus from leaving an adopting repo unable to mint its first record.
- **v1's sweep exited non-zero on its own informative case**, so a caller read a produced answer as
  a failure. All three outcomes here exit `0`.
- **A row lands only after its coining decision is on the default branch**, and decision numbers are
  not stable before merge — three lanes have derived one id at once. `citation-dead` is how a row
  that jumped the gun is found afterwards.
- **A row can go stale against a superseding decision with nothing detecting it**;
  `citation-superseded` is that detection.
- **One term, one register, one row.** `cross-register` is that rule made mechanical.
- The leak and link carve-outs are the interface convention's rule 6 consequence — where a question is
  already enforced, state the expectation and leave the verdict where it is enforced.
