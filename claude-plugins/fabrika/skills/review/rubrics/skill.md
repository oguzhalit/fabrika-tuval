# Skill rubric — the `review-skill` namespace

Applied to every skill-class file the diff touches (SKILL.md files, rubric/reference files beside
them, contract specs, agent definitions), each read whole rather than by hunk, because the document
is the contract its reader executes. A `contract.md` is the one exception and stays a
heading-at-a-time read. So the unit for a contradiction finding is the touched file, not the diff's
slice of it; [`review` §3](../SKILL.md) states how that read runs, the contract carve included, and
why every contradiction one file holds lands in one round's verdict. These are the checks no other
surface's rubric structurally makes (v1's rigor checks 1–3; rigor check 4 — gate-invariant
preservation — is the `governance` skill's, never graded here).

## 1 — Behavioral correctness

Walk the skill's instructions as the executor would: every step is executable as written, every
completion criterion is checkable, every fence is a plain literal **in the string the agent
executes** (no shell-expanded `$VAR`, no default expansion, no `..` climb — the isolation verifier
is syntactic and refuses them), and every verb the text invokes exists in the contract beside it,
same spelling, same flags. An instruction the model cannot carry out, or a state word the contract
never prints, is a finding. So is one file answering the same question two ways: a rule the change
retired, left standing three lines from the rule replacing it, is what the executor meets first, and
the round that reads the file owns that finding however far outside a hunk the stale line sits.

A `$<name>` that the skill declares in its own `arguments:` frontmatter is **not** a finding: the
harness substitutes it textually before the body reaches the agent, so the verifier never sees it
([skill-conventions §4](../../../docs/skill-conventions.md#4-the-invocation-surface-is-a-plain-literal)).
A `$<name>` in a fence with no matching `arguments:` entry still is one.

## 2 — Trigger and description quality

The frontmatter description is the routing surface: it states what the skill does AND when to
fire it, discriminates against its nearest sibling, and names its non-scopes. A description that
under-claims never fires; one that over-claims shadows a sibling. Judge it against the corpus
that exists, not in isolation.

## 3 — Cross-skill conflict and shadowing

Grep the live skill roster for overlapping triggers and duplicated responsibilities. Two skills
answering the same phrase is a routing coin-flip; a new skill quietly absorbing a sibling's lane
is a finding even when each file reads well alone.

## 4 — fabrika conventions (skills under `claude-plugins/fabrika/`)

Hold the skill to `claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/skill-conventions.md` — the two-layer split (a
deterministic step in prose belongs in a verb), sizing as the routing/depth split rather than a
line count — a `SKILL.md` that inlines what its `contract.md` owns is over-long however few lines it
is, and shortness reached by deleting judgement is not conformance — single-home facts,
closed-vocabulary coordination, declared ingestion surface
and capability set — and its contract to `cli-interface-convention.md` Part 2's completeness
test. A restated sibling behavior (rather than an imported module or a cited section) is drift
waiting to happen; name it.

**No step, rationale or exit-code note may point at something only this repo can resolve.** Run
`fabrika guard portability-guard check --sha <head>` at the head you scoped, on any diff under
`claude-plugins/fabrika/` or `packages/fabrika-cli/src/`, and take a red as a finding: a skill
installed elsewhere whose refusal rationale names a ticket the reader cannot open teaches nothing,
and the fix is a self-contained sentence, not a shorter pointer. The guard's floor only shrinks, so a diff that lifts a ceiling to
admit a new reference is the finding rather than the remedy. Skill text gets no exception: the
`@ruling` citation tag the guard admits is scoped to `packages/fabrika-cli/`, because a skill's
reader is the adopter's agent and a link into this repo's history teaches that agent nothing.

**Every contract read the diff instructs is a section read** — a contract is a reference the reader
resolves one heading at a time, never a document loaded whole. Skill text and any
spawn prompt in the diff point at
`fabrika wire doc-section --heading "…" < <skill-base>/contract.md`; text telling an agent to read,
open, or load a `contract.md` whole is a finding, whatever the read's shape.

**A closing message written for a person is held to
[skill-conventions §15](../../../docs/skill-conventions.md#a-closing-message-ends-in-two-plain-lines).**
Where a skill-class file tells an agent to write a closing message, a stop note or a final report a
person reads, the text must require that section's two plain lines on every way the run can end,
link to the section for how a pipeline word is handled, and leave the terminal token unchanged below
them. A miss is a finding, and it refuses PASS on the `review-skill` namespace: an ending the step
leaves out, a bare exit code offered as the explanation, or the section's word list restated in
place of the link. This check reads the skill's text, never the message an agent wrote on a given
run.

## 5 — Writing craft

Apply [`writing-for-agents`](../../writing-for-agents/SKILL.md) verbatim to each skill-class file
the diff touches, over the whole file as the header says, and state its verdict here.
`claude-plugins/fabrika/docs/skill-conventions.md` §8 gate 1 admits a skill only when it is written
under that discipline, and the gate reads the text rather than the
session that produced it, so this section is where the gate acquires teeth. Read the skill inline as
a reference; it has no run to spawn.

Name what it catches: a step whose completion criterion nothing can check, reference that buries the
steps around it, one meaning kept in two homes, a sentence that changes no behaviour against the
model's default, a rule steered by prohibition where the positive target would land harder. An unmet
line is a finding, and a finding here refuses PASS on the `review-skill` namespace on the same
footing as one from sections 1–4.
