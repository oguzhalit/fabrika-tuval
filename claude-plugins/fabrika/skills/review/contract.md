# `/review` — derived CLI contract

**Skill:** [`review`](SKILL.md) · **Date:** 2026-08-08

These verbs live in `packages/fabrika-cli/`, binary `fabrika`, grouped under a `review`
subcommand, beside the `adr`, `report`, `triage` and `wire` groups already implemented
there. The [CLI interface convention](../../docs/cli-interface-convention.md) governs them; where
this spec and that doc disagree, the doc wins and this spec is the bug.

**`fabrika` calls the retired v1 pipeline CLI nowhere, and neither does the skill.** Every verb
below is implemented from scratch. v1's four review gates and their scripts were read for
their semantics and their scars — each Grounding section names what the v1 counterpart gets wrong
and what this spec does instead — but no clause defers to one, and none is invoked.

**Substrate.** Effect CLI verbs on the `@effect/platform-node` seam the sibling groups use;
GitHub access per
[skill conventions §11, "GitHub access is REST, never GraphQL"](../../docs/skill-conventions.md).
Named because a spec that leaves the substrate open makes the implementer guess.

## Verb inventory

| Verb | Purpose | Split test |
|---|---|---|
| `review scope` | the PR's head SHA, linked issue, artifact-class partition of its changed files, the namespace set that partition requires and which of those are routed to another gate, the `self` / `harness` flags, and whether the diff requires the `governance` namespace | partitioning paths against a fixed class map, deriving the merge gate's own required set from it, and failing closed on an empty file list is mechanical; what to do with each class is judgment |
| `review diff` | the PR's diff bytes, with truncation refused rather than silently passed through | fetching and proving completeness is mechanical; reading the diff is the whole judgment layer |
| `review criteria` | the set the review grades: the linked issue's acceptance-criteria block through the registered `acceptance-criteria` wire format, plus every standing ruling on that issue through the registered `decision-ruling` one, folded into one sourced list | fetch + registered parse + checkbox states + the roster-gated marker scan are mechanical; grading a criterion or a ruling is judgment |
| `review ci` | the live CI check-run rollup at a head, fail-closed on incomplete enumeration | classifying check runs and proving the enumeration complete is mechanical; weighing a red check is judgment |
| `review verdicts` | every verdict marker on the PR, per namespace, each with its `Current` / `Stale` / `Unbindable` binding against the live head and the content it bound | comment sweep + registered parse + `bindToContent` is mechanical; what a stale marker means for this round is judgment |
| `review deviations` | the PR body's `## Deviations` section state (found / absent / malformed), its entries, and the Tier-M token scan over the diff | section detection and token scanning are mechanical; matching entry *substance* against findings is judgment (Tier R) |
| `review report` | the PR body's `## Report` section state (found / absent / malformed) and, on `found`, the author's text under it | section detection is mechanical; whether a criterion asks for a report, and whether the text answers it, is judgment |
| `review post` | the single sanctioned verdict emit: compose through the `verdict-marker` wire format, bind to the inspected head at post time, post one comment per namespace at that head, read it back | marker composition, head re-resolution, leak scan and read-back are a protocol; the polarity and clause are judgment |
| `review append-criterion` | append one reviewer-authored acceptance criterion to the linked issue under the four fences (append-only · ACL-gated fail-closed · frozen at `src/retry-budget.ts`'s `CAP_ROUND`), with a provenance tag naming the PR or, on an epic child, the range | the fences and the diff-guarded append are mechanical; whether a finding is in-scope is judgment |
| `review scratch` | the per-lane directory this reviewer's staged files go under, allocated fail-closed | deriving a namespace no second lane resolves to, and refusing when it cannot be derived, is mechanical; what to stage there is judgment |
| `review seat` | this worktree checked out at an epic child's range tip, read back off git, or a refusal naming the range it cannot reach | resolving the child's local branch, proving it carries the tip and checking out is mechanical; what the seated tree then says is judgment |

### Considered and deliberately not derived

Each is a real proposal someone could make again. (Conventions §7 homes these in a plugin-root
`.out-of-scope/`, which no fabrika skill has bootstrapped yet; until it exists they live inline,
the same tracked debt the sibling contracts carry.)

- **A typecheck / lint / test execution verb, or any head worktree.** Typecheck, lint, unit
  tests, secret scan, leak scan and unresolved-thread accounting are required CI gates in the
  repo's own workflows. A fabrika copy could only agree redundantly or contradict an
  enforced verdict, and a local re-run has returned another checkout's cached green three times
  in one session. v1 made the in-tree typecheck authoritative; that
  posture is **deliberately not carried** — the scope rule ("no second answer to
  anything a CI gate already enforces") supersedes it for fabrika, and `review ci` is the
  structural read of the same facts. Dropping the worktree also removes two whole classes by
  construction — a shared-`/tmp` collision between lanes, and a fixed-name scratch file two lanes
  both write — and closes the self-review instruction
  hole without a denylist: a head that is never checked out is a head whose instructions are
  never loaded. **The commit binding does not reverse this**: `review scope`,
  `review diff`, `review deviations` and `review post`'s namespace recompute fetch the PR head
  and read the artifact out of the **object database**
  (`git diff <base>...<head>`), which writes objects and no working tree. Nothing is checked out,
  so no head instruction file is ever on disk to be loaded — a diff that adds a worktree or a
  checkout is still the wrong fix and should be red at review. The one fence a reviewer runs over
  files holds the same line: `guard portability-guard check --sha <head>` reads the head's files
  out of the object database rather than walking the reviewer's worktree, which was cut from
  another checkout and never holds the head. It refuses on `11` when the head is not in the clone,
  and never falls back to the tree.

  **`review seat` is the one checkout this group performs, and it is narrower than the posture it
  looks like it reverses.** It executes nothing and judges nothing: it moves the reviewer's *own*
  worktree onto the commit its verdict already names, on an epic child, where the fences that read
  the working tree are the child review's by design and the child's branch is local to the tree that
  built it. It cuts no worktree of its own — so the `/tmp` collision and the fixed-name scratch file
  both stay unconstructible — and it never checks out a pull request's head, which is the surface the
  self-review hole lives on. What it does put on disk is the child's range as its own run built it,
  and **no `self` fence governs that read** — `self` is computed by `review scope`, which resolves a
  pull request's head and has no range form, so an epic child's review never derives that flag at
  all. What holds instead is narrower and mechanical: a checkout mid-run auto-loads no instruction
  file, and the shell judges by the rubric text its spawn preloaded, so moving the tree cannot change
  which rules the reviewer applies. That is the whole control on this path; it is not the `self`
  fence, and a later narrowing may not cite one here.
- **A dead-link / decision-index / skill-frontmatter checker.** The repo's own CI jobs already
  gate each. The rubrics state the expectation; the verdict stays where it is enforced.
- **A control-plane classifier.** `fabrika ship scope` routes §CP membership and CODEOWNERS enforces it
  at merge; a second opinion here has cost a round before. `review post` takes the carrier as an
  **input** (`--carrier advisory`); it never computes the §CP verdict.
- **A `review trivial` verb or namespace.** Triviality is a *mode* of the skill by founder ruling:
  it changes which judgment runs, not which namespaces are emitted, and v1's
  `review-trivial` already proved the mode needs no fourth namespace. Nothing mechanical is left
  once the fan-out is skipped.
- **A second parser for the AC block, the ruling marker or the verdict marker.** All three are
  registered wire formats (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/registry.ts`); `review criteria` and
  `review post` / `review verdicts` import `read` / `emit` from `acceptance-criteria.ts`,
  `decision-ruling.ts` and `verdict-marker.ts`. A hand-rolled marker regex is the incident the
  registry landed to end, and the drift with it.
- **A second ruling format beside `decision-ruled`.** The read widened past `type:decision` rather
  than minting a sibling key: one walk, one author gate, one scan, and every marker already on the
  board keeps reading. A parallel mechanism would be two gates disagreeing about one comment.
- **A second reading of who may rule.** The roster is `packages/fabrika-cli/src/ship/roster.ts`, the
  same one the merge gate enforces and `decision rule` resolves at write time.
- **A governance sweep.** The ADR contradiction sweep and gate-invariant preservation (v1
  `review-doc`'s sweep, `review-skill`'s rigor check 4) are the `governance` skill's, guarding
  from outside. The skill invokes it at the seam; this group computes nothing for it.

### Nothing here recomputes an enforced answer

Every question this group answers is ungated today. The enforced ones — typecheck/lint/tests,
leaks, secrets, dead links, decision-index integrity, skill frontmatter validity, thread
accounting, §CP membership — each have a CI job or a merge rule that owns them, and this spec
computes no second verdict on any of them.

### The name situation

No v1 skill is named bare `review`, so this skill has no direct name collision — unlike
`/triage` and `/report`. The four v1 gates (`review-code`, `review-doc`, `review-skill`,
`review-trivial`) remain live project-level skills until the cutover, which is separate, later
work; until then nothing on `main` routes to this skill and it is reached as `/fabrika:review`.
The routing gap is recorded in the authoring PR rather than patched from here.

## Shared conventions

Stated once rather than repeated per block.

- **Answer channel: machine.** Stdout carries the answer and nothing else; scope lines, refusal
  reasons and progress go to stderr. Every "nothing found" case prints a state word — empty
  stdout is byte-identical to a verb that never ran, and v1's callers consumed exactly that as a
  proven negative — an else-less classifier, and a zero-file probe that still answered "has code".
- **Common inputs.** `--repo <owner/name>` (default: `$CLAUDE_PIPELINE_REPO`, else
  `$GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, else the `origin` remote; none resolvable → exit 1 — the resolution
  chain the shipped `report`/`triage` groups already use, inherited for one config surface
  rather than a second vocabulary). `--json` swaps the line grammar for one object with the
  named keys.
- **Every list read paginates and reports its scanned count** on stderr — comments, check runs,
  changed files. A verdict driven by a silently truncated read is a verdict over unknown scope
  — the pagination-honesty rule, applied group-wide.
- **A non-zero exit is UNKNOWN.** No verb prints a partial or permissive answer on a non-zero
  exit (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/verb.ts`'s answer-channel rule).

### The shared exit taxonomy

All nine verbs allocate from one internal table, so a code means one thing across *this group*.
Repo-wide the same number does not — `wire`'s `3`–`8` are its own — but where this group's codes overlap
**`report`'s and `triage`'s writing verbs** (`3`, `5`, `6`,
`7`, `8`, `9`, `11`) they match them deliberately, code for code, read from the **shipped
package** (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/codes.ts`, `src/triage/codes.ts`), never from a
sibling contract.md — a checked-in contract can lag the binary it describes, which is exactly why
prose copies are not the authority.

| Code | Meaning | scope | diff | criteria | ci | verdicts | deviations | post | append-criterion |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `0` | the answer is on stdout | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

| `126` | no implementation could be resolved | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing | — | — | — | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `4` | *(deliberate gap — kept as the body-section seat `report file` uses; no verb here performs one)* | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| `5` | the **authored** text carries a machine-local path | — | — | — | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `6` | the **authored** text is a bare `@` path reference — not redactable | — | — | — | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |

| `11` | a **precondition read failed** — nothing was written and the outcome is UNKNOWN | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

| `13` | refused: the read was completed but its scope is **provably incomplete** — a truncated file list or diff, a check-run enumeration short of `total_count` | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |

| `16` | refused: the enumeration is complete and **no gate inspected the bytes** — the rollup is not `red`, yet no workflow this repo authors inspected the head, because every repo-authored run here carries another commit or ran against another ref, so a `green` would report coverage that does not exist | — | — | — | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| `17` | refused: the write would retire a standing verdict of the **opposite polarity** at this head and `--supersede` was not passed — nothing written | — | — | — | — | — | — | ✓ | — |
| `18` | refused: a `PASS` is the terminal of the round that appended an acceptance criterion tagged for that same subject and round — the row binds the next cycle, and a `PASS` has none, so the round owes a `FAIL`; nothing written | — | — | — | — | — | — | ✓ | — |
| `19` | refused: a `PASS` whose linked contract marks a criterion's evidence as living outside the diff, and whose body names no evidence for it — a marked criterion is graded on the evidence it names, never on the diff alone, so a `PASS` citing none graded it on nothing; nothing written | — | — | — | — | — | — | ✓ | — |
| `127` | the verb never ran (unresolved binary) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**This matrix owns what a code *means*; the per-verb tables own what *triggers* it.** Every verb
can return `0`, `1`, `126` and `127` with the meanings above, stated here and nowhere else; the
per-verb "Exit status" tables enumerate only that verb's own proven outcomes, `3` and up, phrased
as that verb's trigger. (The one-fact-one-home rule; the `/triage` contract already shipped the
ten-places drift this prevents.)

**`11` is the shipped `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN`** (`report/codes.ts`), matched rather than
reinvented: a read the verb needed failed, so nothing is proven — not `7` (which is *proven*
absence: a 404 is a fact about the repository, an unreachable GitHub is not a fact about
anything) and not `1` (which would fuse an unreachable GitHub with a bad flag).

**`12` and `13` are this group's own proven refusals**, in the band `triage` used for its
kill-guards. `12` is the stale-head refusal — the one code whose absence would let a verdict
formed over one tree land on another. It seats at both ends of a review:
at the emit seam (`review post`, where the live head has moved past the judged one) and at the
read seam (`review scope` / `review diff`, where a `--sha` that is not the PR's head would have
a human spend a review on a tree the PR has left). `13` is the
incomplete-enumeration refusal: the read *succeeded* and is *provably short* — a diff carrying
fewer files than the PR declares, a check-run page count below `total_count` — which is neither
`11` (nothing failed) nor `7` (scope exists; it just was not all seen). Folding `13` into either would render a
half-seen PR as a fully-judged one — the same class as a gate PASSing while its whole evidence
upload failed, or a zero-file probe answering "has code".

**`5` and `6` apply only to text the caller just wrote** (a verdict body, an appended
criterion) — authored text is refusable because the author can fix it. Their fixes are opposite
(redact-and-resend vs send-the-bytes), which is why they stay two codes, exactly as in `report`.

### The read verbs bind to a commit before they read

`review scope`, `review diff` and `review deviations` serve the artifact a whole review is formed
over, so **the bytes have to come from a named commit, not from an endpoint that takes a
pull-request number and no commit at all.** The platform's PR reads are the second thing: a push
landing between scoping and reading serves the *new* head's artifact under the *old* head's SHA,
and the result is a well-formed, confident verdict over code nobody judged. `review post`'s `12`
cannot close that — it fires after the judging, and a rewind that lands back on the recorded SHA
passes it clean. So `review post` binds too, at the one read that is not the head re-resolve: the
file list its derived namespace set comes from.

The three read verbs therefore take an optional `--sha`, `review post` binds to the `--sha` it
already requires, and all four run one shared binding step
(`packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/head.ts`) before any artifact read:

1. An explicit `--sha` must be **the PR's head**, or the verb refuses on `12`. Malformed is `10`.
2. A configured git remote in this checkout must serve the target repo, `pull/<pr>/head` must
   fetch, the commit must resolve in the **object database**, and `git rev-parse` must resolve it
   to *itself* — a local ref or tag spelled as hex resolves elsewhere, which is how a name that
   verifies still names the wrong tree. The base ref must resolve too, since a diff is a range,
   **and so must the merge base of that branch tip and this head** — the binding carries the tip
   and the branch point as two separate values, and every verb's `base` is the branch point.
   Any of these unmet is `11`, naming what is UNKNOWN. There is no permissive fallback to
   the PR-number endpoints: unbindable is a refusal, never a plausible value.
3. The artifact is then read with `git diff <base>...<head>`, where `<base>` is that branch point
   — bytes for `review diff` and `review deviations`'s Tier-M scan, the `--name-only -z` path list
   for `review scope` and `review post`'s namespace recompute — under flags that pin the output to
   the two commits rather than to the invoking user's own git configuration (`--no-ext-diff`,
   explicit `a/`/`b/` prefixes).

Every one of them prints the bound commit and its base on stderr, and `review scope`'s `scoped`
line prints **the commit it read the files out of**, so the head named and the files partitioned
are never two different trees.

**`review post` binds underneath its `12`, not instead of it.** The stale-head refusal stays this
verb's first step and keeps its own message: `12` is what says the verdict's tree is gone. The
binding is what makes the namespace set provably the bound tree's — a separate property, since a
force-push that rewinds back onto `--sha` passes `12` clean while the PR-number file endpoint
still answers with some other head's list.

**Nothing is checked out.** A fetch writes objects, not a working tree, so this binding and the
no-head-worktree decision above hold together rather than trading off.

### Read-backs compare normalized text, not bytes

Every write verb re-reads its target and compares through **`normalizeForReadback` from
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/compose.ts`** — import it; its third step (strip trailing
newlines) is the one a re-derivation drops, and dropping it fires exit `9` on clean runs.

### Machine-local path detection

`review post` and `review append-criterion` share the leak predicate **already implemented** at
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/leaks.ts` — import it, never re-derive it. A verdict body that
must *cite* a leak found in the diff cites it by class root or repo-relative form; the refusal
message says so — review prose quoting a leak has tripped this guard on itself. `review scratch`'s
answer is a path under one of those roots, so a verdict quoting where the diff was staged reds on
`5` — the same refusal `build pr` and `build note` make.

## Review content filtering

Filtering is opt-in for `review scope` and `review diff`: `--filter-placement=after` enables it;
omitting the flag preserves unfiltered output. `before` and every other value refuse on `10`.
`--exclude` adds comma-separated patterns only when filtering is enabled. Patterns support `*`
within a path segment and `**` across segments; every other character, including `?`, is literal.
The shipped defaults are `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `**/__snapshots__/**`, `**/__generated__/**`,
`**/schema.graphql.generated` and `**/__mutation__/**`: the lockfile, snapshot directories and the
generated-schema and build-output shapes.
The effective set is shipped defaults minus `reviewFilterUnexclude`, then `reviewFilterExclusions`
and caller additions, deduplicated by pattern in declaration order. Re-adding a removed default
restores it and removes it from the removal report.

Required classes, namespaces and subsystem constraints always derive from the complete raw path
list. Filtering changes delivered contents only. Pattern checks and the runtime check of actually
excluded paths refuse hiding governed content on `21`. Guards continue reading raw paths.

Completeness is proved before filtering. A complete nonempty raw diff may deliberately serve zero
sections, with every excluded path reported; that result retains all required reviews. It is not a
verdict and does not establish acceptance criteria. An empty or incomplete raw read retains its
existing refusal. The reviewer follows the filtered-content instructions in `SKILL.md`.

Worked cases:

- A lockfile-only diff with filtering enabled reports `review-code`, one excluded path and zero
  served sections. The same call without placement serves the original content.
- A mixed code/doc diff excluding its code content retains both required text reviews.
- A configured UI path still requires `review-ui`; a governed path still requires governance and
  cannot be excluded. Preview and scope report the same required set.
- A literal `?` pattern matches that filename only, without throwing or acting as a quantifier.

## `review scope`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika review scope 4321 [--sha <head>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json] [--filter-placement=after] [--exclude <patterns>]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number to scope |
| `--sha` | string | no | the PR's live head | the head to read the changed files at; see the binding step above |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

Filtering options follow [Review content filtering](#review-content-filtering).
Between class and namespace rows, each matching subsystem emits `subsystem\t<name>\t<count>`,
`subsystem-note\t<name>\t<constraint>` and sorted `subsystem-path\t<name>\t<path>` rows.
Subsystems sort by name; a file may match several. JSON adds `subsystems` entries with
`{name, files, paths, constraint}` only when matches exist.
When filtering is enabled, the output ends with `excluded\t<count>` and `excluded-path\t<path>`
rows, then `un-excluded\t<count>` and `un-excluded-path\t<pattern>` for removed defaults when
any remain removed. JSON adds `filter_placement`, `excluded: {count, paths}` and, when nonempty,
`unexcluded: {count, paths}`. Classes and `scanned` continue counting all raw paths.

**Output** — machine channel, in this line order. First line:
`scoped\t<head-sha>\t<fixes:n|part-of:n|->`, where the head is the commit the file list was actually
read out of and the third field is the issue reference — the same token `ship scope` prints. Then one
line per present class — `class\t<name>\t<file-count>` where `<name>` is one of `code`, `doc`,
`skill`, `ui`. Then one `namespace\t<ns>` line per namespace the diff requires, then one
`routed\t<ns>` line per required namespace this gate may not emit — a subset of the `namespace` rows,
re-printed rather than removed. Then two flag lines `self\t<true|false>` and
`harness\t<true|false>`, then `governance\t<required|not-required>`.

With `--json`, an object with keys `outcome`, `head` (full 40-hex), `issue` (an object
`{kind, number}` where `kind` is `fixes` / `part-of` / `none` and `number` is an integer, or `null`
on `none`), `classes` (array of `{name, files}`), `self` (boolean), `harness` (boolean), `governance`
(the string `required` or `not-required`), `scanned`
(changed files seen), `namespaces` (array — the required set, e.g. `["review-code","review-doc"]`),
and `routed` (array — the subset of `namespaces` routed to another gate).

**The required set is `ship scope`'s own.** Both verbs call one pair of functions over one file list
(`partitionWithUi` + `shipNamespacesOf` in
[`packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/classes.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/classes.ts)),
so they cannot report different sets for the same diff. That is why `ui` is a class here at all: the
reviewer's set was short one namespace and the merge gate refused, once per rendered-surface PR
once. `self` and `harness` still come off the three-class partition.

**`routed` is what the wider set costs, and it costs nothing else.** Today the one routed namespace
is `review-ui`: `review` derives it, prints it, and still may not emit it — `review post`'s fence is
the three text classes, unchanged. `governance` is never routed; it is derived-required and fired
inside the review run, every round. What a reviewer does with a `routed` row is `SKILL.md` §1's, not
this verb's.

**The class map is a fixed path partition, stated here so two runs cannot disagree:**

| Class | Paths |
|---|---|
| `skill` | `claude-plugins/**` (SKILL.md, rubric/reference files, contract specs), `.claude/**` agent and skill definitions, `skills/**`, and any file named `SKILL.md` wherever it sits — the last two rows are what keep the map honest on a repo that homes its skills elsewhere (found live by an eval run: a toy repo's `skills/deploy-notes/SKILL.md` partitioned to `doc` under the first two rows alone) |
| `doc` | `*.md` outside `claude-plugins/**` — the repo's decision, pattern, glossary and report directories, its `README` and contributor docs, and any other docs directory |
| `code` | everything else — source, tests, config, workflows, manifests |
| `ui` | a rendered surface of the repo's own app source — an **overlay**, not a fourth bucket: such a file is `code` as well, and is counted in both rows. It is the only class a file can hold beside another, which is why the row counts can exceed `scanned` |

Every changed file maps to exactly one class of the first three, `code` the residual — a file the map cannot place
is `code`, never dropped, because an unclassified file silently excluded from every rubric is a
review that never saw it. `self` is true when any changed path is under
`claude-plugins/fabrika/skills/review/`. `harness` is true when any changed path is under
exactly `.claude/`, `.github/`, or `claude-plugins/` — this repo's governance surface, a closed
three-root list of its own. The class map's two portability rows (`skills/**`, any `SKILL.md`)
deliberately do **not** set it: they classify a foreign repo's skill text for the rubric, while
`harness` marks *this* harness. The *decision* of what governance does with the flag belongs to
the `governance` skill; the flag only makes the seam mechanical.

**`governance` is a fourth-root answer, and it is why `harness` must not be read as one.** The line
is `touchesGovernanceRoot` over the same file list, against the **declared** governance roots
(`governedRoots`, whose shipped value is four roots: the decision corpus, `.claude/`, `.github/` and
`.fabrika.jsonc` itself — a repo that governs its own plugin tree declares it) — the
one derivation `governance scope` prints, imported rather than recomputed. So a
decision-corpus-only diff prints `harness\tfalse` and `governance\trequired`, which is exactly the
pair a reviewer keying the governance obligation off `harness` gets wrong: a clean PASS,
then the ship gate blocking on `ns governance absent` with nobody told to fill it. The token
vocabulary matches `governance scope`'s on purpose — one word, read the same in both places.

**The config the classes derive over is the PR's, never this checkout's.** `governedRoots`,
`uiSurfaces` and `reviewSubsystems` are read out of git at the bound head and at its merge base, the
same two commits the file list is read between. A path counts as governed, raises `ui`, or carries a
subsystem constraint when **either** commit's `.fabrika.jsonc` says so: head alone would let a PR
drop its own row and skip the gate, base alone would miss a PR that adds an app. A file absent at
one commit is that commit's shipped defaults; one that does not decode, or a read that fails, is
`11` naming the commit. Every verb that derives a PR's classes over a bound head — `ship scope`,
`ship gate`, `ship floor`, `lane prove`, `heal-ci`, `governance scope` and `post`, `review preview`,
`review-ui route` — reads through the same reader (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/class-config.ts`),
so the tree a verb stands in cannot change its answer. The filter keys stay the checkout's.

**The issue reference** is resolved from the PR body in two passes, and the kinds are reported
apart rather than collapsed. First the closing keywords (`Fixes/Closes/Resolves #N`), first match
⇒ `fixes:<n>`; failing that, an explicit `Part of #N` ⇒ `part-of:<n>`; failing both, `-` /
`{kind: "none"}`. The second pass exists because `build --partial` emits `Part of #N` **by
contract**, so a partial-split PR this gate must grade was reported issueless while `ship scope`
called the same body linked. Both kinds name the issue whose acceptance criteria bind the
PR; only `fixes` auto-closes it on merge, which is why the kinds stay distinct. This derivation is
shared code with `ship scope` (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/classes.ts`) — one definition, two
verbs — and it does not widen `linkedIssueOf`, which stays closing-keyword-only.

`none` is a fact, not a verdict: what a genuinely issueless PR means is the skill's decision, and
the skill states it (`SKILL.md` step 2).

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404), or closed, or has **zero changed files** — a review over nothing, refused fail-closed |
| `10` | `--sha` is not a head SHA |
| `11` | the PR could not be read, the commit could not be bound, or `.fabrika.jsonc` at the head or the merge base could not be read or decoded — the scope is UNKNOWN |
| `12` | `--sha` is not the PR's head — re-scope at the head, never partition a tree the PR has left |
| `13` | git reports no changed files for the bound commit's range — an empty read, with nothing to partition |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|

| `review scope: PR #<n> is closed — nothing to review.` | 7 | refusal |

| `review scope: git reports no changed files for the range <base>...<sha>, so <sha> has nothing to partition — refusing to scope an empty read (#3999).` | 13 | refusal |

**Scope** — one PR's metadata, and the path list git reports for one bound commit's range. That
list is the scope itself, so it has no second count to be checked against: it is refused when
**empty**, and GitHub's declared changed-file count is reported beside it as a cross-check that
never refuses. The class partition is total over what was read; the refusals exist so it is never
run over less than everything, and never over a different tree than the head it prints.

**Examples**
```
$ fabrika review scope 4321
scoped	03135b91aa04f7e2c9d8b1640a5c22e9f01b7d3c	fixes:4287
class	code	3
class	doc	1
namespace	review-code
namespace	review-doc
self	false
harness	false
governance	not-required
```

A rendered surface raises `ui` beside `code`, and its namespace comes back on a `routed` row:

```
$ fabrika review scope 4322
scoped	6f7b834bcf1cf16fc465389d8f45cc21bd23a3fe	part-of:5434

```

**Grounding**

- **A zero-file read that still answered.** v1's class probe read 0 files and silently classified
  the PR as carrying code, exit 0; the zero-file case here is a `7` refusal.
- **One namespace filled on a mixed diff.** `namespaces` is printed as a set precisely so the
  emission checklist is machine-derived, not remembered. It is that set minus the `routed` rows.
- **Two verbs deriving different required sets from one map**, so the reviewer PASSed one
  namespace short and the merge gate refused. `namespaces` and `routed` are that fix's output.
- v1's `classify-skills-only.sh` prints nothing on its code-PR branch and falls off the end (the
  S10 else-less classifier) — every outcome here is a token.
- **`self` is the input the skill's BASE-revision fence keys on** — a reviewer judging a diff that
  edits its own skill reads the base revision of that text, not the head's.
- **A partial split that read as issueless.** `ship scope` read `Part of #N` and this verb did not,
  so the shape `build --partial` emits by contract was linked to the shipper and issueless to the
  gate, leaving the acceptance-criteria step with no issue to grade.
- **The file list is the namespace set's only input**, and the set is both floor and ceiling:
  a list read at a later commit than the printed head derives a namespace nobody judged, or drops
  one. The list and the head are one commit or the verb refuses.
- **No second count of the range**, because the list it reads *is* the scope, and
  GitHub's `changed_files` cannot stand in for one: it is a different computation over its own merge
  base with its own rename pairing, which counts two files where git's list carries one path. So the
  disagreement is reported and never refused on, and the only short read git alone establishes — an
  empty one — is the `13`.

## `review diff`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika review diff 4321 [--sha <head>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--filter-placement=after] [--exclude <patterns>]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--sha` | string | no | the PR's live head | the head to read the diff at; see the binding step above |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |

Filtering options follow [Review content filtering](#review-content-filtering).
A filtered answer prefixes the kept unified-diff sections with
`x-fabrika-filter: placement=after excluded=N served=M`, then sorted
`x-fabrika-excluded-path: <path>` lines and sorted `x-fabrika-unexcluded-path: <pattern>` lines for
removed defaults. The header remains when M is zero. Counts describe complete file sections,
including quoted filenames decoded with the same parser as the raw completeness proof.

**Output** — machine channel. The unified diff bytes, read out of the object database at the bound
commit. There is no empty answer: a PR with zero changed files is `review scope`'s `7`, and this
verb reds the same way. No `--json`: the diff is the object.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404) or closed, or has zero changed files — the same refusal `review scope` makes, so neither verb serves a review over nothing |
| `10` | `--sha` is not a head SHA |
| `11` | the diff could not be read, or the commit could not be bound — UNKNOWN |
| `12` | `--sha` is not the PR's head — re-review at the head, never judge a tree the PR has left |
| `13` | the diff is provably incomplete — the file count in the diff at the bound commit is short of the file list git reports for the same range |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `review diff: PR #<n> not found in <repo>.` | 7 | refusal |
| `review diff: PR #<n> is closed — nothing to review.` | 7 | refusal |
| `review diff: PR #<n> has zero changed files — refusing to serve an empty diff as a reviewable one (ADR 0092).` | 7 | refusal |
| `review diff: --sha "<v>" is not a head SHA — expected 7–40 hex characters.` | 10 | refusal |
| `review diff: <what> — the artifact cannot be bound to a commit, so what it shows is UNKNOWN.` | 11 | refusal |
| `review diff: cannot read the diff for #<n> at <sha>: <reason> — UNKNOWN.` | 11 | refusal |
| `review diff: PR #<n>'s head is <live>, not <asked> — the tree you scoped is not the one under review; re-scope at <live> (ADR 0058).` | 12 | refusal |
| `review diff: the diff at <sha> carries <k> of the <m> files git reports for the same range <base>...<head> — both counts from git, so this diff is provably short; refusing to serve a partial diff as the whole (#3925's class).` | 13 | refusal |

**Scope** — one commit's diff, completeness-checked against the file list git reports for the same
range. The bound commit, the scanned byte and file counts, and GitHub's declared changed-file count
(reported as a cross-check, never refused on) go to stderr on the answer path.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika review diff 4321 | head -3
diff --git a/src/cart.ts b/src/cart.ts
index 0b1c2d3..a1b2c3d 100644
--- a/src/cart.ts
```

**Grounding**

- The `13` refusal is about a diff that arrives short, not about a platform that serves prefixes.
  `application/vnd.github.diff` does **not** truncate: over its limits it refuses with HTTP `406`
  and `errors[].code = "too_large"`, and under them it serves the diff whole — established by a
  live probe against the API, not assumed. This verb does not read that endpoint anyway; its bytes
  are local `git diff <base>...<head>` at the bound commit, and its denominator is a second read of
  that same range — `git diff --name-only -z`, one path per `diff --git` entry — so both counts come
  from git under one set of flags rather than from two systems. GitHub's declared
  `changed_files` is still read and reported beside them as a cross-check that never refuses; it is a
  third party's answer over its own merge base and its own rename detection. What `13` still buys is
  real: the served bytes can carry fewer files than git lists for that range, and serving that prefix
  as the whole PR is the blind-PASS class one layer down.
- State the guarantee at its real precision: the proof is a **cardinality** test, never an
  entry-identity one. It establishes that the scanned bytes carry at least as many entries as the
  `--name-only` read lists — not that the two reads name the same files, and not that the range is
  the right range. A fault that shortens both reads alike stays invisible to it.
- The proof counts whole files, so it does not see a diff cut inside the last file's hunks — every
  `diff --git` header is still present, and the count passes. That is a stated bound of the proof,
  not a failure mode defended against: no producer for that shape is known.
- The split test is honest: this verb is not a relay because its whole job is the completeness
  proof — v1's `pr-diff.sh` was the relay, and nothing checked what it served.
- **Completeness is not identity.** The proof says the read was not cut short; it says nothing
  about which commit the bytes came from. A verdict's whole value is that it binds a tree, so the
  bytes are read at a commit rather than stamped with one afterwards.

## `review preview`

Read one subject with `--filter-placement=after`: a PR number with optional `--sha`/`--repo`,
`--base` and `--tip`, or `--diff-file <path>`. Exactly one subject is required. Filtering options
follow [Review content filtering](#review-content-filtering). Omitted placement, `before`, conflicting
subjects/modifiers, or `--emit-diff` with `--json` refuse on `10`.

PR and range subjects read the object database and prove diff completeness against the same
range's path list before filtering, so a deliberate exclusion can never masquerade as a truncation. A local diff file has no range to verify; it reads bytes as
given through the filesystem service. An unreadable input or config refuses on `11`, a stale PR
head on `12`, a provably incomplete diff on `13`, and a governed exclusion on `21`.

The answer starts `preview\tafter`, then `matched\t<count>`, raw-derived class and namespace
rows, and excluded/removal rows in scope's grammar. For a PR or range subject, required namespaces
use the same governed roots and UI prefixes as scope, read at the subject's two commits. A
`--diff-file` subject has no commit to read, so it takes them from the checkout's `.fabrika.jsonc`.
`--json` returns `outcome: "previewed"`, `placement`,
`matched_paths`, `excluded: {count, paths}`, optional `unexcluded: {count, paths}`, `active_classes`,
`namespaces`, `filtered_diff_bytes` and `filtered_diff_lines`. `--emit-diff` returns the filtered
bytes in `review diff`'s grammar instead. No review verdict or network write is produced.

## `review criteria`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika review criteria 4287 [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the issue number carrying the acceptance-criteria block |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. First line: `criteria\t<count>` (the body rows). Second:
`rulings\t<count>`. Then one line per row of the graded set —
`<body|ruling>\t<open|checked|superseded>\t<text>`, with a fourth column carrying a body row's
outside-diff evidence source or a ruling row's comment URL. Body rows come first in block order,
ruling rows after them oldest first.

Both halves are registered reads and there is **no second parser** on either: the verb fetches the
issue body and hands it to `acceptance-criteria`'s `read`
(`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/acceptance-criteria.ts`), and it fetches the issue's comments and
hands each to `decision-ruling`'s (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/decision-ruling.ts`), through the
same roster-gated scan `decision ruling` answers from
(`packages/fabrika-cli/src/decision/standing-rulings.ts`). The fold of the two is
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/graded-set.ts`.

With `--json`: `{"outcome":"criteria","issue":<n>,"count":<n>,"marked":<n>,"rulings":<n>,"superseded":<n>,"disregarded":<n>,"unauthorized":<n>,"danglingSupersedes":[<n>…][,"unmarked":{…}],"criteria":[{"source":"body"|"ruling","state":"open"|"checked"|"superseded","text":…,"evidence":<source|null>,"ruling":<url|null>,"at":<stamp|null>,"supersedes":<n|null>}…]}`.

**The rulings half is why this verb is the gate's whole contract read.** A founder ruling arrives as
a comment, and a gate that read only the body graded a spec the founder had already moved: one PR
passed two independent reviews against ten criteria while three rulings sat on the issue
contradicting them. A ruling row carries the founder's own words, taken from the cited comment —
which is on this same issue, so no extra fetch — collapsed to one line; where that comment is gone,
the row carries its URL instead.

**The marker's grammar** is `decision-ruling`'s, written only by `fabrika decision rule`:

```
decision-ruled: #<n> @ <12 lowercase hex> · ruling:<issue-comment url> · [supersedes:<k> · ]<ISO-8601 Z>
```

The digest binds the issue body that was ruled on; the `ruling:` field names the comment the ruling
is written in, checked against this issue by the format's own read; `supersedes:<k>` is optional and
names the **1-based** body criterion this ruling replaces.

- **The author gate is the whole authority.** Posting a marker takes nothing but the ability to
  comment, and the digest is derivable by anyone who can read the body — so the read resolves the
  control-plane roster (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/ship/roster.ts`) and a conforming marker from an
  off-roster author is **not** a standing ruling. It is counted in `unauthorized`, never dropped:
  reporting it as "nobody ruled" tells the account that tried that it never did.
- **A drifted marker is counted in `disregarded`**, for the same reason.
- **The roster is resolved only where it can change the answer:** a conforming marker is standing
  there, or some comment carries no machine marker. On an issue whose every comment is a machine
  marker with no ruling among them, the ACL's three reads answer nothing and are not made.
- **An owner comment no marker records is listed, never graded and never a refusal.** A comment
  counts as unmarked when a control-plane roster account wrote it, it carries no fabrika machine
  marker, no standing ruling cites it, and its `updated_at` is newer than the newest standing
  ruling's stamp. With no standing ruling, every such comment on the issue counts. A machine marker
  is a line opening with a `<!-- fabrika…` or `<!-- ac:…` HTML comment, a first non-blank line
  opening with a hyphenated lowercase `<key>:`, or a conforming gate verdict
  (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/machine-marker.ts`); a `decision-ruled:` line is one only when it
  conforms. The count and each comment's URL print on stderr and, under `--json`, in `unmarked`.
  The exit code does not change. The list can hold agent prose: an agent's free-prose note posted
  under an owner's account is a roster comment with no marker, and no read of the bytes tells it
  from a person's.
- **`unmarked` is present only when it has something to say.** `{"state":"counted","count":<n>,
  "comments":[<url>…]}` when at least one such comment stands. `{"state":"unknown","reason":…}` when
  the roster did not resolve on an issue carrying no conforming marker: the rulings half is still
  proven empty there, so the verb answers `0`, and the unmarked half says unknown rather than zero.
  An absent key is the proven zero, so an issue with no such comment prints the bytes it printed
  before the key existed.
- **Superseding is declared, never inferred.** No verb can read a ruling's prose and judge which
  criterion it overturns, so the human recording it says. A `supersedes:<k>` naming a row the block
  does not have lands in `danglingSupersedes` and on stderr — the founder's statement about which row
  he replaced is reported rather than discarded.
- **Ruling versus ruling is ordering, not a flag.** Rows print oldest first with their stamps, and
  the gate's rule is that the newest wins where two contradict. Nothing marks an earlier ruling
  retired.

**A marked criterion is one the diff's bytes cannot settle either way**, and the marker names where
its proof lives — `[evidence: <source>]`, the grammar owned by the wire format and written at mint
time by `triage enrich`. Every marked row is also counted and quoted on stderr, so a reviewer
scanning diagnostics cannot miss that this contract has any. Grade each one on the evidence it
names and name that evidence in the verdict body: `review post` refuses a `PASS` that does not
(`19`).

The count is never `0`: the wire format holds a conforming block's criteria as a non-empty
array — a heading with zero checkbox rows reads `Malformed`, so "a gradeable contract with
nothing in it" is unrepresentable and lands on `7` like any other malformed block.

An issue's open/closed state is deliberately **not** a precondition here, asymmetric with
`review append-criterion` (which refuses a closed target): reading the contract off a closed
issue is a legitimate re-review case, while writing to one buries the row where nobody looks.
The state is reported on stderr as a notice so the caller sees it.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the issue is proven absent (404); **or** the body was read and the AC block is proven absent or malformed — reported with the wire distinction on stderr, never invented around |
| `11` | the issue could not be read — whether a block exists is UNKNOWN; **or** the issue's comments or the control-plane roster could not be read — the graded set is UNKNOWN, never the body alone |

**No new exit code.** The rulings half adds one more way to be UNKNOWN and it is the same fact `11`
already names: a read that did not complete. Reporting "no ruling stands" off a roster that did not
resolve is the fail-open direction this whole surface exists to close, one layer down.

**`Absent` and `Malformed` share `7` but never share a message.** Both are fail-closed refusals
of the same judgment ("there is no gradeable contract here"), and the skill's response to both is
the same routing (a finding about the issue, not licence to invent criteria) — but the stderr
names which, with the wire reason verbatim, because their *repairs* differ (write the block vs
fix the drift).

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `review criteria: issue #<n> not found in <repo>.` | 7 | refusal |
| `review criteria: #<n> carries no acceptance-criteria block — absent: <wire reason>. Grade nothing; the contract is missing.` | 7 | refusal |
| `review criteria: #<n>'s acceptance-criteria block is malformed: <wire reason> — a drifted heading is a defect to report, not "there were none".` | 7 | refusal |
| `review criteria: cannot read #<n> in <repo>: <reason> — whether a block exists is UNKNOWN.` | 11 | refusal |

**Scope** — one issue body, read as typed JSON (never `jq -r .body`, which errors on the control
characters GitHub bodies carry and yields empty in a loop).

```

**Grounding**

- The registry row names `review` as this format's consumer; this verb is that row discharged.
- The near-miss window (`NEAR_MISS_EDITS = 3`) is the format's own; a drifted heading reds as
  malformed here rather than reading as "no criteria" — the wire module's design carried to the
  fetch seam.

## `review ci`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika review ci 4321 [--sha <head>] [--wait] [--budget-seconds <n>] [--cadence-seconds <n>]
                       [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--sha` | string | no | the PR's live head | the head to enumerate check runs at; give the inspected head so the answer binds to what is being judged |
| `--wait` | boolean | no | `false` | poll a `pending` head until CI concludes or the budget expires, instead of answering with this moment's read |
| `--budget-seconds` | integer | no | `600` | `--wait` only: total wall-clock budget, gh-call latency included |
| `--cadence-seconds` | integer | no | `30` | `--wait` only: sleep between polls |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**A `--wait` call must be invoked with a caller-side timeout above `--budget-seconds`.** The budget
bounds the verb, not the process around it: a shell timeout below the budget kills the CLI mid-poll,
no `settle` token is printed, and the caller has an `UNKNOWN` instead of an answer. The rule holds on
every harness: the caller's deadline sits strictly above the budget with room for the `gh` reads,
and where that deadline has a ceiling the budget is lowered to fit under it.

On Claude Code, that deadline is the Bash tool's `timeout`, whose ceiling is `600000` ms unless the
environment sets `BASH_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS` above it — a larger request is silently clamped to the
ceiling rather than refused, so no deadline past it can be asked for. That leaves the `600` default
budget with no headroom on either side: pair `timeout: 600000` with `--budget-seconds 480` instead.
A practical pairing, not a guaranteed CLI maximum, and a budget raised past the ceiling needs
`BASH_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS` raised with it.

**Output** — machine channel. Under `--wait`, a first line
`settle\t<settled|budget-exhausted|head-moved|governance-owed|governance-stale>`; without it that
line is absent. Then
`ci\t<sha>\t<green|red|pending|no-producer>`, then `run\t<count>` — how many check runs were
enumerated, so the line channel carries its own completeness proof. Then one line per status present
—
`check\t<success|failure|neutral|cancelled|skipped|timed_out|action_required|in_progress|queued>\t<count>`.

With `--json`:
`{"outcome":"ci","sha":…,"rollup":…,"checks":{<status>:<count>…},"scanned":<n>,"declared":<m>,"gates":{"declared":<g>,"covered":<c>}|null,"settle":<token>|null}`.

`checks` is an **evidence-array collapsed to a status tally**, on the bounded-output rule every
evidence array in this CLI follows: this skill acts on `rollup`,
and nothing here or in `SKILL.md` iterates a check row. What the rows carried that a reader does act
on — **which** check is red or still running — moves to the notes channel, where the verb names the
failing runs and the in-flight runs on their own lines. A passing check's name was the bulk of the
old payload and no reader ever wanted it.

**The one caller that did want a passing name reads it elsewhere now.** `review-ui`'s §5 named three
design gates and read their live state here; a green name reaches neither channel after the collapse,
so it would have read a gate that never ran as a gate that passed. That read moved to
`fabrika heal-ci surface`, which prints every declared required context as `producing` or `absent`
and every undeclared gating run as `extra`. That is an answer this verb could never give even
uncollapsed: a check run that does not exist has no row here, so a required gate that never ran and
a gate the repo does not declare at all were always the same silence. This verb answers "is the head
green"; `heal-ci surface` answers "is the gate armed and did it post".

**Only a context the base branch declares required is rolled up.** The declared set — branch
protection unioned with the rulesets whose ref condition matches the base — is read once per
invocation, before the first sample, through the module the other three head-reading verbs call
(`src/review/blocking.ts`). A red outside it is named on the notes channel as `review ci: failing
outside the required set: <name>, … — reported, never blocking.` and never makes this verb call the
head red; a still-running run outside it never makes it `pending` either. The `check` tally and the
`run` count stay the **whole** enumeration's: the rollup narrowed, the evidence did not, and the
completeness proof still divides by what the platform declared. A base branch declaring **nothing**
required falls back to the informational-name denylist in `src/review/rollup.ts`, so every
non-informational check blocks there. A plan-gated base takes the same denylist: GitHub's `403`
beginning `Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public` says the branch cannot declare a
required check, so it is not a permission failure. Any other declared set that cannot be read at
this token's permission is `11` naming that read as the cause — never a colour over it. Which definition answered is stated
on the notes channel on every run. The two governance-floor settle tokens read the blocking set too,
so a non-required red beside a stale floor no longer hides it.

**A head that produced runs and no *blocking* run is `pending`, never `green`.** The rollup over an
empty set is green by construction, and narrowing to the declared set opens that case wherever the
required contexts have not posted yet. What is missing there is a report, so the answer is `pending`
with the reason on the notes channel.

**The same holds when only some declared contexts have posted.** A declared required context with no
run at the head is not satisfied, so a head where three declared contexts passed and a fourth has
posted nothing is `pending`, never `green`, and the notes channel names the contexts still owed.
`--wait` keeps polling it and ends `settled` only once every declared context has a concluded run, or
`budget-exhausted` when the budget runs out first. A `red` declared context still answers `red` at
once, whatever else has not posted. `ship checks` reads the same rule from the same module
(`src/review/blocking.ts`).

**The rollup is total over the status vocabulary, fail-closed on the ambiguous rows:** `red`
when any completed run concluded `failure`, `timed_out`, `action_required` or `cancelled` (a
cancelled check proved nothing, and "proved nothing" must not read green); `pending` when none
red and any run is `queued`/`in_progress`; `green` only when every declared run completed and
each concluded `success`, `neutral` or `skipped` (the two conclusions GitHub defines as
non-blocking). No status falls outside these three buckets; an unrecognized conclusion string
is `red`, never silently dropped.

**An empty enumeration asks one further question: does this repo produce CI at all?** The two
facts are different and no longer share an answer — a repo whose checks have not reported yet is
still going to report, and a repo with no workflow of its own never will. The evidence is the
workflow *inventory* and nothing else: **existence is the whole test, and nothing inspects what a
workflow does**. A producer is a workflow the repo authors itself, a `.github/workflows/*` path:
the `dynamic/<provider>/<name>` entries the platform lists on the repo's behalf (default CodeQL
setup, Dependabot, the Copilot reviewer) do not count. Zero repo-authored workflows refuses on
`7`, unless the repo declares `ci.noProducer: "degrade"` in `.fabrika.jsonc`, which rolls up
`no-producer` at exit `0` with `run\t0` — its own token, never `green` and never `pending`. The
inventory is read only when the enumeration came back empty. A check run that reported proves no
producer, because a `dynamic/*` workflow reports runs too: a non-empty enumeration skips the
producer question, and gate coverage below names the repo that authors no workflow of its own.

**A passing check set is not gate coverage, and the verb no longer lets the two share a word.**
A complete, all-green enumeration that came from no workflow this repo authors is refused on `16`
— not `green`, not `pending`. The set of gates is the **live workflow inventory**: a workflow
checked into the repo is addressed by its file path (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), one the platform
provides on the repo's behalf by a synthetic `dynamic/<provider>/<name>`, and coverage is the
intersection of the first with the workflows that produced a **head-inspecting** run here. No job
names, no expected set — nothing here knows what a gate is called. Head-inspecting is read off each
run's own provenance rather than its path: the run has to carry this commit, and its event has to be
one GitHub runs against the head. `pull_request_target` is the one that is not — it carries the pull
request's head and checks out the base, so `.github/workflows/pr-cleanup.yml` is repo-authored, sits
at the head, and inspected none of it. No other event is filtered: `ci.yml`'s trusted
`workflow_dispatch` path for Release-PR head inspection counts exactly as a `pull_request` run does.
The `--sha` operand is resolved to the commit's full object name before this read, because the
Actions run list filters `head_sha` as an exact string — an abbreviation there returns no runs at
all. An operand that cannot be resolved to one is `11`, never the `16`: "no gate inspected these
bytes" is a fact about the repository, and an unresolved operand is a fact about the call. A repo
that authors no workflow of its own has no gate to have missed, and says so on stderr at exit `0`.
The read is skipped over a `red` rollup, which is already the answer a caller must act on; `green`
and `pending` are the two words that read as "nothing to do here", and both are wrong over bytes no
gate inspected.

**`--wait` is the bounded in-verb wait, and it polls a `pending` and nothing else.** A `pending` is
the ordinary state of a PR minutes after a push — exactly when a reviewer is spawned — so a caller
that can only take this moment's read has a park on a human to offer for a condition that clears
itself in minutes. The verb owns the loop, which is what keeps the ban in
[`docs/skill-conventions.md` §14, "A skill never sleeps and never polls on a timer"](../../docs/skill-conventions.md)
whole: the skill makes one call and never sleeps. The budget is **wall clock**, gh-call latency
included, so the verb cannot overrun the bound it claims to hold.

The settle token says how the wait ended, and it is the whole difference between a proven answer and
a bound that ran out:

- `settled` — CI concluded inside the budget; the rollup beside it is `green` or `red` and is a
  verdict.
- `budget-exhausted` — the budget ran out with the head still `pending`. **Nothing was proven**, and
  the rollup says so by still reading `pending`: this is a stuck or very slow queue, not a race with
  it.
- `head-moved` — the PR left the head this answer binds during the wait. The last read still binds
  what it inspected; the caller re-reads at the new head rather than trusting a stale `settled`.
- `governance-owed` — every declared required context has a run, the only unfinished check at this
  head is `governance floor at head`, and the
  `governance-floor` workflow run at this head has completed. The floor reports through a check
  run, and that check-run stays `in_progress` while no governance verdict is bound at the head, so what the wait is
  waiting for is a verdict its own caller owes. Nothing was proven — the rollup still reads `pending`
  — but unlike `budget-exhausted` the caller clears this itself: fire the governance skill, then
  re-read. The distinguishing read is the workflow run, never the check-run alone: a floor whose run
  is still in flight has not published yet and **is** waited on, unchanged.
- `governance-stale` — the rollup is `red`, the only **failing** check at this head is `governance
  floor at head`, its published verdict is `stale`, and a `governance-floor` run exists at this head
  to vouch that the row is this repo's own. Same shape as `governance-owed`, on the floor's other
  rollup: a verdict bound to an earlier head concludes `failure` rather than staying pending, so the
  read returns at once with a red its own caller clears — which on a repair round is every round
  after the first. Three reds it never covers: any other failing check beside the floor, a
  floor whose verdict is a real `fail`, and a floor that is `unresolved`, which is UNKNOWN and so
  nobody's to discount. Unlike the `absent` half, an in-flight floor run does **not**
  disqualify — that is the caller's own re-fire mid-republish. The published state is read off the
  check-run's `output.title`, never re-derived here: `review ci` relays what the PR shows rather than
  producing a second answer about the floor.

Every refusal and the `no-producer` answer are states no waiting changes, so `--wait` returns them
on the **first** read rather than burning the budget: the `16` head has no gate of this repo's coming
at all, and a repo with no producer has no run to wait for. The two governance tokens are the same
principle reaching states that only look like an ordinary `pending` and an ordinary `red`.

If `--sha` is given and does not prefix-match the PR's live head, a stderr notice names both —
the caller is enumerating a head that has moved, which is a fact worth seeing at the read even
though the `12` stale-refusal seat belongs to `review post`, the write seam.

**Scope** — the check runs at one commit, paginated, count-verified against `total_count`, and the
workflow runs carrying that commit — each judged by its path, event and head — against the repo's
live inventory.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika review ci 4321 --sha 03135b91
ci	03135b91	green
run	3
check	success	3
```

A head still queued at the read, waited out to its verdict:

```
$ fabrika review ci 4321 --sha 03135b91 --wait
settle	settled
ci	03135b91	green
run	3
check	success	3
```

The same call on a queue that never finishes — `pending` beside the token, and never a verdict:

```
$ fabrika review ci 4321 --sha 03135b91 --wait --budget-seconds 120
settle	budget-exhausted
ci	03135b91	pending
run	3
check	success	1
check	queued	2
```

A `governance: required` diff whose floor is the last thing pending — the budget is not spent,
because the caller is the one who owes the verdict:

```
$ fabrika review ci 4321 --sha 03135b91 --wait
settle	governance-owed
ci	03135b91	pending
run	3
check	success	2
check	in_progress	1
```

The repair round of that same PR: the verdict is bound to the head before this one, so the floor
concludes `failure` and the rollup is `red` — a red the caller clears with one governance post:

```
$ fabrika review ci 4321 --sha 03135b91 --wait
settle	governance-stale
ci	03135b91	red
run	3
check	success	2
check	failure	1
```

**Grounding**

- **A CI read that depended on the dispatch prompt.** In v1 a gate ruled on a live RED check as a
  prose question, because one sentence was omitted from the prompt. This verb is that read made
  structural.
- **Received below declared is an explicit refusal** — the pagination-honesty rule reused rather
  than a divergent second CI read.
- **A conflicted branch stops producing `pull_request` runs** while a platform-provided scanner
  keeps reporting on its own trigger. The verb once read `green` over four such runs at an assembly
  head the repo's own gates had never seen. `green` and "no gate ran" were one word, and the second
  is the dangerous one.
- **A reviewer waiting on itself.** One run burned a full budget on a head whose only pending check
  was the governance floor, then posted the verdict that cleared it in a single round. The waiting
  verb and the thing waited on were the same shell, so `budget-exhausted` sent a self-clearing
  condition to a human park.
- **The other half of the same root cause.** A repair round's floor is `stale`, not `absent`, so it
  concludes `failure` and `--wait` returns `red` on the first read. A reviewer following this
  skill's rule that a red rollup is the code class's execution evidence would FAIL a PR over a
  floor it had just cleared.

## `review verdicts`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika review verdicts 4321 [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. First line: `verdicts\t<live-head>\t<count>`, where `<count>` is
the number of verdict rows found (`0` is a valid, proven answer: the PR carries no
verdict). Then one line per marker, newest first:
`<namespace>\t<polarity>\t<marker-sha>\t<current|stale|unbindable>\t<comment-id>\t<standing|superseded>`
— the marker SHA
is the head the verdict was formed at, which need not be the live head for the row
to read `current`, and the sixth field says whether the verdict is the one in force or one retired
below its comment's supersede fence. Advisory
carriers (a `Reviewed-head: @ <sha>` body line under an advisory first line) print with polarity
`ADVISORY` and the body-bound SHA. Malformed markers — bytes reaching for the format that fail
it — print as `malformed\t-\t-\t-\t<comment-id>\t-` with the wire reason on stderr: **a drifted
marker is surfaced as a defect, never dropped from the sweep** (a dropped row is how a FAIL'd PR
reads as unreviewed).

**A superseded verdict gets its own row.** `review post` retires the prior verdict below the
`<!-- fabrika:superseded -->` fence rather than over it, so those bytes are still on the PR;
printing only the survivor would report exactly the erasure the append exists to prevent.
Only a `standing` row is a verdict in force, and `ship gate` reads no other kind.

With `--json`: `{"outcome":"verdicts","head":…,"markers":[{namespace,polarity,sha,binding,commentId,standing}…],"malformed":[{commentId,reason}…],"scanned":<comments>}`.

**Binding is computed here, per marker** — `bindToContent` from
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/verdict-marker.ts`, imported, and the same derivation `ship gate`
uses so the two cannot disagree. The three outcomes reach stdout as three tokens. A marker at the
live head is `current`; one at another head is `current` only while the content digest it carries
is still this head's, and `stale` otherwise. A head this verb cannot resolve — or a
content-bound marker whose head digest cannot be read — prints `unbindable`, never `current` and
never `stale`, because a comparison that could not be made is not a negative result.

The digest read is **lazy**: it runs only when a content-bound marker has already failed the head
test, so an ordinary sweep touches no `git` at all.

<!-- anchor: ABSENCE-IS-NEVER-A-BINDING --> **A marker carrying no content field is head-bound, and
that is the stricter answer, not a free pass.** Absence of the field never widens what a verdict
survives: a legacy marker, a hand-written one and a typo'd one all fall back to head equality, and a
`content:` token that reaches for the field and misses reads `malformed` rather than head-only. Any
change that lets a missing or unreadable content field resolve `current` inverts this and needs its
own record.

Each comment's **first non-blank line** is what is read (the format's anchoring rule); a marker
quoted further down a body is not a marker, which is why one comment carries one namespace.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404) |
| `11` | the comment list could not be read — whether verdicts exist is UNKNOWN, never `0` |
| `13` | the comment enumeration is provably short of the declared count |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `review verdicts: PR #<n> not found in <repo>.` | 7 | refusal |
| `review verdicts: cannot read #<n>'s comments: <reason> — whether verdicts exist is UNKNOWN, never zero.` | 11 | refusal |
| `review verdicts: received <k> of <m> comments — refusing the partial sweep.` | 13 | refusal |
| `review verdicts: comment <id> reaches for a marker and fails the format: <wire reason>.` | 0 | notice |

**Scope** — every issue comment on the PR, paginated and count-checked; each body's first
non-blank line tested through the registered format's `read`, imported. The live head resolution
that feeds `bindToHead` is part of this verb's read — its failure is the all-rows-`unbindable`
answer, not an exit, because the markers themselves were seen and are reportable facts.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika review verdicts 4321
verdicts	03135b91aa04f7e2c9d8b1640a5c22e9f01b7d3c	2
review-code	PASS	0b1c2d3e	stale	5154891644	standing

review-ui	FAIL	77f61ce9	current	5460446728	superseded
```

**Grounding**

- **A dropped namespace read as a pass.** The sweep prints every marker it saw, and a short read
  refuses rather than narrowing.
- **Staleness read as current.** The binding column is the three-outcome type on the wire, computed
  against the live head at read time.
- `wire check` exits 0 on a stale PASS by construction (binding is deliberately not a property of
  the bytes); this verb is the caller-side half the type was designed for, so no consumer needs
  to fold the three outcomes to use them.

**This column answers the tree and not the contract, and there is a second currency question it
cannot see.** A verdict written before the newest standing ruling on the issue graded a spec that has
since moved: it binds this head, it may still bind this head's content, and it never read the ruling.
`fabrika lane prove` asks that second question on the `PASS` arm — it reads the issue's standing
rulings through the same roster-gated scan `review criteria` folds, and rows a verdict written before
the newest one `stale`, so a `PASS` cannot carry a lane past a ruling nobody graded
(`packages/fabrika-cli/src/lane/ruling-currency.ts`). A stamp that will not read is `unknown`, never
current. The park arm asks nothing of it: a park is refused only by a FAIL that still binds, and a
ruling cannot make one bind harder.

## `review deviations`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika review deviations 4321 [--sha <head>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--sha` | string | no | the PR's live head | the head to read the diff at; see the binding step above |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. First line: `deviations\t<found|none-declared|absent|malformed>`.
On `found`, one line per entry: `entry\t<class-label-or-->\t<Said>` (the null
token is the ASCII hyphen `-`, the same one `review verdicts` uses; a **Said** authored across
wrapped lines is carried in full, collapsed to one line, so the answer never holds a partial clause). Then the
Tier-M scan over the head diff, one line per hit:
`tier-m\t<suppression|removed-assertion>\t<file>:<line>\t<token>` — the mechanically-detectable
§DEV classes (an in-diff `biome-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error` / `test.skip` / `.only`; a deleted
assertion line), each a fact the judgment layer matches against the disclosed entries.

`none-declared` is the literal `None.` body; `absent` is **no `## Deviations` heading at all**;
`malformed` is a heading whose section fits neither shape. Which shapes those are is not stated
here: the grammar is the registered `deviations` wire format
([`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/deviations.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/deviations.ts)),
which `build pr` refuses against at creation, so a body that verb accepted never reaches this one as
`malformed`. On `malformed` and `absent` the verb prints the format's own reason as a
diagnostic — a gate that answers a bare `malformed` never tells an author which field is missing.
The three stay distinct on the wire
because the skill's verdict vocabulary depends on the distinction: absent-on-owing fails closed,
`None.` is a checked claim, and this verb is what makes the claim checkable — a `None.` printed
beside a non-empty Tier-M list is a falsified disclosure the caller can see in one read.

With `--json`: `{"outcome":…,"entries":[{label,said}…],"tierM":[{kind,file,line,token}…]}`.

**The class-label vocabulary is this contract's, enumerated closed** — never a pointer into
v1's prose. An entry's optional label is one of `1`–`7`:

| Label | Class |
|---|---|
| `1` | scope narrowing |
| `2` | governing-ADR departure (including narrowing an invariant that lives only in skill prose, with no amending ADR in the diff) |
| `3` | known defect left unfixed |
| `4` | declined guidance |
| `5` | guard or gate bypassed |
| `6` | pre-existing test or fixture changed |
| `7` | out-of-scope change |

The classes overlap; the label is a routing hint, not the disclosure — a gate matches an
entry's substance, never its label. An entry carrying no recognizable label prints `-`.

The Tier-M scan reads the same diff `review diff` serves and applies both of its proofs to it. Its
**completeness** proof is the one `review diff` states: the denominator is a second read of the same
range — `git diff --name-only -z`, one path per `diff --git` entry — so both counts come from git
under one set of flags. That makes it a **cardinality** test and nothing more: it establishes that
the scanned bytes carry at least as many entries as the `--name-only` read lists, not that the two
reads name the same files, and not that the range is the right range — a fault that shortens both
reads alike stays invisible to it. A scan short of that denominator is refused on `13`, because an
under-reported hit list beside a `None.` reads as a checked-clean disclosure that was never checked.
GitHub's declared `changed_files` is read and reported beside the two counts as a cross-check that
never refuses. Its **commit binding**: the bytes come from the object database at the bound
commit, because a hit list read at a head nobody scoped is under- or over-reported against the
disclosure it is printed beside — and it fails open, answering `none-declared` at exit 0.

**Exit status**

| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404) |
| `10` | `--sha` is not a head SHA |

| `review deviations: <what> — the artifact cannot be bound to a commit, so what it shows is UNKNOWN.` | 11 | refusal |
| `review deviations: cannot read #<n>'s body or diff: <reason> — the disclosure state is UNKNOWN, never "none".` | 11 | refusal |
| `review deviations: cannot read the file list of the range <base>...<head> for #<n>: <reason> — the disclosure state is UNKNOWN, never "none".` | 11 | refusal |
| `review deviations: the scan at <sha> covers <k> of the <m> files git lists for the same range <base>...<head> — both counts from git, so these bytes are provably short of the range they were read from; refusing a partial Tier-M scan beside a disclosure claim.` | 13 | refusal |

**Scope** — one PR body's `## Deviations` section plus the bound commit's diff for the Tier-M token
scan, completeness-checked against the file list git reports for the same range. The bound commit,
the scanned file count, that range count and GitHub's declared changed-file count (reported as a
cross-check, never refused on) go to stderr on the answer path.
Whether the PR *owes* the section, and whether an entry's substance covers a finding (Tier R),
are the skill's judgment; this verb reports states and facts, never the §DEV verdict row.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika review deviations 4321
deviations	none-declared
```

```
$ fabrika review deviations 4322
deviations	found
entry	6	replaced the two-decimal rendering assertion
tier-m	removed-assertion	src/cart.test.ts:14	expect(renderTotal(10)).toBe("10.00")
```

**Grounding**

- **v1's disclosure format** — the four fields, seven classes and M/R/D tiers this verb
  arms; read for semantics, reimplemented here. Its canonical Tier-M scan was
  specified as a shared script that **no gate actually calls** (the S8 scar) and its heading
  detection is triplicated in awk across three surfaces; one verb ends both.
- "A `deviation-disclosure: PASS` means 'nothing undisclosed that this gate could see'" — the M
  tier is exactly what this gate *can* see deterministically; the verb is that clause's
  mechanical floor.
- **The completeness denominator is a second local-git read of the same range**, not GitHub's
  declared `changed_files`: GitHub computes over its own merge base with its own rename detection,
  which counts two files where git's list carries one path. So the disagreement is reported in the
  diagnostics and never refused on, and the `13` rests on git alone.

## `review report`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika review report 4321 [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. First line: `report\t<found|absent|malformed>`. On `found`, every
line after it is the section's text, verbatim: outer blank lines dropped, interior lines untouched.
With `--json`: `{"outcome":…,"text":<string|null>}`, `text` being `null` off `found`.

The three states are the answers of the registered `report` wire format
([`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/report.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/report.ts)),
which owns the section's grammar. `build push`, `build pr` and `build pr-body` run the same read
before they post a body and refuse a `malformed` section, so a body those verbs accepted reads
`found` or `absent` here. What this verb's caller needs from that grammar:

- `found` — the body under the one heading `## Report`, up to the next heading of level 1 or 2
  outside a code fence, so an author's `###` subheadings stay inside it. A trailing closing-keyword
  line (`Fixes #N`) is the PR's link and is left out.
- `absent` — no heading reaches for the section. `## Test report` and `## Reporting` are an
  author's own headings and do not.
- `malformed` — a heading reaches for it and the section cannot be served: the level or spelling
  drifted, more than one heading reaches for it, or the section is empty. A body edited outside the
  build verbs is how this state still arrives.

On `absent` and `malformed` the reason goes to stderr. Both answer at exit `0`: each is a proven
fact about a body that was read, which is what lets the skill grade a criterion on it. A body that
could not be read is exit `11` with nothing on stdout.

**The read binds no commit.** A PR body is not part of any tree, so this verb takes no `--sha` and
reads the body as it stands when the verb runs.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the PR is proven absent (404) |
| `11` | the PR body could not be read — the report state is UNKNOWN |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `review report: PR #<n> not found in <repo>.` | 7 | refusal |
| `review report: cannot read #<n>'s body: <reason> — the report state is UNKNOWN, never "absent".` | 11 | refusal |

**Scope** — one PR body's `## Report` section. Body prose outside that section and outside
`## Deviations` stays unserved. Whether a criterion asks for a report, and whether the text answers
it, are the skill's judgment; this verb reports a state and the author's words, never a grade.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika review report 4321
report	found
Audit scope: every caller of `refocus()`. Retained duplication: none.
```

```
$ fabrika review report 4322
report	absent
```

**Grounding**

- **The founder ruling on the read gap**, cited by the `@ruling` tag on
  [`report-verb.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/report-verb.ts). A criterion that
  asks the author to report something had no channel the gate could read, so a clean PR ended
  UNKNOWN: the reviewer could not PASS a report it never saw, and unseen is not absent, so it could
  not FAIL one either. The ruling widens the read by one named section instead of narrowing what a
  criterion may ask.

## `review post`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika review post 4321 --namespace review-code --polarity PASS --sha 03135b91 --round 1 --clause "merge-ready" [--carrier marker|advisory] [--supersede] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
fabrika review post 5830 --namespace review --polarity PASS --base 9f2c1ab --tip 03135b9 --round 1 --clause "every criterion met" [--supersede] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

The verdict body arrives on **stdin only** — no `--body`, no `--body-file`, for the reason the
sibling write verbs give: a path flag is how a machine-local path reaches a public surface while
the poster reads success.

**A body the harness will not carry in one command is staged and redirected in, which is this same
path and not a second one.** A worktree-isolated shell's verifier judges the whole command string,
so a heredoc carrying a long verdict is refused before the verb runs; the measured triggers and
sizes have one home in
[skill-conventions §4](../../docs/skill-conventions.md#a-body-too-large-for-one-command-is-staged-never-trimmed).
The caller allocates a file with `review scratch`, writes the body there in bounded appends naming
the literal path, and runs this verb with a literal input redirect:

```
fabrika review post 4321 --namespace review-code --polarity FAIL --sha 03135b91 --clause "two findings" < /var/folders/kx/T/fabrika-review/s-9f2e/4321-8c9e018c5568/verdict-code
```

The bytes reach stdin unchanged, so every step and every refusal below applies exactly as it does to
a heredoc — the empty-stdin `3`, the bare-`@` `6`, the leak scan's `5`, and the unconditional
read-back's `9`. It buys relief from verifier command-size pressure and nothing else: it is not a
second emit path, it does not let the verb read a path, and it adds no argument.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull-request number — with `--base`/`--tip`, the child issue instead |
| `--namespace` | string | yes | — | the namespace this verdict fills; must match the wire format's class and be in this PR's derived class set — ranged, the set the range's own changed paths derive |
| `--polarity` | enum | yes | — | `PASS` or `FAIL` — a third token is not a polarity |
| `--sha` | string | unless ranged | — | the head the reviewer actually inspected (7–40 lowercase hex); required unless `--base`/`--tip` scope the verdict to a range, and refused beside one |
| `--base` | string | with `--tip` | — | the range's base end, 7–40 lowercase hex — the epic-child form |
| `--tip` | string | with `--base` | — | the range's tip end |
| `--clause` | string | yes | — | the human clause; blank is not a clause |
| `--carrier` | enum | no | `marker` | `marker` (first-line head- and content-bound marker) or `advisory` (§CP: advisory first line, `Reviewed-head: @ <sha>` in the body). `advisory` is a PASS path only, and is refused beside a range |
| `--supersede` | boolean | no | `false` | acknowledge that this verdict retires a standing one of the **opposite** polarity at the same head, or ranged, over the same range; without it that post is the `17` refusal |
| `--round` | integer | on a `PASS` | — | which review round this verdict ends — the same number `review append-criterion --round` was handed. Required on a `PASS`, because a `PASS` is the terminal an appended row cannot survive; ignored on a `FAIL`, which routes into a next cycle either way |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |
| stdin | markdown | yes | — | the verdict body below the first line: per-criterion table, findings, the §DEV row |

**Output** — machine channel. One line:
`posted\t<namespace>\t<polarity>\t<sha|base..tip>\t<content>\t<created|superseded>\t<comment-url>` — counting
`posted` as the first field, the **fourth** names the subject the verdict binds — the head in PR mode,
`<base>..<tip>` in range mode — the **fifth** is the content digest the verdict binds, and
the **sixth** says whether the write opened a fresh comment or appended into this namespace's
existing comment at that same subject, retiring the verdict that was there.
With `--json`: `{"outcome":"posted","namespace":…,"polarity":…,"sha":…,"content":…,"upsert":"created"|"superseded","carrier":…,"commentUrl":…}`;
ranged, the `sha` and `carrier` fields give way to one `range`:
`{"outcome":"posted","namespace":…,"polarity":…,"range":{"base":…,"tip":…},"content":…,"upsert":"created"|"superseded","commentUrl":…}`.

**Range mode — `--base`/`--tip`, the epic-child form.** An epic child opens no PR
mid-run, so there is no head to bind to and no PR surface to post on: the positional names the
**child issue**, the class set is recomputed over what `<base>...<tip>` changed in this checkout, and
the first line goes through the `range-verdict-marker` format `lane prove` folds rather than the
head-bound one. `--sha` and `--carrier advisory` are both head-scoped ideas, and are refused here
rather than ignored. The six steps below hold with the range in the head's place: step 1 becomes the
target proof — the positional must be an open issue and not a pull request — step 2 derives over the
range's changed paths, and step 5's upsert key is the range, prefix-matched on **both** ends, so a
re-post over the same range appends into the one comment while a verdict over a moved tip is a
different fact that opens a second. The write path is
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/range-post.ts`, which `governance post --base/--tip` also runs.

**What the operation does, in order — each step gates the next.**

1. **Re-resolve the live head.** `--sha` not prefix-matching it is the `12` refusal: a verdict
   formed over a moved-past tree is re-reviewed, never re-bound. This is `bindToHead`'s `Stale`
   arm applied at the write seam, where its absence costs the most.
2. **Recompute the class set at the bound commit** (the same partition `review scope` prints,
   read through the shared binding step above) and refuse a `--namespace` outside it on `10`.
   This is the disjointness guarantee made structural: v1 got "a gate never emits another gate's
   marker" free from one-skill-per-namespace; under one owner the emit path itself enforces it,
   so a namespace this run did not derive cannot be filled even by a confused caller. The set is
   documented as both floor and ceiling, which is why it is derived from `--sha`'s commit and not
   from the PR-number file endpoint: `12` above proves the tree is still the live one, not that
   the list came from it.
3. **Compose the first line through the wire format's `emit`**
   (`verdict-marker.ts`, imported — fields `namespace`/`polarity`/`sha`/`content`/`clause`), or with
   `--carrier advisory` the fixed advisory line with the `Reviewed-head: @ <sha>` body line;
   `advisory` with `--polarity FAIL` is a `10` refusal — a §CP FAIL posts the ordinary FAIL
   marker.
4. **Leak-scan the assembled comment** (`report/leaks.ts`, imported) — an authored machine-local
   path is the `5` refusal.
5. **Append into one comment per namespace *at this head*, matched under the carrier this post
   uses**: an existing comment by this bot that already carries this namespace **under this carrier,
   bound to the head being posted**, receives the fresh verdict on its first line with its prior
   verdict retired verbatim below the `<!-- fabrika:superseded -->` fence, under a dated
   `## Superseded verdict — YYYY-MM-DD` heading; otherwise a new comment is created. **The prior
   verdict is never replaced.** GitHub keeps no comment-body history, so a PATCH over a verdict is
   that verdict gone: on one PR a FAIL became a PASS at an unchanged head and nothing anywhere
   showed a gate had ever blocked. The fresh verdict goes on top because the marker is the
   comment's first non-blank line, so every reader — `ship gate`, `review verdicts`, `lane prove` —
   resolves the newest one without knowing the envelope exists. When the write would retire a
   standing verdict of the **opposite** polarity at this head, the post is the `17` refusal unless
   `--supersede` is passed, and nothing is written on that refusal — the flip is legitimate and
   routine, but it is the one that decides the merge, so it is said out loud. A post at a moved head
   appends a new comment, leaving the prior head's verdict intact — a
   verdict is SHA-bound, so a new head's verdict is a different fact, not a revision, and editing
   the old comment destroys the only record of what was true over that tree. With `marker` the
   match key is the format's `read` over the first non-blank line, plus its `sha` compared
   prefix-tolerantly to the posted head. With `--carrier advisory` it is the advisory pair — its first line plus the
   `Reviewed-head: @ <sha>` body line, read through `readAdvisory`, whose SHA carries the same head
   dimension — because the advisory first line withholds the SHA, so the marker `read` can never
   match one and a marker-keyed upsert would post a **second** advisory on every re-post. The two
   keys are disjoint: a `marker` post never edits an advisory comment, and an `advisory` post never
   edits a marker one. One namespace at one head, one comment, the carrier's anchor on its literal
   first line — a second marker stacked on line 2 is un-anchored, resolves its namespace empty, and
   fail-closes a substantively-passing PR — a stall seen live.
6. **Read it back, unconditionally, from live PR state**, under the same carrier — re-fetch the
   comment and, with `marker`, hand its body to the format's `read` and require `Found` with
   exactly the five fields posted; with `--carrier advisory`, require both advisory anchors —
   `readAdvisory` yielding this namespace and a `Reviewed-head:` SHA equal to the one posted, since
   the format's `read` calls an advisory `Malformed` by design. Either way the whole comment is
   then compared against the bytes sent (through `normalizeForReadback`). A read-back that trusts a
   carried variable instead of the live state re-ships the false-PASS class; the mismatch is the
   `9` refusal.

**A `PASS` clears one more fence, between steps 2 and 3: the round that appended a criterion owes a
`FAIL` (`18`).** A reviewer that finds an in-scope defect appends it as an acceptance criterion, and
that row binds the **next** cycle — so a `PASS` on the round that appended it is the one terminal it
cannot survive: the lane folds to `ship`, the PR merges, the issue auto-closes, and the row sits
unread on a closed issue with nothing anywhere reading as wrong. That is why `--round` is required on
a `PASS` and refused-absent on `10`. The read keys on the append's own
`<!-- ac:review pr:#<n> round:<r> -->` tag, through the reader that sits beside the writer
(`packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/append.ts`), so a `PASS` on a **later** round over a row an earlier
one appended is untouched — that row standing unmet is what "binds the next cycle" means. The
`range:` spelling reads on the same path, so a child's reviewer cannot pair an append with a `PASS`
either. The issues read are every issue the PR body names, closing keywords and `Part of` alike,
because a `--partial` PR's reviewer appends to the issue it is part of. **A read that could not be
completed is `11`, never "no appended criterion"** — an unfetchable body and a malformed criteria
block are both states a routed row may be sitting in unseen, while an *absent* block is the one
proven negative, since `review append-criterion` refuses an issue carrying no conforming block.

| `12` | the live head moved past `--sha` — re-review at the new head, never re-bind |

| `18` | this round appended an acceptance criterion tagged for this same subject and round, and a `PASS` has no next cycle to carry it — the round owes a `FAIL`; nothing written |

**Scope** — one PR: its live head (step 1), the bound commit's file list (step 2), the bodies of the
issues it names (the `PASS` fence), its comments (steps 5–6), plus the caller's stdin. Steps 1, 2
and 5's reads failing is `11` — nothing written, outcome known-unwritten. Ranged, it is one issue and one range instead: the issue's state and
comments, and what `<base>...<tip>` changes in this checkout — no PR is resolved, because there is
none.

- **A classifier that forced a contract-forbidden posting form.** A first-class verb with stdin is
  the shape that never needs one.
- **Closed enums at the emit seam** — `--polarity` and the namespace set stop a
  well-formed-looking wrong write before it lands.
- v1 emitted through four per-gate scripts with three conventions and one gate (trivial) skipping
  read-back entirely (S2/S6); one verb, one protocol, no skippable branch.
- **The advisory carrier has a fixed shape and is PASS-only** — §CP's one grammar across the
  review family.
- **An upsert that replaced a standing FAIL with a PASS** left the record of the block
  unrecoverable; the append and the `17` refusal are that incident's two answers. The same question
  was settled for issue bodies, and `report amend` is the precedent this follows.
- **The range form exists because an epic child has no PR to bind to mid-run.** Its
  write path is `packages/fabrika-cli/src/review/range-post.ts`, one module rather than a per-verb
  copy: `review post` and `governance post` differ there in exactly one decision — which namespace
  the range's own paths admit — so the two verbs cannot drift on what a ranged post does. The
  append reaches it too, keyed on the range where the PR path keys on the head.

## `review append-criterion`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika review append-criterion 4287 --pr 4321 --round 1 [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
fabrika review append-criterion 6095 --base 9f2c1ab --tip 03135b9 --round 1 [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

The criterion text arrives on **stdin** — one checkbox row's text, without the leading `- [ ]`.

**The subject is a PR or a range, never both.** An epic child has no pull request mid-run, so
`--base`/`--tip` name what the round was judged over, exactly as they do for `review post`.
All four fences run identically on either form; the only thing that differs is what the provenance
tag names.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the linked issue receiving the criterion — on the range form, the epic child |
| `--pr` | integer | yes, unless `--base`/`--tip` | — | the PR whose review round produced the finding — half the provenance tag |
| `--base` | string | yes, unless `--pr` | — | with `--tip`: the range `<base>..<tip>` the round was judged over, standing in for `--pr`; never combined with `--pr` |
| `--tip` | string | with `--base` | — | the range's tip revision — the other half of `--base` |
| `--round` | integer | yes | — | this review round's number; at or past the freeze (`src/retry-budget.ts`'s `CAP_ROUND`) the verb escalates instead of appending |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |
| stdin | markdown | yes | — | the criterion text |

**Output** — machine channel. One line: `appended\t<issue>\t<row-count-after>`, or
`escalated-frozen\t<issue>\t<round>` when `--round` is at or past `CAP_ROUND` — the escalation comment landed and the
AC did **not** (fence 3: append-rate stays bounded by fix-rate, so the finding enters no contract).
Both are proven answers at exit 0, discriminated by the token.

**The escalation comment is machine-readable, and that is what keeps the token honest.** It carries
`<!-- ac:escalated pr:#<pr> round:<n> -->` — the same grammar the provenance tag is written under,
in `src/review/append.ts` — and `build verdicts` folds every such comment on the issue into its
`escalatedFindings`. So the next repair round reads the finding through the verb it already opens,
rather than through a comment id a driver typed into a spawn prompt. The prose beside the
tag says the same thing to a human reading the issue: the finding is on record, the round after this
one repairs it, and a human is asked only once the round budget is spent.

With `--json`: `{"outcome":…,"issue":…,"rows":…,"round":…,"acl":"write+"}`.

**The four fences, enforced in this order:**

1. **ACL-gated, fail-closed**: resolve the invoking token's repository permission;
   below `write`, or any ACL lookup failure, refuses — authority comes from the ACL check, never
   from the text being plausible.
2. **Append-only**: the new body is the old body plus exactly one row (`- [ ] <text>
   <!-- ac:review pr:#<pr> round:<round> -->`, or `<!-- ac:review range:<base>..<tip> round:<round> -->`
   on the range form — the range spelled as `range-verdict-marker.ts` spells it, so one range reads
   the same in a criterion row and in the verdicts `lane prove` folds) under the existing conforming heading; a diff
   guard refuses any write that would drop or mutate a prior byte. The row lands after the last
   criterion's **last physical line**, taken from the parser's own span — a criterion that wraps
   spans several lines and its text appears on none of them, so matching text against lines found
   no anchor and refused every append on such a body.
3. **Frozen at the repair budget's round K**, read from `src/retry-budget.ts`'s `CAP_ROUND`: a `--round` at
   or past it posts the tagged escalation comment instead of appending. The finding is not thereby
   lost — it is on record and folded by `build verdicts` — it is only kept out of the contract.
4. **In-scope-only is the caller's** (the trace-to-stated-goal test is judgment); the provenance
   tag is what makes a routed row auditable after the fact.

The row enters the **next** review cycle's conjunctive verdict; the verb does not touch the PR.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing |
| `5` | the criterion text carries a machine-local path |
| `6` | the text is a bare `@` path reference |
| `7` | the issue is proven absent (404) or closed; or its body carries no conforming acceptance-criteria block to append under (the wire read's `Absent`/`Malformed`, distinguished on stderr) |
| `8` | the body PATCH, or on the frozen path the escalation comment, failed — UNKNOWN; the message names which |
| `9` | the write landed but the read-back does not show exactly the old rows plus this one |
| `10` | the flags name no subject, or two — no `--pr` and no range, `--pr` beside a range, a lone `--base`/`--tip`, or an end that is not a revision |
| `11` | the issue body, the ACL, or the block could not be read — nothing was written |
| `14` | refused: the invoking token resolves below `write`, or the ACL lookup failed, fail-closed — an authorization denial, never mistakable for an absent target |
| `15` | refused: the composed write is not provably the old body plus one row — the append-only fence. Its three causes carry three different messages: no row to append under, a line the diff guard says would move (named), or a composed body the format re-reads as something other than the prior rows plus this one |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `review append-criterion: no criterion on stdin.` | 3 | refusal |
| `review append-criterion: the criterion carries a machine-local path at line <k> (<class>) — rewrite it repo-relative.` | 5 | refusal |

| `review append-criterion: read-back does not show the prior rows plus this one — inspect #<n>.` | 9 | refusal |

**Scope** — one issue body (through the registered AC format), the invoking token's ACL, and on
the frozen path one tagged comment write. The read-back re-reads the block through the same format and
compares row-by-row.

**Examples**

```
$ printf 'a regression test covers qty > 1' | fabrika review append-criterion 4287 --pr 4321 --round 1
appended	4287	3
```

```
$ printf 'anything' | fabrika review append-criterion 4287 --pr 4321 --round 4
escalated-frozen	4287	4
```

```
$ printf 'a regression test covers the widened union' | fabrika review append-criterion 6095 --base 9f2c1ab --tip 03135b9 --round 1
appended	6095	7
```

**Grounding**

- **Reviewer-authored acceptance criteria are routed binary**, appended under fences, and frozen
  at the repair budget's cap (the fence reads it from `src/retry-budget.ts`'s `CAP_ROUND`). v1's
  append script was mandated at four call sites and called at none — a first-class verb is the
  difference between a fence and a fence description.
- **Authority comes from the ACL check**; a below-write author or a failed lookup skips the
  append entirely, fail-closed.
- **The escalation the freeze forces had no reader.** Fence 3's comment was printed for nobody, so a
  repair round dispatched past the freeze read a contract missing the round it was sent to repair,
  and only a driver hand-writing the comment id into a spawn prompt connected the two ends. The tag
  is what `build verdicts` folds it by.

## `review scratch`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika review scratch 4321 --slug <leaf> --lane <lane-key> --sha <head>
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the pull request this lane is reviewing |
| `--slug` | string | yes | — | the file's leaf name: kebab-case, no path separators |
| `--lane` | string | yes | — | the lane key from this reviewer's spawn brief |
| `--sha` | string | yes | — | the head `review scope` bound, 7–40 hex |

**Two things are staged here, on separate slugs.** A diff too large for one read is the original
case; a **verdict body** too large for one command is the second, and it takes a slug naming its
namespace — `verdict-code`, `verdict-doc`, `verdict-skill` — so one lane's several verdicts do not
overwrite each other. Both are read by the shell, never by a verb: `review post` still takes its
body on stdin, through a literal input redirect.

**Output** — machine channel. One absolute path on stdout:
`<temp root>/fabrika-review/<session-id>/<pr>-<lane-nonce>/<slug>`. The directory is created if
absent; the leaf is not. `<lane-nonce>` is twelve hex of `sha256(<lane> \n <sha>)`. No `--json`:
the path is the answer.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `1` | the directory could not be created, `--lane` is blank, the positional is not a PR number, or no session id is set (the `FABRIKA_SESSION_ID` → `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` → `PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_SESSION` chain) or the id is not one path segment |
| `10` | `--slug` carries a path separator or is not kebab-case, or `--sha` is not a head SHA |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `review scratch: <n> is not a pull-request number.` | 1 | refusal |
| `review scratch: --lane is blank — this run names no lane, so the only namespace left is the session's, which is the one two reviewers share; refusing to allocate it.` | 1 | refusal |
| `review scratch: no session id is set — … — refusing to key a scratch namespace on an unattributable session.` | 1 | refusal |
| `review scratch: the session id is not one path segment — it cannot name a directory of its own.` | 1 | refusal |
| `review scratch: cannot create <dir>: <reason>` | 1 | refusal |
| `review scratch: --slug "<v>" must be a kebab-case leaf, no path separators.` | 10 | refusal |
| `review scratch: --sha "<v>" is not a head SHA — expected 7–40 hex characters.` | 10 | refusal |

**Scope** — one directory, allocated. It writes no file, reads no board state, and makes no network
call.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika review scratch 4321 --slug diff --lane 4287 --sha 03135b91
/var/folders/kx/T/fabrika-review/s-9f2e/4321-8c9e018c5568/diff

$ fabrika review scratch 4321 --slug diff --lane "" --sha 03135b91
review scratch: --lane is blank — this run names no lane, so the only namespace left is the
session's, which is the one two reviewers share; refusing to allocate it.
$ echo $?
1
```

**Grounding**

- **A generic scratch name two lanes both wrote.** A reviewer redirected `review diff` to a
  `diff.txt` in the shared session scratchpad and read it in two passes; between the reads a
  concurrent lane replaced the bytes with another PR's diff. The verdict would have graded one PR's
  criteria against another PR's bytes while carrying the correct head, which nothing downstream —
  `ship`'s re-derivation included — can detect. It was caught only by an unrelated cross-check
  against the PR's own file list.
- **`build scratch` and `triage scratch` took the same fix first**, both keyed on a claim token's
  nonce. This group ships no claim verb, so the key is derived from `--lane` and `--sha` instead:
  same namespace shape, a source this lane can actually name.
- **The alternative was rejected.** Having `review diff` verify staged bytes on re-read re-derives
  *detection* where the namespace makes the collision unconstructible, which is the route both
  prior fixes took.

---

## `review seat`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika review seat 8820 --base <base> --tip <tip>
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the epic child whose range this shell was briefed on |
| `--base` | string | yes | — | the range's base revision, as the brief's `range` prints it |
| `--tip` | string | yes | — | the range's tip revision — the commit this tree is seated at |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | the full result object instead of the line grammar |

**Why the tree is the wrong tree by default.** One epic run is one branch and one pull request at
the tail, so a child's build branch is local and unpushed. A reviewer worktree cut fresh from the
driver's checkout stands on the assembly branch — or on whatever that checkout last held — and the
range's tip is not in it. Every fence that reads the working tree then reads a tree the verdict
never names, and the `range-verdict-marker` binds base, tip and a content digest, never which tree
the commands ran in, so a wrong verdict is indistinguishable afterwards from a right one.

**It seats or it refuses.** Two facts have to hold: the tip resolves to a commit here, and a branch
this clone's own lane grammar says was cut for this child reaches it. Neither is a read that failed,
so both refuse on `20` rather than on the UNKNOWN seat, and a refusal is a stop — there is no arm
that grades in place. Several carrying branches is not ambiguity about the seat: each reaches the
same commit, and the commit is what the tree is put on, so all of them are reported and the first is
named.

**A candidate nobody could read decides nothing once another has carried the tip.** A clone that has
run more than one attempt at a child carries stale `build/<n>-…` refs beside the live one, so a
candidate whose ref or containment read fails is ordinary rather than exotic. Each such failure is
kept as a fact about that candidate and reported on stderr beside the seat; it becomes the `11`
refusal only where no candidate carried the tip and an unread one could have. Refusing the whole verb
on it while the seat was already proven would turn a determined answer into a park on a human.

**The seat is detached, and a re-run is not a second checkout.** A reviewer commits nothing, so
switching or moving a branch would be a mutation nobody asked for. A tree already standing on the
tip is answered by reading the commit rather than by checking out again, and the answer says which
happened. It is `git switch --detach`, not `git checkout --force`: a tree carrying uncommitted work
is left exactly as it stands and the refusal is reported rather than the work destroyed.

**Output** — machine channel. One stdout line:
`seated\t<commit>\t<branch>\t<checked-out|already-seated>`, where `<commit>` is read back off git
*after* the checkout — never the operand echoed. The carrying branches and the read-back are on
stderr. `--json` answers
`{answer, issue, base, tip, head, branch, carriers, action}`.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `1` | the positional is not an issue number |
| `8` | the checkout itself failed — where this tree stands is UNKNOWN |
| `9` | the checkout reported success and the commit reads back as another — nothing here is seated |
| `10` | a lone `--base`/`--tip`, neither given, or an end that is not a revision |
| `11` | a git read the answer turns on failed — the branch list, this tree's HEAD, the read-back, or every candidate that could have carried the tip; nothing was checked out |
| `20` | the tip is not reachable here: no lane branch of this child is in this clone, the tip resolves to no object, or no lane branch of this child reaches it |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `review seat: <n> is not an issue number.` | 1 | refusal |

| `review seat: the checkout reported success and HEAD reads <other>, not <tip> — this tree is not seated on <base>..<tip> …` | 9 | refusal |

**Scope** — one worktree, moved. It reads this clone's refs and object database, checks out one
commit, and reads the result back. No network call, no board state, no write to any artifact.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika review seat 8820 --base 99b1453 --tip 4011b1d
seated	4011b1d8238aaf1d71de8704bedb1aa1dd98fda9	build/8820-seat-the-tree-9f2e1a4b	checked-out

$ fabrika review seat 8820 --base 99b1453 --tip 4011b1d
seated	4011b1d8238aaf1d71de8704bedb1aa1dd98fda9	build/8820-seat-the-tree-9f2e1a4b	already-seated

$ fabrika review seat <child> --base 99b1453 --tip 4011b1d
review seat: no branch of this clone was cut for #<child> — "build/<child>-<slug>-<nonce>" resolves
to nothing, so 99b1453..4011b1d was built somewhere this worktree cannot see.
$ echo $?
20
```

**Grounding**

- **A reviewer graded a tree that was neither end of its range.** On one epic run the brief's range
  was `<base>..<tip>` and the reviewer's shell stood on a third commit, so its first typecheck,
  formatter, test and guard runs all read the pre-range tree. It noticed on its own, retracted both
  posted verdicts and re-graded those rows UNKNOWN. Nothing in the machinery forced that catch, and
  a less careful shell posts the verdict: a false PASS reaches the assembly merge and then the tail
  PR, a false FAIL spends one of the child's three repair rounds, and neither is visible afterwards.
- **A brief sentence was the alternative, and it is advice a shell can skip silently** — which is
  the exact failure mode here. The brief rule ships too, as the human-readable half: the byte-fixed
  `EPIC_RANGE_RULES` on a range-carrying child brief names this verb and its refusal, so a shell
  reading only its brief learns the rule. The verb is what makes it provable.
- **The tip alone was not enough.** Seating on any commit that happens to resolve would put the tree
  on a revision nothing ties to this child, so the branch this clone's lane grammar names is read
  first and the tip has to be on one — the same `childLaneBranches` nomination `lane prove` and
  `lane brief` read, never a second filter.

## The eval-enumeration obligation (leaf rule)

Stated once, in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md)'s "Eval enumeration" section — the single home that
obligation lives in. This spec adds nothing to it; the eval mechanics are their own work.
