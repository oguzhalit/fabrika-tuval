# triage

You are the guardrail. **The failure that matters is not a missing label — it is a confident wrong
one**, indistinguishable from a correct one once it lands. Each step makes its answer checkable, not
merely well-formed. You have full rewrite authority; **salvage first**.

## 1 — Claim it before you mutate it

The issue you were invoked on is `$issue_number`, and every command below carries it. A blank there
does not mean no number exists: a preloaded agent shell (`skills:` frontmatter) always substitutes
blank, because the harness hands the preload an empty argument and the number arrives in the spawn
brief instead — so on a blank, take the issue your caller named there. Only when no caller named
one are you actually without a number, and then ask for it before running a verb. Never invent one
nobody named.

```bash
fabrika triage claim $issue_number
```

Done when it printed `won\t<claim-token>` — that means **this lane** holds it; on anything else, move
on. **Keep the token.** A fan-out runs several triagers under one session id, so the token is the
only thing that tells your lane from a sibling's: pass it back as `--token` if you ever re-run the
claim, and never re-run without it — a tokenless re-run is a new lane racing your own. What `lost`
proves, and which refusal each exit code carries, is the verb's own section
(`fabrika wire doc-section --heading "triage claim" < <skill-base>/contract.md`).

**That rule has teeth now, and the token is what gives it them.** Every per-issue verb below that
writes — `enrich`, `apply`, `park`, `kill`, `split` — re-reads the claim before its first write and refuses
on `17` when a live marker names another claimant, so proceeding on a `lost` no longer overwrites the
winner's work; it just fails. **Pass `--token <claim-token>` to every one of those five.** Without it
the verb can only tell that *some* lane of your session holds the claim, which is exactly the sibling
it cannot tell you from — so it falls back to a fail-closed reading and refuses the moment two lanes
of your session hold live markers. With it, a sibling's claim is refused and your own passes. The
same re-read refuses a closed target on `7`. Neither refusal is overridable, and a comment read that
fails is `11` — never a pass.

**Every working file you write is one this verb printed, and nowhere else:**

```bash
fabrika triage scratch $issue_number --slug authored --token <claim-token>
```

**That prints one file, and its name is the `--slug` you passed.** The parent directory is created
for you and the leaf is not, so write the path exactly as printed — there is nothing to `mkdir`, and
appending to it (`<printed>/body.md`) fails with `no such file or directory` because the leaf is a
file, not a folder. **A second working file is a second `scratch` call with a different slug**,
`--slug notes` beside `--slug authored`.

The token's nonce is what keys those paths to your lane. A fan-out shares one session scratchpad, so
a slug picked by convention — `authored` — names the same leaf in every lane, and without the nonce
a sibling's write lands on yours silently and the body you then post is another issue's. The path is
machine-local and must never reach a posted artifact; the writing verbs red on it (`5`).

## 2 — Read the issue, then read the code it is about

Never classify from the title. Read the body, then read enough of the repo to say what this is about
in your own words. **Check any falsifiable claim it rests on against source before enriching on top
of it** — a summary of a contract is not the contract. A hand-filed issue skipped dedup:

```bash
fabrika report dedup --query "definition editor loses focus after save" --exclude $issue_number
```

Read `candidates` yourself — shared vocabulary is not a shared observation. A closed match needs
a behavior check before it can count as already fixed; `indeterminate` is a
non-check, so re-query. `--exclude` is this group's extension to the `report` verb, and its grammar
is the section that adds it:
`fabrika wire doc-section --heading "report dedup — the --exclude extension" < <skill-base>/contract.md`. A duplicate routes by who filed it (step 8).

**On an agent-filed report, read the gap at `origin/main` before you enrich anything on top of it.**
An agent files from a worktree whose skills and code were cut before a fix merged, so it reports a
gap main has already closed — and enriching that is a founder ruling spent on a bug that was never
live. Four parked KILLs in one queue drain were this one shape. So fetch, then read the file or verb
the issue names **at main** — never the copy in the checkout you are standing in, which is the
filer's snapshot or your own:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git show origin/main:packages/fabrika-cli/src/lane/assembly-verb.ts
```

A gap the artifact at main no longer has is **superseded**: close it yourself under §8's `superseded`
clause with `fabrika triage kill $issue_number --confirm`, and say in the note what landed and where
you read it. **No founder ruling is owed for that close** — triage closes a twin on its own
judgment, and the freshness check belongs at this layer for the same reason: intake is the last
place a stale report is caught before a lane spends a whole round rebuilding a fix that already
landed. This close carries no `--duplicate-of`, so it reaches agent filings only:
§8's rule stands unchanged — **a human filing is parked, never killed** on this path, however
plainly main already fixed it. Fold it into a survivor with `--duplicate-of` and provenance stops
mattering; a bare `--confirm` close of a human filing still refuses on `12`.

Done when you can state the issue from the code, the dedup outcome is read, and an agent-filed gap
has been read at main.

## 3 — Classify into exactly one of six types

| Type | The issue is this when… |
|---|---|
| `type:bug` | **Behavior diverges from intent.** Something built does the wrong thing; a "supposed to" is violated. |
| `type:feature` | **A new capability, directly implementable.** It does not exist, the path is clear, it fits in a PR or a few. |
| `type:chore` | **No behavior change.** Refactor, rename, dep bump, doc edit — observable behavior is identical after. |
| `type:decision` | **One question; the output is a recorded choice.** The deliverable is "we decided X", not "we built X". |
| `type:investigation` | **An unknown; the output is knowledge.** You cannot say what to build because nobody knows what is wrong. |
| `type:epic` | **Too big for one PR; it spawns children.** The deliverable is a plan plus sub-issues. |

- **decision vs epic** — one question → decision; many, or questions-plus-buildable-children → epic.
- **bug vs investigation** — a nameable fix → bug. An investigation whose answer *might* be trivial
  stays one; `build` owns that collapse, and re-typing in anticipation was rejected.
- **feature vs epic** — judge the *real* deliverable. **Do not invent a v1 scope to make an epic fit
  a PR**; if you must carve the work down to call it a feature, it is an epic and your carve-out is
  its first child. Tells: missing prerequisite infrastructure, implied new surfaces, and your own
  hedging — "if this balloons, split X out" is the epic boundary talking.
- **decision vs the type you already picked** — if landing on that type meant rejecting a *named
  alternative* on a developer-experience or product-facing surface, the rejection is the tell:
  someone still has to pick that direction, so it leaves triage as a `type:decision`, or as the type
  you picked stamped `ready-for:human` in step 7. **"Forced" describes implementation mechanics,
  never direction** — step 4's *forced fit* is the separate question of where a ticket attaches — and
  "no PR in this repo can change X" eliminates nothing on its own, because the code X invokes is
  usually repo-ownable (a globally installed shim vs the repo's own
  `packages/fabrika-cli/src/bin.ts`; that exclusion cost a full build round).

Done when one type holds and you can name the question that excluded its nearest neighbour — a
question about which category this is, never about which direction it should take.

## 4 — Attach before you mint

**Search the board for an open epic or issue on the same surface before you leave this as standalone
work.** Step 2's dedup asks whether this exact observation is already filed; this asks the wider
question — is there already a ticket that *owns this surface* and should absorb it? Query on the
surface, not on your issue's wording:

```bash
fabrika report dedup --query "definition editor keyboard focus" --exclude $issue_number
```

Read the candidates yourself and take the cheapest true route:

- **An open epic or issue already owns this surface** → **fold in and close**, which is the preferred
  outcome. Add this issue's content to the survivor, then close this one against it so the trail runs
  both ways — the survivor carries the content, this issue points at the survivor. `fabrika triage
  kill $issue_number --confirm --duplicate-of 8` is the folding route, and it is open whatever the
  provenance — a human filing folds and closes here exactly as an agent filing does, because a
  fold moves the content into the survivor instead of discarding it. `--confirm` is still required,
  and it is the `--duplicate-of` that opens the close, not the `--confirm`: a bare `--confirm` close
  of a human filing still refuses on `12` (step 8).
- **Several small items cluster on one surface with no owner yet** → **make the cluster an epic**
  rather than minting each item as its own ticket. An epic's children ship as one pull request, so a
  cluster of small items costs one review-and-merge round instead of five.
- **Nothing owns the surface, or the fit is forced** → **mint it standalone and say why** in your
  step 6 rewrite: one line naming what you searched and why nothing absorbed it. A forced fold-in is
  worse than a new ticket; the reason is what stops the next triager re-litigating the same search.

Done when you have taken one of the three routes and the reason is written down.

## 5 — Split a bundle into single units

Two problems agents could work at different times are a bundle; two facets of one change are not.

```bash
fabrika triage split $issue_number --title "Editor loses focus after save" --token <claim-token> <<'EOF'
…
EOF
```

What the child carries over from the parent, and what it deliberately does not, is the verb's
section (`fabrika wire doc-section --heading "triage split" < <skill-base>/contract.md`, and
`--heading "The child this verb creates"` for the child's shape).

Done when every unit is separately pickable. **A human-filed original always stays one of the
units** — only an agent filing may be left as an empty husk and killed, because a husk parked on
`status:needs-info` is a question nobody can answer. The `--duplicate-of` exception below does not
reach here: a split leaves no survivor to fold the original into, so nothing licenses that close.

## 6 — Home it, then enrich: rewrite on top, original preserved beneath

**Every issue leaves with a home** — an open milestone, or one of the two standing lanes.
Lane-entering work (an epic, or a parentless feature) additionally carries a `## Pitch` whose `Arc`
*is* that home — inside your rewrite for a feature, on stdin for an epic. **Approving a pitch is the
founder's, and triage leaves it to him**: by a `pitch-approved:` comment, or by setting the issue's
betting-table row to Stage `bet` — his own write or an agent's on his instruction, with the row's
Size matching the pitch's Appetite. **That rule is yours to keep.** The guard reads the approving
account's write access and refuses a comment carrying an agent stamp; it does not read who typed,
so on a repo where agents post under the founder's account no check enforces it
([why](../../guide/how-fabrika-works.md#an-owner-only-step-confirms-an-account-not-a-person)).
**An issue that leaves triage with a pitch nobody has approved yet ends your closing message on the
ask, complete enough to act on cold.** Triage posts no approval itself, so the message is the
whole hand-off. It carries four things:

- the full approval line with the pitch's own size filled in — `pitch-approved: appetite S` for a
  pitch whose Appetite is `S`. A comment of any other shape approves nothing;
- where the line goes: a comment on the issue, named by the issue's full URL;
- one everyday sentence on what a pitch is and what the size means: a pitch is a short proposal
  naming the problem, how much effort it is worth and what is left out, and the size — `S`, `M` or
  `L`, small to large — is that effort budget;
- one sentence on what the approval is for, in the
  [pitch guard's](../../docs/guard-contract.md#pitch-guard-check) own terms: work entering a lane
  owes a pitch and the founder's approval of its size, the guard reds this issue at intake until
  that approval stands, and a size changed afterwards needs a new one.

**A founder ruling that names a parentless feature by its number discharges that feature's pitch**,
when the feature is homed in the ruling's own arc — the same milestone or the same epic. Link the
ruling in a comment on the feature whose first line is exactly this, with the feature's own number
and the URL of the comment the ruling is written in:

```text
pitch-ruled: #<n> · ruling:https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<m>#issuecomment-<comment-id>
```

Leave the body as it is: the comment is the pitch's whole trace, so a discharge without one is a
missing pitch. `guard pitch-guard check` reads that first line and verifies the ruling behind it, so
a comment that links the ruling in free prose passes nothing and the feature stays red.
**The guard accepts two rulings, and it is narrower than the arc above.** One is a desk ruling on
the feature's own issue, recorded by `fabrika decision rule`. The other is a founder comment on
another issue that names the feature as `#<n>`, where that issue and the feature share one open
milestone. It never passes a "same epic" ruling, and never a feature on a standing lane over a
ruling on another issue. **You cannot run the guard from this step**: it judges only an issue that
already carries `status:triaged`, and reports any other as out of scope. Step 7 runs it after the
stamp. A feature the guard refuses there still owes its pitch: draft it as for any parentless
feature, and never re-word the comment to get past the check. A feature a ruling only implies,
however plainly, still owes its pitch. Take an existing
home: **triage never creates a milestone**, and `wayfinder:backlog` is bounded to genuine fog rather
than work you would rather not decide about.
**A board-wide homing breach is swept by a verb, never by raw `gh`.** When `guard homing-guard check`
reds on double-marked issues, `fabrika triage sweep-homes` drops the milestone and keeps the lane,
dry run first, then `--apply` with the citation on stdin. It is the one writing verb here that takes
no claim and no `--token`; its contract section says why. The un-homed issues it refuses on `27` are
yours to home one at a time here.
**An `active` campaign's milestone admits new intake only at `p0` or `p1`**, or when the work blocks
one of that milestone's own in-flight lanes — `triage homes` marks those rows
`running: p0/p1 or blocker`, and is where you read which milestones they are. This narrows
where you home, and it is yours to apply: the verb marks the row and refuses nothing, and no lane is
ever refused for its campaign. Only `p2` is subtracted, so a park reason names that band and nothing
wider; otherwise home the work by fit exactly as above.
Every row the verb prints, and what `running` is derived from, is its own section
(`fabrika wire doc-section --heading "triage homes" < <skill-base>/contract.md`).

```bash
fabrika triage homes
```

```bash
fabrika triage enrich $issue_number --token <claim-token> <<'EOF'
## In plain words

…

…
EOF
```

**Every enrichment opens with a plain-language summary**, because the person deciding the issue reads
it first and may read nothing else. Send it on stdin as one `## In plain words` section: one
paragraph of 2-3 everyday sentences saying what is wrong, who it hurts and what we would do. Keep it
honest, not salesy, and make it say what the body below it says; a summary that promises more than
the body is a wrong summary. The verb places it at the very top — above the rewrite, and above an
epic's `## Pitch` — and writes nothing when the section is wrong: exit `26` for no summary, an empty
one, or more than one, and exit `3` when the summary is all you sent and nothing follows it.

A pitch carries five fields — Problem / Arc / Appetite / Rabbit-holes / No-gos, plus an optional
Success line — whether it sits in a feature's rewrite or on an epic's stdin. Write Appetite as a
size, `S`, `M` or `L`, never as cycles; Success is the one sentence the two-week check judges the
shipped bet against. For an epic, `fabrika triage enrich $issue_number --epic` takes those fields
on the same stdin as the summary and heads them `## Pitch` above the brief, which it preserves
verbatim for the planner; no *rewrite* goes above an epic's brief. The
rewrite adds real paths and function names over vague framing, and acceptance criteria that make
"done" legible — not a closed set, a `review-*` gate may append. The criteria block's grammar is
the wire format's, not this skill's
([`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/acceptance-criteria.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/acceptance-criteria.ts)):
`enrich` runs that reader over the body it composed and refuses a drifted block on exit `15` before
writing anything, naming the defect the reader found — so write the criteria and let the verb answer.
A rewrite carrying **no** criteria block is still accepted, where none is warranted — **except over an
issue already labelled `ready-for:agent`**, where it refuses on `16` and writes nothing. That label
promises a builder can pick the issue up cold and the block is what the promise is made of, so a
criteria-less rewrite there leaves the stamp standing on no contract and the next lane backs off. The
refusal names both ways out: author the block and re-send, or drop the audience label first with
`fabrika triage apply <n> --ready-for human`. `--epic` is exempt, since an epic's criteria arrive per
child from the plan ledger. The stdin
grammar, the epic pitch's five fields and every exit the verb refuses on live in its section
(`fabrika wire doc-section --heading "triage enrich" < <skill-base>/contract.md`).

**Mark a criterion the diff cannot settle, here, where you mint it.** Some criteria are only
checkable outside the diff's bytes — a desk verified by hand, a checkpoint written *before* the fix,
a runtime observation — and a grader reading the sentence later cannot tell one of those from a
criterion that was simply never met. So say it on the row: a trailing `[evidence: <source>]` naming
where the proof lives, and `review` grades that row on the evidence it names rather than FAILing it
for byte-absence. `enrich` counts the marked rows on stderr and refuses a drifted keyword or a
marker naming no source on `15`, like any other block defect. **Mark sparingly**: a criterion a test
could discharge is not one of these, and marking it moves a mechanical check onto a reviewer's word.
The name, the grammar and what makes a usable source live in the verb's contract section
(`fabrika wire doc-section --heading "The outside-diff evidence marker" < <skill-base>/contract.md`).

**An ordering you state must already be an edge.** The native `blocked_by` graph is the one carrier
of "do not start this yet", so a rewrite saying "Blocked. Do not start until #N" over a graph with
no such edge ships an issue `build pick` admits and no lane can build — one such rewrite cost a
lane a claim. `enrich` scans the region it composed and refuses on `20`, writing nothing. **There is
no override**, and the refusal names both ways out: wire the edge in step 7 with `--blocked-by`,
then re-send, or reword so the body states no ordering it does not own. Two
things it deliberately does not red on: a phrase in a third-person voice ("it is already blocked on
#N" reports another issue's prerequisite), and a `#N` that is a **pull request** — the graph names
a blocking PR by the issue its merge closes, so there is no edge to wire. What counts as a
statement — and why it is narrow — is that verb's section
(`… --heading "A stated ordering must be an edge, and 20 is the refusal"`).
**No invention**: enrich from what you found, keep
the uncertainty the original had, and mark your own reads `Triage note:`. On a **re-type, rewrite the
body's criteria to the new type** — stale criteria under a re-scoped comment ship a misleading spec.
Done when every claim traces to something you read.

## 7 — Price it, stamp it, and say who picks it up

Run the value bar first — it is stated once, in step 8 on the `agent` kill route, and a ticket that
fails it earns a kill rather than a price. Then price what survives, on the work's own
merit: `p0` for ship-work and fires, `p1` for what you would genuinely pull next, **`p2` is the
default** and most of a healthy backlog. A roadmap row confers no band either way.

**A defect a signed-out visitor can see is priced `p1` or `p0`, never below, whatever the fix
costs.** It overrides the `p2` default. Whether a visitor can see it is your judgment on this
issue, so your `Triage note:` says why you judged the defect visible or not.

```bash
fabrika triage apply $issue_number --type bug --priority p2 --ready-for agent --home 47 --token <claim-token>
```

A standing lane takes `--lane wayfinder:backlog` (or `axis:pipeline-hardening`) **instead of**
`--home`, never both — a lane label is not a milestone number, and putting a milestone on a
lane-exempt issue is banned outright.

**Repeatable `--class <name>` says which shells the lane runs, and `ui` is the one that changes a
route.** Pass `--class ui` when the deliverable is a rendered surface, so the lane boots into
`build:ui` — and, on a single-issue lane, `review:ui` too. This stamp is the *only* producer of that
routing before a head has graded a diff: `lane open` and `lane emit` read the `class:<name>` label
and seed the lane document from it, and without it a rendered ticket builds its first round in a
shell carrying none of the design law and reaches `build:ui` only after a `review-ui` FAIL. When
the deliverable spans a rendered surface and text, pass `--class ui` beside the text class
(`--class ui --class code`): that pair boots the lane, or the epic child, into `build:mixed`, the shell
carrying both construction laws. The
vocabulary is closed — `code`, `doc`, `skill`, `ui` — and an off-set spelling refuses on `10` before
any label is written. The four labels are minted from that same set by `status bootstrap
label-taxonomy`; on a board missing one the stamp refuses on `7` rather than letting the API create
it, and running that bootstrap is the fix, never a run with the flag dropped. Most tickets need no
`--class`: text is what the plain shells already serve.

**Repeatable `--blocked-by <n>` writes the prerequisites as native graph edges** — the only triage
route to them, and where an ordering belongs. Pass one per issue this one waits on
(`--blocked-by 5 --blocked-by 6`); the verb resolves each target's internal id, skips the edges
already live so a re-run is safe, and reads the whole set back as the machine line's last column. A
target that does not exist refuses on `7` before any label is written, and a target that is a **pull
request** refuses on `21` — the graph names a blocking PR by the issue its merge closes, so pass
that issue's number. This is the escape step 6's `20` names, so an ordered slice set is stamped
edges-first and its rewrite then passes.

**That last column reports this run, not the graph.** It is empty on every call that passed no
`--blocked-by`, whatever the issue actually waits on, because the verb reads the dependency endpoint
only when the flag is there. Read prerequisites with `fabrika build eligible <n>`, never off an empty
column here.

Which facets this verb owns and may remove, and the label
vocabulary it treats as a precondition, are its own sections
(`fabrika wire doc-section --heading "triage apply" < <skill-base>/contract.md`, then
`--heading "The owned facets — what apply may remove"`).

**`--ready-for` is a different question from readiness.** `status:triaged` says the ticket is ready;
`ready-for:` says ready *for whom*. Send it to `agent` when the work is specified well enough to
execute cold; to `human` when the deliverable is a judgment — a `type:decision`, an authoring brief,
anything resting on a product call nobody has made. Get it wrong and a document written for a human
lands in a builder's candidate pool.

**A `type:decision` goes to `agent` when the choice is already recorded on it.** Send it there when
the issue carries a founder ruling comment that made the call: the deliverable is then transcription
— write that ruling into the ADR or amendment it names — and transcription executes cold. This is
the stamp `build`'s citation arm reads; without it the arm is unreachable and the ruling costs
another human round-trip. No such comment, and the default above stands: `human`. You cite the
comment rather than judging the question settled yourself, and a ruling that left a gap open is
still a judgment, so it stays `human`. An issue already parked on `human` needs no triage re-run to
come back:
`fabrika decision rule <n>` is how a control-plane account records the ruling and flips the audience —
`--cites <url>` over a comment that is already there, `--authorization <file>` over a ruling given in
conversation — and its contract is that verb's `--help`, not this page.

**`--ready-for agent` requires a criteria block on every type but `epic`.** The verb reads the live
body through the same wire reader every grader downstream reads, and refuses on `16` — writing no
label — when the block is absent or malformed: that label promises a builder can pick the issue up
cold, and the block is what the promise is made of. Author one back in step 6 and re-stamp; a level
drift is `triage repair-criteria`'s. `--type epic` is exempt because an epic's criteria arrive per
child from the plan ledger, and `--ready-for human` is never asked for one.

**`--type epic --ready-for agent` writes no audience label, and that is not a failure.** On an epic
`ready-for:agent` is `check-epic-plan`'s statement that the plan floor came back clean, so the gate
is its only writer: the verb stamps the type, the priority, `status:triaged` and the home, prints
`none` in the ready-for column with a stderr line naming the gate, and leaves the epic
un-pickable until it is gated. Stamp it anyway — that is the correct triaged shape for an epic, and
`--ready-for human` is what parks one for a person instead.

**Do not assert control-plane scope.** `fabrika ship scope` routes it and CODEOWNERS enforces it at merge;
asserting it here routes a lane around an approval that never fires.

Done when the verb read back exactly one `type:`, one `p`, `status:triaged`, a `ready-for:` (none on
an epic sent to `agent`), a home, and every `--blocked-by` edge you asked for.

**A feature you linked to a ruling in step 6 has one more read, and it comes after the stamp.** The
guard reports an issue without `status:triaged` as out of scope, so it can only answer now:

```bash
fabrika guard pitch-guard check --issue $issue_number
```

Done when it lists the feature with its ruling. On a red, the report names the check the ruling
missed, and the guard's contract lists each check
(`fabrika wire doc-section --heading "pitch-guard check" < <plugin-root>/docs/guard-contract.md`).
Go back to step 6 and draft the pitch that feature still owes.

## 8 — The two outcomes that are not "triaged"

```bash
fabrika triage provenance $issue_number
```

Provenance decides what may be closed, and it has **two agent signals**: the `Filed by an agent`
footer, or an author in the operator set `$FABRIKA_OPERATOR_ACCOUNTS` names — the operator's own
filing is agent-reported footer or not, because footer-absence there is the emitter gap, not a human
author. Footer-absence from anyone else is still human-owned. How each signal is read, and what the
verb refuses to infer, is its section
(`fabrika wire doc-section --heading "triage provenance" < <skill-base>/contract.md`).

- **`human`** you cannot act on → park it; it leaves the queue on `status:needs-info`, **never
  closed**. When in doubt treat it as human: ignoring a person costs more than a cheap agent issue.
  The park note's stdin grammar and the facets the verb removes are its section
  (`fabrika wire doc-section --heading "triage park" < <skill-base>/contract.md`).

```bash
fabrika triage park $issue_number --token <claim-token> <<'EOF'
…
EOF
```

- **`agent`** and unsalvageable, duplicate, or failing the value bar below → kill it, which closes it
  not-planned carrying `closed-by-triage` and no triage status label — the verb strips the status it
  arrived on, so you never hand-delete `status:needs-triage` after a kill. **`--confirm` is you attesting that salvage was genuinely
  attempted**: a human-invoked `/report` carries the same agent footer, so footer presence alone
  never licenses a close. Killing a duplicate takes `--duplicate-of <survivor>`, which folds this
  issue's content into that one before closing; without it the content is simply lost. What the fold
  copies and what closing writes is the verb's section
  (`fabrika wire doc-section --heading "triage kill" < <skill-base>/contract.md`).
  **A kill closes the issue and never touches a lane.** Where the killed issue had a lane booted on
  it, that ledger stays owed until its driver records the cancellation terminal with
  `fabrika lane settle <lane>` — that is `operate`'s step, not yours, and hand-deleting the lane
  directory is not the protocol.

```bash
fabrika triage kill $issue_number --confirm --duplicate-of 8 --token <claim-token> <<'EOF'
…

**The value bar.** An issue can be correct, well-written, and still worth nothing. This is the bar
the founder's own backlog sweeps run on, and it kills an agent-filed issue when any one of five
clauses holds (each clause's token is what an audit's KILL row names):

- **process ceremony** (`process-ceremony`) — the deliverable is a record nobody then acts on, a decision written down for
  its own sake;
- **self-generated churn** (`self-generated-churn`) — refactor or build work we filed against our own output with no behaviour
  change: restated vocabulary, a duplicated list tidied, a docblock or sample-transcript nit, a doc
  sentence that omits one clause of a check that already works;
- **hardening with no incident** (`hardening-with-no-incident`) — *has this ever failed in production?* This clause is a factual
  test, not a taste call, and a "no" kills it. A missing unit test for a refusal that already works
  is this clause; so is nice-to-have telemetry or cost reporting for a cost nobody is paying;
- **superseded** (`superseded`) — something already landed, or already ruled, makes it moot;
- **duplicate of its parent** (`duplicate-of-parent`) — the parent's scope already covers it.

Those examples are verdicts, not hypotheticals: one sweep killed twelve of thirty-five triaged
`p2`s, and every one of them landed in a clause above. The bar reaches agent-filed work only
— **a human filing is parked, never killed**, however cleanly it fits a clause, with one exception:
a `--duplicate-of` fold closes it whatever its provenance, because a fold moves the content into
the survivor instead of discarding it. Every other close of a human filing still refuses on `12`.

Done when the issue has left the queue by exactly one route.

## 9 — Say what you decided, in plain words

**Your closing message says what triage decided on the issue, in plain words**: its type, its
priority, and everything triage added or changed. That covers acceptance criteria you wrote or
appended, a priority you raised or lowered, a body you rewrote, a split, the home, and any issue it
now waits on. A label records the decision; the message is how the person learns it. Say each in an
everyday sentence, such as "This is a bug, priced p1, meaning it is worth pulling next", with the
label beside it only as the thing to search for.

Then the message ends with the two plain lines
[skill-conventions §15](../../docs/skill-conventions.md#a-closing-message-ends-in-two-plain-lines)
requires: what happened, and what the person does next, worded as that section says. Both are owed
on every way a run can end: a triaged issue, a park, a kill, a claim another run holds, and a verb
that refused. Where step 6's pitch ask applies, that ask with its four parts is what the person does
next. A sweep closes once, after its per-issue lines.

**Before you write that message, remove the worktree this run was given.** No lane cleans up after
a triager, so a tree you leave stays on disk. It is your last command on every way the run can end:
a triaged issue, a park, a kill, a claim another run holds, and a verb that refused.

```bash
fabrika lane leave
```

After `removed` the directory is gone, so run nothing else. Exit `74` kept the tree because it holds
work: repeat its path and reason from stderr in your closing message, and never remove it another
way. A run a person started in a checkout they work in skips this step. The whole rule is
[skill-conventions §17](../../docs/skill-conventions.md#a-shell-no-lane-holds-removes-the-worktree-it-was-given).
A sweep's own session runs it once, after its last per-issue line.

Done when the message ends on the two lines and names what triage decided: the type and the priority
where triage set them, and each change. A park, a kill, a claim another run holds and a verb that
refused can end with no type or priority set, and then the message owes neither.

## Sweeping the queue

```bash
fabrika triage queue
```

The queue holds every open `status:needs-triage` issue and every open issue carrying no label at
all, oldest first; a bare issue is triaged exactly like a labelled one.
**Only `empty` ends a sweep** — a proven-empty queue and a failed read are different answers, and
which is which is the verb's section
(`fabrika wire doc-section --heading "triage queue" < <skill-base>/contract.md`; the codes it shares
with every verb above are `--heading "The shared exit taxonomy"`). Then
report one line per issue: outcome, type, priority, home, audience, **repo-relative paths only**.

## Auditing already-triaged work

An audit judges issues that are already triaged against the value bar, and it is **read-only until a
human approves the kills**. The caller names the label the audit covers; there is no default.

```bash
fabrika triage audit-set --label <label> --json > <scratch>/set.json
```

That is the whole open set under the label, never truncated, and it refuses on `7` rather than
printing an empty set when the label does not exist. Keep the audit's files in your session's
scratch directory; their paths are machine-local and never go into an issue.

**Readers never write.** Fan out one read-only reader per issue. A reader reads the issue and the
code it names and returns exactly one verdict row, with one line of evidence:

- `KILL` — it fits a value-bar clause, and the row names that clause's token;
- `DECIDE` — keeping or killing it is a choice only a human can make;
- `KEEP` — it clears the bar.

A reader never claims, labels, comments or closes. Collect the rows into chunks, each carrying the
number of rows it holds as `declared`, and merge them:

```bash
fabrika triage audit-merge --input <scratch>/set.json --chunk <scratch>/a.json --chunk <scratch>/b.json
```

The row and chunk shapes are that verb's help. The merge refuses, printing nothing, when a chunk's
rows differ from its `declared` count (`23`), when one issue has two rows (`24`), or when the merged
issues are not the input set (`25`). **Never rebuild a missing row by hand**: send that issue back to
a reader. A rebuilt row is a verdict no reader gave.

**The KILL batch waits for human approval.** Show the merged KILL rows with their clauses and
evidence, and close nothing until a human approves the batch. Then close each approved issue one at
a time through the normal route in step 8: claim it, run `triage provenance`, and use `triage kill`
for an agent filing and `triage park` for a human filing, which is never killed. `DECIDE` rows go to
the human as questions, and `KEEP` rows are left alone.
