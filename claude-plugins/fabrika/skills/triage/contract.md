# `/triage` — derived CLI contract

**Skill:** [`triage`](SKILL.md) · **Date:** 2026-08-02

These verbs live in `packages/fabrika-cli/`, binary `fabrika`, grouped under a `triage` subcommand,
beside the `adr` and `report` groups already implemented there. The
[CLI interface convention](../../docs/cli-interface-convention.md) governs them; where this spec and
that doc disagree, the doc wins and this spec is the bug.

**`fabrika` calls the retired v1 pipeline CLI nowhere, and neither does the skill.** Every verb
below is implemented from scratch here. v1's tools and its 18 `scripts/` were read for their
semantics and their scars — each Grounding section names what the v1 counterpart gets wrong and what
this spec does instead — but no clause defers to one, and none is invoked. Two edges are sanctioned
and are not calls: a CI gate stays the authority on its own question, so this spec expects
`pitch-guard`'s answer rather than recomputing it; and where both programs must agree on the same
bytes, fabrika owns the wire format and the other side conforms by pinning fabrika's golden fixture
in a test — a shared format is pinned once and never reimplemented on both sides.

**Substrate.** These verbs are Effect CLI verbs on the `@effect/platform-node` seam already used by
the sibling groups; GitHub access per
[skill conventions §11, "GitHub access is REST, never GraphQL"](../../docs/skill-conventions.md).
Named here because `cli-interface-convention.md` states no substrate and a spec that leaves it open
makes the implementer guess.

## Verb inventory

| Verb | Purpose | Split test |
|---|---|---|
| `triage queue` | the claimable `status:needs-triage` queue plus every open issue with no label, with the counts it scanned | paginating a label query and separating a proven-empty queue from a failed read is mechanical; which issue to take is judgment |
| `triage claim` | take one lane's claim on one issue, proven by read-back | a marker write plus an earliest-claim tiebreak is a protocol, not a decision |
| `triage scratch` | the per-lane directory this lane's working files go under | keying a namespace on the claim nonce is mechanical; what the file holds is judgment |
| `triage provenance` | was this issue reported by an agent or hand-typed by a human | a structural marker test over a fetched body, plus a membership test over the configured operator set — an empty body fails closed to `human`, an unreadable one refuses rather than guessing; what to *do* about a human filing stays in the skill |
| `triage homes` | the assignable homes — open milestones joined to their ROADMAP rows, plus the standing lanes this repo declares AND carries the labels for, with every `active` campaign's milestone marked `running: p0/p1 or blocker` | the join, the open-milestone filter and reading the campaigns table are mechanical; picking which home fits, and whether an exception applies, is judgment |
| `triage split` | create one split child, once, keyed on the parent back-reference | idempotency keyed on a durable reference is mechanical; deciding a report *is* a bundle is judgment |
| `triage enrich` | replace the body with your rewrite — or, for an epic, your pitch — over a preserved, leak-redacted original | envelope assembly, redaction and read-back are mechanical; what the rewrite says is judgment |
| `triage apply` | apply the whole triaged transition — type, priority, audience, class, home — and read it back | closed-vocabulary validation and an atomic label envelope are mechanical; the classification is judgment |
| `triage park` | park a human-filed issue on `status:needs-info` with questions | the label swap and comment are mechanical; the questions are judgment |
| `triage kill` | close an agent-filed issue not-planned — or any issue being folded into a survivor with `--duplicate-of` — auditably, preserving a duplicate's content | the three-write envelope, the redacted fold and the human-filed refusal (which the fold lifts) are mechanical; the verdict is judgment |
| `triage audit-set` | the whole open issue set under one caller-named label — the input of a read-only backlog audit | a paginated, untruncated label read that refuses an absent label is mechanical; which label to audit is judgment |
| `triage audit-merge` | fold an audit's chunk results onto its input set, refusing a miscounted chunk, a doubled issue or a set that does not match | the row-shape decode and the three set checks are mechanical; each verdict is a reader's judgment |
| `triage sweep-homes` | clear the milestone on every double-marked triaged issue, keep its standing lane, and leave a trail; list the un-homed ones untouched | the guard's own verdict and the one-remedy clear are mechanical; homing an un-homed issue is judgment |

One existing verb gains one flag:

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| `report dedup` gains `--exclude <number>` | The [`/report` contract](../report/contract.md) deliberately omitted it — *"it exists for the triage seam, where the issue being deduped already exists and must not flag itself; this skill's dedup runs before its issue exists, so the flag would have zero callers."* This is that seam, and this is its first caller. Minting a second dedup verb here would duplicate a 200-line tokenizer to add one filter. |

### Considered and deliberately not derived

Each is a real proposal someone could make again, so it is recorded rather than left to be
re-litigated.

**These rejections are in the wrong place, and that is tracked debt rather than a choice.**
Conventions §7 puts them in a plugin-root `.out-of-scope/`, which does not exist for any fabrika
skill; bootstrapping it is corpus-wide work, this spec does not create the directory, and until it
exists every fabrika skill's rejections live inline like these.

- **A `triage homing-check` verb.** `homing-guard` is CI-enforced on `issues: [labeled, unlabeled,
  milestoned, demilestoned]` (`.github/workflows/homing-guard.yml`) — it fires on the exact label
  write `triage apply` makes. A fabrika copy could only agree redundantly or disagree with the
  enforced verdict. `apply` instead takes the home as a **required input**, so an un-homed
  `status:triaged` is unrepresentable rather than detected after the fact. That is a precondition,
  not a second verdict.
- **A `triage pitch-check` verb.** Same shape: `.github/workflows/pitch-guard.yml` fires on
  `issues: [labeled]` filtered to `status:triaged`. Worse, v1's wrapper *reds on its own expected
  case* — an unapproved pitch is the normal state of freshly-triaged work and resolves to
  `pass: false` → exit 1, so the happy path always looks like a failure. The skill drafts the pitch —
  into the body `triage enrich` writes — and lets the seam gate answer.
- **A `triage classify-cp` verb.** `fabrika ship scope` routes the control-plane question and CODEOWNERS
  enforces it at merge. A triage-side second opinion has a measured cost: a routing note once
  asserted the opposite of a settled ruling and a lane was planned around an approval that never
  fires. The skill states the expectation and asserts nothing.
- **A `triage release-claim` verb.** v1 needed one because its claim was an assignee and
  `write-code`'s picker skipped assigned issues. Audience now rides on `ready-for:`, so nothing
  about a claim blocks pickup, and the marker expires on a TTL (see `triage claim`). A verb whose
  whole body is one `DELETE` is the thin wrapper this group never mints.
- **A `triage milestone-hygiene` verb** (v1's 100%-open flag). Its answer is a board-hygiene signal
  for a human, not an input to triaging an issue; it belongs to a roadmap surface, not this skill.
- **A `resolve-repo` verb.** v1's exists only to feed hand-rolled `gh api` calls in the skill body.
  This skill has no such surface: repo resolution is a shared input on every verb below.

### The name collision with v1's `triage` — live while v1 stood, retired with it

**A skill named `triage` existed** at `claude-plugins/kampus-pipeline/skills/triage/` until the v1
plugin was retired; it was model-invoked, and its six triggers were
near-identical to this one's. The `/report` contract recorded the analogous collision as "dormant
only by configuration — `.claude/settings.json` has `"kampus-pipeline@kampus": false`". **That
reasoning did not hold.** `.claude/skills` was a symlink to `claude-plugins/kampus-pipeline/skills`,
so v1's skills loaded as *project-level* skills and the plugin toggle did not stop them: a live
session's roster carried both `adr` and `fabrika:adr`, and both `report` and `fabrika:report`.
Settled by holding the two skill sets in separate namespaces, so no loader ever resolves one bare
name to both.

What the measurement behind that ruling sharpens: the two never shared a name — the loader
namespaces plugin skills, so the bare `triage` was always v1's. What overlapped was the
**description**, and this pair's overlap was the corpus's worst (same plugin-relative role, nearly
identical triggers). So the stated mitigation was the right one, and it stays load-bearing as
description discipline even with the collision gone. Two things follow, and neither is optional:

- **This skill is model-invoked deliberately** (conventions §3): triage must fire when someone says
  "triage the queue" without naming a plugin, and other skills must be able to reach it. It therefore
  pays the context load, and the description is the discriminator — it names the audience label, the
  read-back, and the guardrail framing that v1's cannot.
- **Retiring v1's description is cutover work, not this brief's** — v1 is the frozen baseline. Until
  it happens the bare name resolves to v1 and this skill is reached as `/fabrika:triage`. Stated
  here so a reader meets it as a known state rather than a surprise.

### Nothing here recomputes an enforced answer

Every question this group answers is ungated. The three that *are* enforced — homing, pitch, and
control-plane membership — are listed above as deliberately underived, with the workflow file that
owns each. This spec computes no second verdict on any of them. `triage sweep-homes` acts on the
homing verdict by calling the guard's own decision function, so it adds a write, not a verdict.

### The `pitch-ruled` comment

Step 6 posts one comment on a parentless feature whose pitch a founder ruling covers. Its first line
is the [`pitch-ruling` wire format](../../docs/wire-formats.md#pitch-ruling), exactly:

```text
pitch-ruled: #<n> · ruling:https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<m>#issuecomment-<comment-id>
```

`<n>` is the feature the comment is posted on. The URL is the comment the ruling is written in: on
the feature itself for a desk ruling, where `<m>` is `<n>`, or on the issue the ruling was made on.
Anything below the first line is free prose. `fabrika wire emit --format pitch-ruling` composes the
line from `issue:` and `ruling:` on stdin, and `fabrika wire check --format pitch-ruling` proves a
written one.

**A comment that links the ruling in free prose does not pass the guard.** `pitch-guard` reads the
first line only, so a comment without it is no pointer and the feature reds as a missing pitch.

The comment points and the guard decides: this group computes no verdict on it. What the linked
ruling has to be, and what each red means, is in
[the guard's contract](../../docs/guard-contract.md#pitch-guard-check).

## Shared conventions

Stated once rather than repeated per block.

- **Answer channel: machine.** Stdout carries the answer and nothing else. Scope lines, refusal
  reasons, redaction notices and progress go to stderr.
- **The positive answer is a state word, never an absence.** Every verb's "nothing found" case prints
  a token. Empty stdout is byte-identical to a verb that never ran, and consuming it as a proven
  negative is the single most damaging defect class in v1: `split-guard` prints `#n` or nothing, and
  v1's caller reads stdout only — so a `gh` failure reads as "safe to create" and fires the twin the
  guard exists to prevent.
- **Common inputs.** `--repo <owner/name>` (default: `$CLAUDE_PIPELINE_REPO`, else
  `$GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, else the `origin` remote's `owner/name`); with none resolvable the verb exits
  1 rather than guessing. `--json` swaps the line grammar for one JSON object with the named keys.
- **Every list read paginates and reports its scanned count** on stderr. v1 lost home candidates past
  GitHub's default page of 30 and truncated the queue at 100 with no signal; a verdict driven by a
  silently truncated read is a verdict over unknown scope.
- **A non-zero exit is UNKNOWN.** No verb prints a partial or permissive answer on a non-zero exit.

### The shared exit taxonomy

**Every verb in this group allocates from one internal table**, so a code means one thing across *this group*.
That is a property of this group and not of `fabrika`, and the difference matters to anyone driving
more than one group: **repo-wide the same number does not mean the same thing.** `wire`'s `3` is
*the format's block is provably not in the artifact*, where `report`'s and this group's is *stdin was
read and held nothing*.

Where this group's codes overlap **`report`'s writing verbs** (`3`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`,
`10`, `11`) they match them **deliberately**, code for code, so a caller driving `report` and `triage`
in one sweep reads one meaning. This spec calls `report dedup` (the `--exclude` extension below), and
that verb reads from the same `report` table: `7` when `--label` is absent, `27`/`28` when the queue
or the search index could not be read.

**This matrix owns what a code *means*; the per-verb tables own what *triggers* it.** Every verb in
this group can return `0`, `1`, `126` and `127` with the meanings above, and each of the four is stated
**here and nowhere else** — the per-verb "Exit status" tables below enumerate only that verb's own
proven outcomes, `3` and up, phrased as that verb's trigger rather than as a restatement of the
meaning. The reason is a defect this spec already shipped once: an earlier revision restated every
code in all nine verb tables, and a `127` row added to the matrix reached only five of them. One fact
in ten places is nine chances to drift, so the fact has one place.

**`14` is allocated in code and missing from this matrix, and that is a known gap this spec does not
close.** `packages/fabrika-cli/src/triage/codes.ts` seats `UNREPAIRABLE = 14` for `triage
repair-criteria`, a tenth verb this document does not yet fully specify — it has no column above,
and its section below carries only the derivation moved out of its help. Writing its row here would
be guessing at a spec nobody has written, so `15`
takes the next free seat instead of compacting into `14`, and the gap is disclosed rather than
silently filled.

**`27` is `triage sweep-homes`'s, and it has no column above either.** That verb's section specifies
it fully, exit table included; widening this matrix by a column for one verb's one private code is
left to the pass that closes the `14` gap.

**`4` is a deliberate gap, not a free slot.** It held *"the target issue does not exist, or is not
readable"* — one code for a proven fact and an unknown at once, which is the exact fusion `7` and
`11` exist to prevent. Those two took the halves: **proven absent (404) → `7`, unreadable → `11`**.
`4` is left unallocated rather than compacted away, both because a gap is cheaper than a collision
and because it keeps the alignment with `report file`, where `4` is a body-section failure no verb
here performs.

**`7` is the fail-closed refusal over scope that is provably not there**: a read that succeeded and
returned nothing, a required label vocabulary that is absent, or a target issue that is **proven
absent or closed**. *Proven* is the operative word — a 404 is a fact about the repository, while an
unreachable GitHub is not a fact about anything.

That reading was checked against the shipped binary rather than against a document.
`fabrika report dedup --help` at `v0.1.0` states it "Exits … 7 (`--label` does not exist, so the queue
half would scan nothing)" — a zero-scope refusal. (The checked-in
[`/report` contract](../report/contract.md) lists only `0/1/3/4` for `dedup` and is therefore behind
its own implementation on this point; the binary is the authority, and the drift is noted in this
skill's handoff rather than silently copied.)

**`11` is `report`'s shipped `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN`**, and this spec matches it rather than inventing
a meaning: `packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/codes.ts` defines `PRECONDITION_UNKNOWN = 11` as *"a
precondition read failed, so nothing was written and no outcome is proven … It is not `8` — nothing
was attempted — and not `1`, which would fuse an unreachable GitHub with a bad flag."* `report file`
seats its label-set read there and `report note` its `getIssue` `Unknown`. Every verb here that reads
before it answers seats an unreadable read on it too. An earlier revision of this spec used `11` for
the human-filed refusal, colliding with the shipped meaning; those refusals moved to `12` and `13`.

**`8` and `9` are deliberately not `1`.** A create or PATCH that times out may or may not have
landed; seating that on `1` makes "GitHub refused the write" indistinguishable from "the binary is
broken", which is the verdict-versus-invocation collision the reserved range exists to prevent. Each
`8` message carries its recovery instruction, because a blind retry is how one split becomes two
children.

**`10` is the superset that keeps `report`'s reading true.** There it is `CLASSIFIED` — a title or
`--label` carrying a type or priority. Here it is *the supplied classification value is not permitted
in this position*: off the closed enum, or a `--home` naming a milestone that is not open. A closed
milestone is an off-vocabulary home, so it belongs with the enum refusals rather than with the shape
errors.

**`5` applies only to text the caller just wrote, never to content being preserved.** Authored text
is refusable because the author can fix it; foreign content being copied forward is **redacted
automatically**, because refusing it would strand the operation on somebody else's mistake. This
asymmetry is the whole of the leak design and it is stated once here.

**`5` and `6` are separate because their fixes are opposite**, exactly as in `report`. The caller loop
on a path refusal is *redact and re-send*; on a body that **is** a path, masking is a no-op and that
loop never terminates.

### Read-backs compare normalized text, not bytes

Every write verb re-reads its target and compares. The comparison is **normalized**, and the
normalization is not a description to re-derive — it is a shipped function:
**import `normalizeForReadback` from `packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/compose.ts`.** Naming the module
rather than the prose is deliberate, for the same reason the leak predicate is named below.

It does **three** things, in order, and all three are load-bearing:

1. line endings `\r\n` → `\n`;
2. per-line trailing `[ \t]+` stripped;
3. **every trailing newline stripped** (`.replace(/\n+$/, "")`).

Step 3 is the one a re-derivation drops, and dropping it fires exit `9` on clean runs:
`composeBody` in the same module emits a trailing `\n`, so the composed text and the body GitHub
returns differ by a newline that means nothing. GitHub is not documented to round-trip a body
byte-for-byte either, which is why this comparison is normalized at all; the implementer should
confirm the round-trip against the live API before tightening it.

### Machine-local path detection

`triage enrich`, `triage kill`, `triage split` and `triage park` share the leak predicate **already
implemented** at `packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/leaks.ts` — three structural shapes (home-relative
`~/`, absolute home root `/Users/<account>` and `/home/<account>`, and the temp roots `/tmp`,
`/private/tmp`, `/private/var`, `/var/folders`), no name list, each redacting to its class root, and
specified in full in the [`/report` contract](../report/contract.md). The same module's separate
bare-`@`-reference case — an authored body whose first non-whitespace run is an `@`-prefixed path —
is exit `6` on all four verbs, unredactable, because the fix is to send the body.

**Import that module; do not re-derive the predicate.** Naming the module rather than the document is
deliberate — a prose pointer is a deferral, and a second leak predicate that drifts from the first is
worse than either alone. The same applies to the dedup core at
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/dedup.ts`, which the `--exclude` extension modifies rather than
copies, and to `renderFooter` in `packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/compose.ts`, which `triage split`
imports to stamp its child.

## `triage queue`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika triage queue [--label <name>] [--limit <n>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--label` | string | no | `status:needs-triage` | the intake-queue label; the queue is its open issues plus every open issue carrying no label at all |
| `--limit` | integer | no | `100` | the maximum number of rows to print; must be ≥ 1 |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved (see Shared conventions) | the repository to read |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the full result object instead of the line grammar |

**Output** — machine channel. The first line is the outcome token alone: `queued` or `empty`. On
`queued`, one **tab-separated** line per issue follows — `<number>`, `<age-days>`, `<title>` — oldest
first, capped at `--limit`. The rows are the open issues carrying `--label` **and every open issue
carrying no label at all**, merged into one order; a row does not say which set it came from. `<age-days>` is a whole number of days from the issue's `created_at` to
now, floored.

With `--json`, one object with keys `outcome`, `issues` (array of `{number, ageDays, title}`, empty
unless `outcome` is `queued`), `scanned` (integer), and `truncated` (boolean).

Pull requests are excluded: GitHub's issues endpoint returns them, and v1's listers did not filter,
so a PR could appear as a triageable row.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | `--label` does not exist in the repository — the labelled read would scan nothing |
| `11` | the labelled read or the unlabeled read failed — the outcome is UNKNOWN, never `empty` |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `triage queue: cannot read the <label> queue in <repo>: <reason> — the outcome is UNKNOWN, never "empty".` | 11 | refusal |
| `triage queue: cannot read the open issues in <repo> that carry no label: <reason> — the outcome is UNKNOWN, never "empty".` | 11 | refusal |
| `triage queue: label <label> does not exist in <repo> — refusing to report an empty queue over zero scope. <remedy>` (`<remedy>` names the `fabrika status bootstrap <surface>` command that creates the label on this repo's board, says no surface creates it, or says which one is UNKNOWN when `.fabrika.jsonc` is refused) | 7 | refusal |
| `triage queue: --limit must be 1 or greater.` | 1 | usage error |

**Scope** — every open issue in `--repo` carrying `--label`, plus every open issue carrying no
label at all, both read with pagination. An issue filed with no label is otherwise one triage never
sees; the project's Inbox view is the human's view of the same set. The unlabeled read pages the
whole open list and keeps the bare rows, because the REST list has no "no label" filter and the
search index's `no:label` lags a fresh filing — and this read decides whether a sweep is done. **`empty` and a
failed read are different answers and never share a channel or a code.** The distinction is
load-bearing because the skill uses this verb as a sweep's termination test: a renamed label or a
scope-limited token returns HTTP 200 with `[]`, and v1 terminated the sweep on it and reported the
queue drained. The label's existence is checked against the repository's label set, so a typo reds on
`7` rather than answering `empty`. That check guards the labelled read only: the unlabeled read has
no label to prove, so its guard is the read itself, and a failure of it is `11` — never an empty half
of the queue. Two scope lines on stderr name the labelled and the unlabeled scanned counts on every
run.

The read is this verb's whole answer rather than a step toward a write, so its failure is `11` for
the same reason it is `11` everywhere else here: `1` would fuse an unreachable GitHub with a bad
flag, and this verb has a bad flag (`--limit`) sitting on `1` already.

**Examples**

**Grounding**

- A read whose scope is zero reds rather than answering. v1's `list-queue.sh` had no such check and
  its empty output *was* the sweep's termination test.
- v1 `list-queue.sh` prints `(.user.login)` on every row — the filer. A bare login on a queue row is
  not a provenance verdict: it takes the footer *and* the configured operator set to reach one, which
  is `triage provenance`'s job. This verb omits the column and defers to that verb.
- v1 paginated neither this read nor `list-open-milestones.sh`; the latter silently capped home
  candidates at GitHub's default 30 while "nothing fits" routed to a standing lane or a kill.

## `triage claim`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika triage claim 7 [--token <claim-token>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the issue number to claim |
| `--token` | string | no | mint a new lane | the token a previous claim handed THIS lane — re-enter it rather than minting a second |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. One line: `won\t<claim-token>`, or `lost\t<holder-session-id>`. **Both
are proven answers and both exit 0**, with the discriminator in the state word — the same
three-outcome shape `report dedup` already uses. A losing claim is something this verb *determined*,
not something that prevented it from answering, so seating it on a non-zero code would contradict the
shared rule that a non-zero exit is UNKNOWN and would make "another sweep holds it"
indistinguishable from "the verb is broken".

With `--json`, an object with keys `outcome` (`won` / `lost`), `session` (this session's id), `token`
(this lane's claim token), `holder` (the winning session id, `null` on `won`), `holderLane` (the
winning lane's nonce, `null` on `won` or when the winner is a marker predating the lane field),
`markers` (count of live markers considered), and `expired` (count discarded as older than the TTL).

**A claim names a lane, not a session.** One fan-out runs several triagers under one session id, so
a marker stamped with the session alone cannot tell two of them apart: two siblings once each read
the other's marker back as their own, both answered `won`, and both wrote the issue. The lane is a
token, `triage:<session-id>:<uuid>` — the same shape and the same nonce rule the `build` namespace
resolves ownership by, in its own namespace so the two never collide. A run with no `--token` mints
one and races under its nonce; a run that passes the token it was handed re-enters the lane it
already holds.

**The marker literal.** A claim is one issue comment whose body is exactly:

```
<!-- fabrika-triage-claim session=<session-id> lane=<nonce> -->
```

One line, no surrounding prose, so a marker is matched by an exact prefix rather than by parsing
human text. `<session-id>` is this run's session id — `FABRIKA_SESSION_ID`, else
`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, else `PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_SESSION`; `<nonce>` is the first
8 hex of the claim token's UUID. Any comment not matching that prefix is not a marker and is ignored.
A marker carrying no `lane=` field predates the lane field: it is counted, it ages out on the same
TTL, and every lane reads it as **another** claimant's — never as its own.

**The ordering key is the comment's `created_at` as returned by GitHub**, never a timestamp embedded
in the marker text: the body is caller-supplied and a caller could backdate itself into winning every
race. "Older than the TTL" is measured against that same `created_at`. Earliest surviving marker
wins.

**The TTL is a fixed 60 minutes and there is no flag for it.** A marker carries no TTL of its own, so
the session that ages it out is never the session that placed it: `--ttl-minutes 240` posted a claim
its placer thought bound for four hours and the five mutating verbs stopped honouring at one — the
fail-open direction the guard exists to close. One constant is the only reading, for placer and
reader alike; widening the window means changing that constant.

**The claim is a session-stamped comment, never the assignee.** Every agent authenticates as the same
login, so the assignee field cannot discriminate two concurrent sweeps — it is a shared availability
slot (v1's own `claim-assign.ts` says as much: *"every agent authenticates as the same
login, so the assignee is one shared slot"*). The session id comes from `FABRIKA_SESSION_ID`, else
`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, else `PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_SESSION`; with all three unset the verb exits `1`
rather than posting an unattributable marker.

**Resolution.** Post this session's marker, re-read all markers on the issue, discard any older than
the TTL, and the **earliest surviving marker wins**. `won` requires a positive proof that the
winner is this session; every unresolvable state answers `lost`, never `won`.

**The comment list the resolution runs over is reconciled before it is resolved.** The rule above is
only as good as the set it is handed, and on 2026-09-05 the set was wrong: a claim read one comment,
did not see a marker that had been live for three minutes, and printed `won` for a lane that had
already lost. GitHub documents no read-after-write guarantee for the REST API and no
cache-bypass directive — its best-practices page offers only `etag`/`last-modified` conditional
requests, whose answer is "unchanged since the value *you* saved", which says nothing about a write
another lane made ([GitHub, "Best practices for using the REST
API"](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28)).
So consistency is proven rather than requested: the list is read first, the issue's own `comments`
count second, and a list shorter than that later count provably missed something. A shortfall is
re-read on a short backoff, and one that survives every attempt is exit `11` carrying
`received <k> of <m> declared comment(s)` — never a shorter list resolved anyway. A list *longer*
than the count is not fenced: a comment deleted between the two reads produces it, and extra markers
can only make the resolution more cautious. Bounds are `FABRIKA_COMMENT_SCAN_ATTEMPTS` (default 3)
and `FABRIKA_COMMENT_SCAN_DELAY_MS` (default 500).

**The claim binds, and every mutating verb is what makes it bind.** `split`, `enrich`, `apply`,
`park` and `kill` each re-read the markers on their target immediately before their first write, and
refuse on `17` when a live one names another claimant — the check reuses this verb's own reader and
resolver, so there is one marker grammar. Those five decide foreignness on the **session+lane
pair**, the same identity `claim` resolves on: each takes the optional `--token` this verb handed
the lane, and a same-session marker under a different nonce is somebody else's. A call that passes
no `--token` cannot say which lane it is, so it is priced fail-closed on exactly that: it passes
while its session's live markers all name one lane, and refuses on `17` once two lanes of its
session hold live markers. Holding **no** marker still passes: an unclaimed issue is the ordinary
first-triage case, and demanding one would refuse every existing caller. **That re-read is the same
reconciled read `claim` resolves over**, so a comment list the issue's own count proves short refuses
this gate on `11` rather than passing it as "nobody else holds it" — a stale list hides a live
competitor on both sides of the claim, and fixing only the claim would have left the exit-`17` gate
reading the same wrong set. The same re-read refuses a
closed target on `7`, and a comment read that fails is `11`. A `--token` that will not parse as
`triage:<session-id>:<uuid>`, or that carries a session other than the one running, is a usage error
on `1` on all five — the same two lines `claim` itself prints, verbatim, since it is the same
reader; a lane names itself, never another. Before, the protocol was advisory at exactly the point
it needed to bite: a session that had read `lost` once ran `enrich` anyway and replaced the winner's
authored body. There is no override flag — nothing in that incident needed one, and a flag added
before a real need is a flag agents learn to pass reflexively.

**The marker has a lifecycle, and both ends of it are specified.** This is the one verb here that
*is* a race protocol, so leaving either end to an implementer's judgment would let the protocol
create the race it exists to resolve. Every other write verb states its idempotency; so does this one.

- **A losing claim deletes the marker it just posted**, before printing `lost` —
  `DELETE /repos/{repo}/issues/comments/{id}` on its own comment id, and only that id. Litter left
  behind survives the full TTL and its `created_at` is *older* than every marker posted after it, so
  a session that already conceded can beat a rightful winner on a later run. The delete is what keeps
  "earliest surviving marker" a statement about live claimants.
- **A failed deletion is `9`, not `0`.** The write landed, the intended end state (no marker of mine)
  is not what the issue carries, and the caller has to know a stale marker of theirs is sitting on
  the issue. Answering `lost` at exit 0 would hide it until it won a race nobody was running.
- **A lane that already holds a live marker on the issue re-reads and re-resolves rather than
  posting a second.** A second marker under the same nonce cannot win anything the first did not —
  it is strictly later — so posting it only adds litter to clean up. Re-running this verb under the
  `--token` it was handed is therefore idempotent: the same marker, re-resolved. Re-running it
  *without* the token is not a re-entry at all — it is a new lane, and it races like one.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the issue is proven absent (404), or is closed — nothing to claim |
| `8` | the marker `POST` failed — UNKNOWN whether a marker landed |
| `9` | the marker was posted but the read-back does not find it, or a conceded marker could not be deleted |
| `11` | the issue or its comment list could not be read — no claim was resolved |

`6` is unreachable here: this verb reads no stdin, so it has no authored text to be a bare `@`
reference. It was allocated to `lost` in an earlier draft, which put an answer on stdout at a
non-zero exit — that is why `lost` exits 0, and why the code now belongs to the shared leak pair
rather than to this verb.

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |

**Scope** — the issue's comments, paginated, filtered to the marker prefix. A comment read that fails
is exit `11`; it never degrades to `won`. Session ids are printed **in full** on both channels — there
is no abbreviation rule — because a truncated id cannot be compared against this run's session id
by a caller.

**Examples**

```

```

**Grounding**

- v1 `claim-issue.sh:29` reads `ME=$(gh api user --jq '.login')` unguarded. With a broken token `ME`
  is empty, every comparison against it is `"" = ""` → true, and the script prints `claim: won` and
  **exits 0** — a fail-open claim on a token that cannot write. `won` here requires positive proof.
- v1 `claim-issue.sh:35-36` cannot distinguish "unassigned" from "the read failed": both are the
  empty string, and the empty string means free-to-claim.
- v1 `claim-issue.sh:51` `DELETE`s other accounts' assignments, so a human self-assigning inside the
  race window loses it to a string comparison. This verb writes only its own marker and deletes only
  its own marker — never another session's, and never on a win.
- Audience moved to `ready-for:`, so a claim no longer has to be released to keep an issue pickable.
  The TTL replaces v1's mandatory release, whose script swallowed every error (`2>/dev/null ||
  true`) and could silently leave an issue unpickable forever.

## `triage scratch`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika triage scratch 7 --slug authored --token <claim-token> [--repo <owner/name>]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the issue this lane holds the claim on |
| `--slug` | string | yes | — | the file's leaf name: kebab-case, ≤5 words, no path separators |
| `--token` | string | yes | — | the token `triage claim` handed THIS lane — what keys the namespace |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |

**Output** — machine channel. One absolute path:
`<temp root>/fabrika-triage/<session-id>/<issue>-<claim-nonce>/<slug>`. The directory is created if
absent, so the path is writable the moment it is printed; the leaf itself is not created. There is no
`--json`: the answer is one path, and an object around it would carry nothing the path does not.

**The claim nonce is in the key, and that is the whole verb.** A fan-out of triagers runs under one
session id, so a namespace keyed on the session alone hands every lane the same
directory — and a working file under a fixed name like `authored.md` then overwrites a sibling's
silently. That happened across three lanes of one drain and was caught only because the clobbered
content happened to be a different issue's body; the failure it points at is one issue's authored
body posted onto another. Keying on the lane makes the collision unconstructible rather than
detectable, exactly as `build scratch` already does for build lanes. The nonce is read off the token
the **caller** holds, never off the winning marker — that string is the same for two lanes of one
session, which is how keying on it re-opens the hole it closed.

**Holding the claim is a precondition here, unlike everywhere else in this group.** The five mutating
verbs pass when nobody holds a claim, because an unclaimed issue is the ordinary first-triage case.
A scratch path *is* the lane, so a caller that cannot prove one has nothing to be allocated a
directory under: no live marker of this lane, or a marker that lost the race to a sibling, is exit
`19` and no path on stdout.

**The printed path is machine-local and must never reach a posted artifact.** `enrich`, `split`,
`park` and `kill` red on it (`5`) — the temp roots it lives under are three of the leak predicate's
structural shapes.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `10` | `--slug` carries a path separator, or is not a kebab-case leaf |
| `11` | the issue's comment list could not be read or reconciled, or its markers could not be ordered — the claim is UNKNOWN |
| `19` | proven: this lane holds no live claim on the issue |

`1` additionally covers the two identity refusals and the allocation failure, as the errors table
below states. `7`, `8` and `9` are unreachable: this verb writes nothing to GitHub, so it has no
write to fail and no read-back to mismatch. It does read the issue record — that is where the
reconciled comment read takes the count it divides by — but an absent or unreadable one is folded
into the comment read's own refusal on `11`, never seated on `7` here.

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `triage scratch: --slug "<s>" must be a kebab-case leaf, no path separators.` | 10 | refusal |
| `triage scratch: no session id is set — FABRIKA_SESSION_ID, CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID, PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_SESSION are all unset — refusing to key a scratch namespace on an unattributable session.` | 1 | refusal |

| `triage scratch: #<n> is held by the lane on nonce <nonce>, not by this one — back off.` | 19 | refusal |
| `triage scratch: cannot create <dir>: <reason>` | 1 | refusal |

**Scope** — the issue's comments, paginated, filtered to the marker prefix, with the scanned count on
stderr like every other read in this group.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika triage scratch 7 --slug authored --token triage:b2e1-…:5f1c9a20-…
triage scratch: scanned 3 comments in <owner>/<repo>.
/var/folders/xy/T/fabrika-triage/b2e1-…/7-5f1c9a20/authored
```

A sibling lane of the same session, on the same issue and the same slug, is handed a different
directory — which is the property the verb exists for:

```
$ fabrika triage scratch 7 --slug authored --token triage:b2e1-…:7c3d0e91-…
/var/folders/xy/T/fabrika-triage/b2e1-…/7-7c3d0e91/authored
```

```
$ fabrika triage scratch 7 --slug authored --token triage:b2e1-…:5f1c9a20-…
triage scratch: this lane holds no live claim on #7 — run `fabrika triage claim 7` and act only on `won`.
$ echo $?
19
```

**Grounding**

- `packages/fabrika-cli/src/build/scratch-verb.ts` — the same allocator for build lanes, whose
  docblock records the five clobbers session-only keying cost.
- The `build` skill makes its path the only sanctioned one ("Scratch files go only where this
  prints"); this verb is what lets the triage skill say the same thing.

## `triage provenance`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika triage provenance 7 [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the issue number to inspect |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. One line: `agent` or `human`. With `--json`, an object with keys
`outcome`, `marker` (boolean — was the agent footer present), `operator` (boolean — was the author a
configured operator account), and `reason`. `marker` and `operator` stay separate fields because
they are separate facts: an `agent` answer with `marker: false` is the ruling below firing, and a
caller chasing the emitter gap needs to see which one decided.

**Two agent signals, and the second one is config-bound.** The footer became the signal because
every filing showed the same account, so authorship carried no information. A later founder ruling
narrows that: a filing authored by an account in the **operator set** is agent-reported whether or
not the footer is present, because footer-absence there reflects a gap in the emitter, not a human
author. Footer-absence from **any other author** is unchanged — still human-owned, and never
auto-closed except by a `triage kill --duplicate-of` fold, which is licensed whatever the
provenance.

**The operator set is an input, resolved from `$FABRIKA_OPERATOR_ACCOUNTS`** (comma- or
whitespace-separated logins, a leading `@` tolerated, compared case-insensitively). It is a *set*
rather than one account because the operator runs more than one, and it is configuration rather than
a literal in source because a GitHub handle baked into a released package is an operator identity
leaking into a shared artifact — and a set nobody can widen without a release. **Unset or
blank yields the empty set**, which reduces the verb to the footer-only rule: a missing config
can never make a filing newly close-eligible.

**The footer's shape, from the emitter.** `report file` composes it with `renderFooter`
(`packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/compose.ts`), which emits `` `---\n<sub>` `` then the present fields
joined with ` · ` then `</sub>`. Two fields are always there — the literal `Filed by an agent` first,
and a UTC timestamp last, un-backticked. Three are droppable — `` session `x` ``, `` model `x` ``,
`` branch `x` `` — and **a dropped field takes its ` · ` separator with it**, so a sparse footer is
still a footer and this verb must not require any of the three.

**This verb matches a line beginning `<sub>Filed by an agent`, and that deliberately diverges from
`report`'s own check.** The shipped detection in `packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/file-verb.ts` is
the bare substring `issue.body.includes("Filed by an agent")` — not line-anchored. That is correct
*there*: it is a read-back over a body the same process just composed, so nothing else can be in it.
Here the body is foreign, and a bare substring fails **open toward `agent`** — an issue that merely
*quotes* the phrase (a bug report about the footer, a pasted body, a discussion of the rule itself)
would answer `agent`, and `agent` is the close-eligible direction. Anchoring to the emitted line
shape makes the failure land on `human`, which is the protected one. The divergence is stated so a
later reader does not "fix" it back into agreement.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the issue is proven absent (404) — there is no body to test |
| `11` | the issue could not be read — the outcome is UNKNOWN, never `human` |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `triage provenance: issue #<n> not found in <repo>.` | 7 | refusal |
| `triage provenance: cannot read #<n> in <repo>: <reason> — the provenance is UNKNOWN; refusing to default it.` | 11 | refusal |
| `triage provenance: #<n> has an empty body — answering human (fail-closed).` | 0 | notice |
| `triage provenance: #<n> in <repo> — the author is a configured operator account, so the filing is agent-reported whether or not the footer is present.` | 0 | notice |

**Scope** — one issue's body and its author login, read as typed JSON rather than through
`jq -r .body`, which errors on the unescaped control characters GitHub issue bodies carry and yields
empty in a loop. A payload carrying no author reads as the empty login, which is never a member of
the operator set — so an unreadable author degrades to the footer-only rule, the protected direction.

**A present-but-empty body answers `human`; an unreadable one refuses.** Those are different facts
and this verb keeps them apart. An empty body is a measurement: the body is there, it carries no
footer, and the protective reading of "no footer" is `human`, because the only irreversible act
downstream is a kill. The author is tested **first**, so an operator's empty-bodied filing answers
`agent` — the ruling is about who filed it, not how much it says, and `--confirm` is still the guard
on the close. The stderr notice says the answer was defaulted, so a caller can tell a
measured `human` from a fail-closed one. An **unreadable** body is not a measurement at all, and
answering `human` over it would be a verdict manufactured from a failed read — the same fusion the
`7`/`11` split exists to prevent. The protection survives either way: `triage kill` refuses on a
`human` verdict *and* refuses on an unreadable body, and now says which happened.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika triage provenance 7
agent
```

```
$ fabrika triage provenance 8
human
```

```
$ fabrika triage provenance 7 --json
{"outcome":"agent","marker":true,"operator":false,"reason":"the 'Filed by an agent' marker is present in the body"}
```

```
$ FABRIKA_OPERATOR_ACCOUNTS=<operator-login> fabrika triage provenance 1
agent
```

**Grounding**

- Filing provenance, not authorship, is the signal. Its premise, that authorship is unusable
  because every filing shows one shared account, is what the operator-set ruling narrows: the
  operator's own account is now a *positive* agent signal, and only that account.
- That founder ruling — an issue filed under the operator's own account is agent-reported and
  close-eligible, footer or no footer; unchanged for a genuine third-party human filing. It settles
  a live cost: filings were parked at `status:needs-info` on footer-absence alone and then closed by
  hand anyway.
- v1 has **no tool for this at all**: "never close a human-filed issue" is 48 lines of prose across
  `SKILL.md` and `close-not-planned.md`, with nothing computing it, while `list-queue.sh` puts the
  meaningless filer login in front of the agent on every row. The highest-stakes, least-reversible
  decision in the skill had the least support.
- `triage kill` re-checks this itself rather than trusting a caller to have run it — the guard is
  structural, not a caller's discipline.

Unflagged, the verb resolves the declared path first; a `.fabrika.jsonc` it could not read refuses `11` rather than falling back to the shipped name |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

There is no lane flag: the lane set is `boardVocabulary.standingLanes` in `.fabrika.jsonc`, and a
config that could not be read or decoded refuses `11` on the same terms as `roadmapFile`.

**Output** — machine channel. The first line is the outcome token `homes`. Then one tab-separated
line per candidate — `<kind>`, `<key>`, `<label-or-title>` — where `<kind>` is `milestone` or `lane`.
A `milestone` row's `<key>` is its **number** (the value `triage apply --home` takes) and its third
column is the milestone title; a `lane` row's `<key>` is its label name and its third column is the
fixed meaning string `a standing lane this repo declares`, verbatim, for every lane.

**No lane has a meaning of its own here.** The string is one constant rather than the repo's live
label description, so a description edit cannot change a machine-channel answer — and no source this
verb reads can gloss a lane a repo declared, so the column says that instead of inventing one.

Milestone rows come first, ordered by number, then the lanes in the order the config declares them.

With `--json`, an object with keys `outcome`, `milestones` (array of `{number, title, roadmapRow}`),
`lanes` (array of `{label, meaning}`), and `scanned`.

**Every `active` campaign's milestone is marked `running`.** That campaign is closed to new intake
unless the work is `p0` or `p1`, or blocks one of that milestone's own in-flight lanes, so
its row carries a fourth tab-separated column, verbatim `running: p0/p1 or blocker`, and its `--json`
object carries `"running": "running: p0/p1 or blocker"` as a fourth key — one constant behind both
channels, so the marker reads the same either way. Every other row is unchanged on both channels — no
fourth column, and no `running` key — so a reader written against the pre-marker shape still parses.
A marked milestone is still listed: the two exceptions are real work, and a removed row cannot
carry them. This verb states the subtraction and stops; where excluded work goes instead is the
caller's by-fit judgement, and no output here names a destination.

**Which milestone is running is data, never a literal in this spec or in the verb.** It is the
`State` column of `ROADMAP.md`'s `## Campaigns` table, read through the strict campaigns parser, off
the roadmap text this verb has already read for the arc join. It narrows what triage homes on a
milestone and refuses no lane. Moving to the next campaign is a `ROADMAP.md` edit and never a code or
skill edit; `--roadmap` moves both reads together. The table's three states:

| `## Campaigns` | Rows marked | stderr |
|---|---|---|
| one or more rows are `active` | every `active` campaign's milestone row, if it is open | `triage homes: campaigns: 1 active — <name> (#<n>).` — or, for N > 1, `triage homes: campaigns: <n> active — <name> (#<a>), <name> (#<b>).` |
| absent, empty, or every row `paused`/`done` | none — the answer is exactly the pre-marker one | `triage homes: campaigns: none active.` |
| reads but does not parse | none | `triage homes: campaigns: unreadable — <reason>.` |

A malformed table is **never** rendered as "no milestone is running", and it does not refuse: a home
list is still the right answer, and the stderr line is where the defect is named. An `active` campaign
pinning a milestone that is closed or absent from the open set marks no row and passes.

**Only open milestones appear, and each is joined to its roadmap arc/campaign row.** `roadmapRow` is
`null` for an open milestone no roadmap row pins, which is itself a signal worth seeing rather than a
row to hide.

**A lane row is offered only where this repo BOTH declares the lane and carries its label.** The
declared set is `boardVocabulary.standingLanes` in `.fabrika.jsonc`, and config is its only source:
nothing is shipped for it. The verb then reads the repo's own label set and drops every declared
lane the board does not carry. Both halves are load-bearing. A declaration alone is a name the
config asserts and the board may not carry yet — offered anyway, a triager takes it, classifies the
whole issue, and only then hits a failed label write naming a label rather than the real cause. So
the presence read is the same evidence the later `triage apply --lane` write depends on, taken
before the menu is printed rather than after the work is done.

**A repo that declares no lanes runs none.** An absent `standingLanes` key and `"standingLanes": []`
are one declaration: the verb reads no labels at all — there is nothing to filter — and prints no
lane row. The empty list is the one explicitly-empty `boardVocabulary` sub-key that decodes rather
than refusing: the other four turn a gate off, while zero lanes turns nothing off and says every
issue homes on a milestone. `triage apply --lane` refuses over that set on `10`, naming the key
rather than enumerating nothing.

Neither case is a refusal: a home list over milestones alone is the right answer, and stderr carries
which lanes were declared and which of them the board carries:

| Declared set | stderr |
|---|---|
| absent or empty | `triage homes: standing lanes: this repo declares none.` |
| all present | `triage homes: standing lanes: 2 of 2 declared carry a label in <repo>.` |
| some absent | `triage homes: standing lanes: 0 of 2 declared carry a label in <repo> — not offered: <lane>, <lane>.` |

The dropped labels are named, not merely counted: the gap between what the config asserts and what
the board carries is the defect, and a bare `0 of 2` sends the reader back to the config to find out
which names it meant.

**An unreadable label list is `11`, never "this repo has no lanes."** That reading silently shortens
the menu, which is the failure this whole surface is built against — a caller cannot tell a repo with
no lanes from a repo it could not look at.

**The join, stated rather than left to the implementer** — this is the verb's whole split test, so it
is the one thing that must not be inferred. `ROADMAP.md`'s `## Arcs` and `## Campaigns` tables are
`| <name> | <milestone> | <state> |`, where the milestone cell is `#<number>` — the same
row-to-milestone-by-number binding `roadmap-guard` already enforces. So: **the join key is that
`#<number>` matched against the milestone's number, never the title**, and `roadmapRow` is the row's
**first column** — the arc or campaign name. The `State` column is not read: this verb reports what
exists, and whether an arc is active is a question for the caller, not a filter here. A milestone no
row pins yields `null`; a row pinning a milestone that is closed or absent contributes nothing.

Matching on the title would be the obvious shortcut and it is wrong — an arc named `Gateway` pins a
milestone titled `Search and discovery`, and the two share no substring.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the repository has zero open milestones, **or the roadmap parsed to zero arc rows** — zero scope |
| `11` | the milestone list, the repo's label set, the roadmap file or `.fabrika.jsonc` could not be read — the outcome is UNKNOWN |

A malformed `## Campaigns` table is not on this table: it marks no row and names itself on stderr.
The marker is an annotation on an answer this verb can give without it, so refusing over one would
withhold the home list a triager needs.

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `triage homes: cannot read milestones in <repo>: <reason> — the home list is UNKNOWN, never empty.` | 11 | refusal |
| `triage homes: cannot read the labels in <repo>: <reason> — which standing lanes this board accepts is UNKNOWN, never none.` | 11 | refusal |
| `triage homes: .fabrika.jsonc is refused — <reason>, so which standing lanes this repo runs is unread; the homes list is UNKNOWN, never short.` | 11 | refusal |
| `triage homes: cannot probe the roadmap at <path>: <reason> — the home list is UNKNOWN, never empty.` | 11 | refusal |
| `triage homes: cannot read the roadmap at <path>: <reason> — the home list is UNKNOWN, never empty.` | 11 | refusal |
| `triage homes: <repo> has 0 open milestones — refusing to answer, since "no home exists" routes to a kill.` | 7 | refusal |
| `triage homes: the roadmap at <path> parsed to 0 arc rows — the table grammar changed or the file is truncated; refusing to answer over an unjoinable roadmap.` | 7 | refusal |

**Both "cannot read" cases are `11`, not `1`.** They were `1` in an earlier revision, which fused an
unreachable GitHub and an unreadable file with a mistyped flag — and this verb's answer feeds a
routing decision whose fallback is a kill. A caller that cannot tell "no homes" from "I could not
look" will route work irreversibly on the second one.

**A readable roadmap that yields zero arc rows is a failed parse, not a repo with no arcs.**
The grammar is a table this verb does not own, so a grammar change silently empties the join; reading
that as "no homes exist" would route work to a kill. Zero *campaign* rows is a legitimate state and
passes.

**An ABSENT roadmap is an answer, not either refusal.** A file that is proven not to exist is
a proven negative — the join is simply empty — so every open milestone lists with `roadmapRow: null`,
any standing lane the board carries lists beside them, and stderr carries
`triage homes: no roadmap at <path> — every milestone lists with no arc name.` The campaigns read
takes the absent file as the empty document, so its line says `campaigns: none active.` The
zero-arc-rows refusal above is reached only by a roadmap that *exists*, so the
grammar-drift guard keeps its teeth. This is the degrade disposition the rest of the corpus already
declares for `ROADMAP.md`; `homes` was the one reader treating it fail-loud.

**Absent and unreadable are separated by a filesystem probe, never by the text of a read failure.**
The verb asks `exists(<path>)` first: a probe that could not be *performed* refuses `11`, `false`
takes the absent path above, and only on `true` does it read — a read that then fails is the `11`
row. The `ReadFailed` this package raises flattens `NotFound` and `EACCES` into one `reason` string,
so matching on that string would be a guess dressed as a discrimination.

**Scope** — every open milestone in `--repo`, paginated, joined to the `## Arcs` and `## Campaigns`
tables of the roadmap file, read from the repo root the delivery layer already sets as the process
cwd (see the CLI convention's Delivery section) unless `--roadmap` overrides it. **Zero open
milestones is a refusal, not an answer**: an empty candidate list routes the skill toward a standing
lane or a kill, and a kill driven by a failed read is irreversible.

**On a `7` refusal stdout is empty and `--json` emits nothing** — the offered lanes go to stderr with
the refusal message, which is why the label read runs ahead of the milestone read. An earlier draft printed the lanes on stdout while withholding the outcome
token; that is a partial answer at a non-zero exit, which the shared conventions forbid and which
hands a byte-reading caller two rows and no token.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika triage homes
homes
milestone	47	Search and discovery
milestone	52	Merge-Gate Reliability	running: p0/p1 or blocker
lane	wayfinder:backlog	a standing lane this repo declares
lane	axis:pipeline-hardening	a standing lane this repo declares
```

```
$ fabrika triage homes --json
{"outcome":"homes","milestones":[{"number":47,"title":"Search and discovery","roadmapRow":"Gateway"},{"number":52,"title":"Merge-Gate Reliability","roadmapRow":null,"running":"running: p0/p1 or blocker"}],"lanes":[{"label":"wayfinder:backlog","meaning":"a standing lane this repo declares"},{"label":"axis:pipeline-hardening","meaning":"a standing lane this repo declares"}],"scanned":2}
```

**Grounding**

- v1 `list-open-milestones.sh:11` issues `gh api "repos/$REPO/milestones?state=open"` with no
  `per_page` and no `--paginate`, capping candidates at GitHub's default 30 with no truncation
  signal — while "nothing fits" routes to an irreversible kill.
- v1 made the agent join milestones to the roadmap by hand from two sources, one of them silently
  truncated. The join is mechanical, so it belongs here.
- v1's `homing-guard` treats "homed" as `milestone !== null` and never checks the milestone is open or
  on-roadmap, so a closed milestone reports as a valid home. Offering only open, roadmap-joined
  milestones designs that mismatch out at the point of assignment rather than detecting it later.
- Curating the milestone set is a human roadmap act, so no verb here creates one.
- A closing campaign kept taking every lane's follow-ups because nothing in this verb's output said
  which milestone was running, so triagers homed by title match. The marker is only a
  subtraction; enforcement is deliberately absent, since both exceptions are judgements a verb cannot
  check and a guard blind to them would refuse exactly the work the rule allows.

## `triage split`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika triage split 7 --title "Editor loses focus after save" [--token <claim-token>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

The child body arrives on **stdin only**. There is no `--body` and no `--body-file`: a flag that
takes a path turns the body into a string the verb could post verbatim, which is how a machine-local
path reaches a public issue while the poster reads success. A shell redirect is expected — the
*shell* reads the file, so what reaches the verb is already bytes.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the parent issue this unit is split from |
| `--title` | string | yes | — | the child's single-unit title; also half the create-once key |
| `--token` | string | no | none | the claim token `triage claim` handed this lane; without it the guard reads the session alone and refuses once two lanes of it hold live markers |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

**Output** — machine channel. One tab-separated line: `<outcome>`, `<number>`, `<url>`, where
`<outcome>` is `created` or `reused`. With `--json`, an object with keys `outcome`, `number`, `url`,
`matchedOn` (`"back-reference+title"` on `reused`, `null` on `created`), and `crossLinked` (boolean).

**`crossLinked` is `false` on every `reused`**, and that is a fact rather than a failure: a reuse
prints and stops before step 4, so no cross-link is attempted. The parent was cross-linked when the
child was first created. A caller must not read `"crossLinked":false` on a `reused` as a broken link.

**What the operation does, in order.** (1) Assert `status:needs-triage` exists in `--repo` (see
Scope). (2) Read the scope below. (3) On a match, print `reused` and stop — **the existing child's
body is not updated from stdin**, because a reuse is an idempotency answer, not an edit, and silently
rewriting a child someone may have already triaged would lose their work. (4) On no match, compose
and create the child. (5) Post a `split into #<child>` comment on the parent.

**Step 5 is best-effort and never changes the exit status.** A failed cross-link is reported on
stderr; the child exists either way, and mapping it to `8` would be a lie, since `8` means the create
outcome is unknown and here the create demonstrably landed. The durable trace is the child's own
back-reference, which is the key this verb reads on a re-run; the parent comment is for human readers.

**Both outcomes are answers and both exit 0**, and both print the same shape — a caller reads the
token, never a sentence. v1 printed two different English sentences from two different tools and made
every caller regex a number back out of prose.

### The child this verb creates

An earlier revision never said. Two things broke silently as a result, and both are why the shape is
pinned here rather than left to an implementer.

**The child carries `status:needs-triage`.** Without it the child is invisible to read 1 below — this
verb's own primary create-once read — so the read could never match anything this verb produced, and
every re-run would fire a fresh twin. The label is what makes read 1 load-bearing rather than dead
code against its own output. It is also simply correct: a freshly split child has not been triaged.

**The child carries the agent footer.** Without it `triage provenance` answers `human` and
`triage kill` refuses the child **forever** on `12` — a split child could never be killed, not even
as a duplicate of its own sibling. The footer comes from `renderFooter` in
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/compose.ts`; **import it, do not re-derive it**, and its field rules
(the literal first, the timestamp last, `session`/`model`/`branch` droppable with their separators)
apply unchanged.

The composed body, where `<STDIN>` is the caller's bytes:

```
<STDIN>

split from #<parent>

---
<sub>Filed by an agent · session `<id>` · model `<name>` · branch `<ref>` · <timestamp></sub>
```

The leak scan runs over this composed body **after** composition, so nothing the verb itself appends
can escape it — the same ordering `report file` uses.

**The create-once key.** The verb writes `split from #<parent>` into the child body itself, so the key
it later matches on is one it wrote rather than one a caller remembered — v1 called the
back-reference load-bearing and then never checked the body carried it, so a child filed without it
was permanently invisible to the guard and every re-run fired a fresh twin. Matching is on `(parent
back-reference AND normalized title)`. Title normalization is **Unicode-aware** (`\p{L}\p{N}`), not
ASCII: v1's ASCII key shreds a Turkish title into a handful of fragments, so two genuinely different
Turkish-titled siblings of one parent can collapse to the same key and the second is falsely reused —
a silent lost split, in the one direction v1's own module says it refuses.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing |
| `5` | the composed child body carries a machine-local path |
| `6` | the child body is a bare `@` path reference — the body never arrived |
| `7` | the parent is proven absent (404), is closed, or `status:needs-triage` does not exist in the repository |
| `8` | the create failed — UNKNOWN whether a child landed |
| `9` | the child was created but the read-back does not match |
| `11` | a precondition read failed — the parent, its comments, the claim on it, the queue, the timeline, or a candidate's body |
| `17` | a live claim marker on the parent names another session — or, when `--token` named this lane, another lane of this one; a tokenless call is refused once two lanes of its session hold live markers |

| `triage split: could not cross-link parent #<p> to child #<c>: <reason> — the child exists; add the comment by hand.` | 0 | notice |

**Scope** — a zero-scope precondition, then two REST reads, neither of them the search index.

**The precondition.** Before read 1, the verb asserts `status:needs-triage` exists in `--repo`'s label
set. Read 1's label is a hardcoded literal while `--repo` is generic, so a renamed label or a
scope-limited token returns HTTP 200 with `[]` — **not** a read failure, and therefore not `11`. The
verb would fall straight through to `created` and mint a twin. Without this check the one verb built
to be fail-closed answers over zero scope — the fail-open it exists to prevent. Absent label ⇒ `7`,
with the same shape of message `triage queue` uses.

**Read 1 — the intake queue. This is the primary, and the create-once guarantee rests on it.**
`GET /repos/{repo}/issues?state=open&labels=status:needs-triage&per_page=100`, paginated. Two
properties make it the load-bearing half: it is the **read-after-write consistent** source, and the
children this verb creates carry that label by construction.

**"Read-after-write consistent" is the repo's stated premise, not a verified platform fact.** It is
asserted in roughly a dozen places (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/report/dedup-verb.ts`,
`packages/pipeline-cli/src/tools/split-guard/github.ts`, and on down) and grounded in none of them —
no doc link, no measurement. It is recorded here as the premise this design rests on so that if it is
ever falsified, the thing to re-derive is obvious.

**Read 1 returns titles, never bodies**, so the match runs in two stages. The list read projects at
transport — `packages/fabrika-cli/src/io/issues.ts` issues a `--jq` of
`"\(.number)\t\(.title)"`, so bodies never leave `gh` — which means:

1. **Narrow by normalized title first.** Keep only rows whose normalized title equals the normalized
   `--title`. Usually zero or one survive.
2. **Then fetch each survivor's body** with the per-issue `getIssue` in the same module and test it
   for `split from #<parent>`. `getIssue` returns a three-way `Existence`: `Present`, `Absent`, or
   `Unknown`. **An `Unknown` on any survivor is `11`** — that survivor might be the child, and
   creating over an unread candidate is exactly the twin this verb exists to prevent.

An N+1 fetch is the cost of a list read that carries no bodies. Narrowing first is what keeps N at
roughly one.

**Read 2 — the parent's timeline. Supplementary, and explicitly not the guarantee.**
`GET /repos/{repo}/issues/{parent}/timeline`, event type `cross-referenced`, with the child number at
`source.issue.number`. It reaches children that have already been triaged out of the queue, which
read 1 cannot see, and that is the only reason it is here. Three constraints, all of them the repo's
own findings about this endpoint:

- **It lags.** `packages/pipeline-cli/src/tools/merge-queue-classify/` records ~30–60 minutes of
  observed staleness on this endpoint and states that "an ejection that has not yet surfaced in the
  timeline reads identically" to one that never happened. A read that can be that far behind
  cannot carry a create-once guarantee for a child made seconds ago.
- **It pages at 30 by default**, so `--paginate` is mandatory and the `--jq` streams rather than
  buffering the whole timeline.
- **A failed read is `11`**, never a silent `created`.

So: **the create-once guarantee rests on read 1.** Read 2 widens the net for older children and
narrows nothing. An earlier revision described both halves as "read-after-write consistent", which
was wrong about this one and would have let an implementer trust the lagging source.

**Neither half may be the search index.** The index is eventually consistent, so a child created
seconds ago is invisible to it — which is precisely the five-second twin window this verb exists to
close. `report dedup` may use the index because it is advisory; a create-once guard may not.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika triage split 7 --title "Editor loses focus after save" < child.md
created	9	https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/9
```

```
$ fabrika triage split 7 --title "Editor loses focus after save" < child.md
reused	9	https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/9
$ echo $?
0
```

```
$ fabrika triage split 7 --title "Editor loses focus after save" --json < child.md
{"outcome":"created","number":9,"url":"https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/9","matchedOn":null,"crossLinked":true}
```

**Grounding**

- Two byte-identical children five seconds apart; the create-once guard is that incident.
- v1 `split-child.sh:22-26` captures `split-guard`'s stdout and **never inspects its exit status**.
  The guard prints nothing on its negative, so an auth failure, a rate limit or a decode error
  produces the identical empty string as a proven "safe to create" — and the script falls through to
  the POST. That is why every outcome here is a token.
- v1 `split-match.ts:40-45` normalizes titles with `title.toLowerCase().split(/[^a-z0-9]+/)` —
  ASCII-only, against a corpus whose product titles carry non-ASCII letters. This is the same defect
  `intake-dedup` was fixed for and `split-guard` never received.
- v1 never cross-linked the parent; the `split into #A, #B` comment was left to the model. This verb
  posts it as part of the same operation, so the provenance trace is not optional.
- The timeline endpoint's observed staleness and its 30-per-page default are the reason it is the
  supplementary half here rather than the guarantee.

## `triage enrich`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika triage enrich 7 [--epic] [--token <claim-token>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

The rewrite — or, with `--epic`, the pitch — arrives on **stdin only**, for the reason given under
`triage split`.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the issue to enrich |
| `--epic` | boolean | no | `false` | wrap the original in place under a fixed header and head the pitch above it, instead of writing a rewrite over it; stdin carries the pitch, not a rewrite |
| `--token` | string | no | none | the claim token `triage claim` handed this lane; without it the guard reads the session alone and refuses once two lanes of it hold live markers |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |
| stdin | markdown | yes | — | one `## In plain words` section (below), plus the rewritten body that goes above the preserved original — with `--epic`, the pitch's five field lines instead: `**Problem:**`, `**Arc:**`, `**Appetite:** <S\|M\|L>`, `**Rabbit-holes:**`, `**No-gos:**`, one per line, plus the optional `**Success:**` line |

**Output** — machine channel. One tab-separated line: `enriched`, `<number>`, `<redactions>`, where
`<redactions>` is the count of machine-local paths masked in the preserved original. With `--json`,
an object with keys `outcome`, `number`, `redactions`, and `mode` (`rewrite` or `wrap`).

**The envelope, byte for byte.** The verb composes the new body itself, so the bytes are pinned here
rather than left to an implementer who would then verify them against a read-back of their own
invention. Default mode, where `<SUMMARY>` is the paragraph under stdin's `## In plain words`
heading, `<REWRITE>` is the rest of stdin verbatim, and `<ORIGINAL>` is the redacted original:

```
## In plain words

<SUMMARY>

<REWRITE>

---

<!-- fabrika:enriched issue=<N> mode=rewrite -->
<details>
<summary>Original report (verbatim)</summary>

<ORIGINAL>

</details>
```

`--epic` mode emits the **pitch** instead of a rewrite, above a fixed header and the wrapped
original, where `<PITCH>` is the rest of stdin verbatim:

```
## In plain words

<SUMMARY>

## Pitch

<PITCH>

## Epic — awaiting plan

`plan-epic` appends its plan and dependency topology below.

<!-- fabrika:enriched issue=<N> mode=wrap -->
<details>
<summary>Original brief (verbatim)</summary>

<ORIGINAL>

</details>
```

**The plain-language summary leads every body, in both modes.** It is what a person deciding many
rows reads first, and what agenda prep reads when it writes a row's "In plain words" line. The
caller sends it as one
`## In plain words` section anywhere on stdin; the verb lifts it out and writes it first, so its
position is the verb's, never the author's. The section is the heading and **the one paragraph under
it** — it ends at the first blank line after that paragraph, or at the next heading — because the
pitch's field lines carry no heading that could end it. Write 2-3 everyday sentences: what is wrong,
who it hurts, what we would do. It stays honest, not salesy, and says what the body below it says.
A heading inside a fenced block is quoted content, not the section. Stdin with no such section, an
empty one, or more than one is refused on `26`; a section with nothing else on stdin is `3`. The
grammar is `packages/fabrika-cli/src/triage/plain-summary.ts`.

**The `<!-- fabrika:enriched … -->` line is the re-enrich marker**, described in full under the
detector below. It renders as nothing, it is the boundary between the region this verb owns and the
bytes it must never touch, and it carries the issue number it was written on.

An epic's original is consumed verbatim by the downstream planning step, so a **rewrite** above it
would fork the brief — which is why this mode never takes one. **A pitch is not a rewrite**: it is
the five-field bet `pitch-guard` requires in the body of every `status:triaged` `type:epic`
(`packages/pipeline-cli/src/tools/pitch-guard/pitch-guard.ts:219-223` — an epic is lane-entering
unconditionally, with no parent test — and `:244-246`, where an absent `## Pitch` section is the
red), and this is the only verb in the group that writes a body. An earlier revision read no stdin
here at all, which left an epic **structurally unable to carry the section a CI guard fires on** at
the very label `triage apply` writes.

**Nothing this mode adds can reach the brief.** A planner splices around the envelope: it anchors on
the exact headings `## Dependencies` and `## Plan (plan-epic)` and preserves every other byte
verbatim, so neither heading above is an anchor it can cut on, and the wrapped original is untouched
bytes either way. That is an agreement rather than a coincidence — the envelope is a wire format
fabrika owns, and a splicer conforms to it by pinning fabrika's golden fixture in a test of its own,
so a reworded anchor set reds a test on the side that reworded. What `plan-epic` *does* change is
where the wrap sits: `## Plan (plan-epic)` and `## Dependencies` both land **below** it, so this
mode's envelope stops being terminal the moment the epic is planned. The re-enrich detector below
tests position nowhere, in either mode, for exactly that reason; a re-enrich replaces the pitch and
the header from fresh stdin and preserves the wrap — and everything under it — unchanged, exactly as
the default mode replaces a rewrite.

**Stdin carries the `## In plain words` section and the five field lines, not the `## Pitch`
heading.** The summary section is the one heading `--epic` stdin does send. The verb writes
`## Pitch` itself, so the heading always matches the guard's anchor rather than a caller's typing; a caller who sends
the heading too gets two of them, and the guard reads the empty section between them as a pitch
missing all five fields — loud at the seam, never a silent pass. The five lines and the optional
sixth, stated here rather than deferred to another skill's prose:

```
**Problem:** <who has it, and what breaks or stalls for them today>
**Arc:** <the home just assigned — the milestone title, or the standing lane>
**Appetite:** <S|M|L>
**Rabbit-holes:** <the named traps — the specific ways this overspends if left unbounded>
**No-gos:** <what this deliberately does not do>
**Success:** <the one sentence the two-week check judges the shipped bet against>
```

**The label opens the line.** The guard reads a field as `<optional emphasis><name><optional
emphasis>:` anchored at line start over optional spaces and tabs, tolerating case and `Rabbit holes`
for `Rabbit-holes` (`packages/fabrika-cli/src/guard/pitch.ts` `readField`) — so a bulleted
`- Problem: …` does **not** read as a field. Field order is not load-bearing. `Appetite` is a size,
upper-case `S`, `M` or `L`, whose dollar amount per epic child is the repo's `appetiteSizes` key in
`.fabrika.jsonc` (shipped S = $15, M = $35, L = $40); a legacy whole positive number of cycles still
parses, so an older pitch stays well-formed (`parseAppetite`). `Success` is optional: a pitch without
it is still well-formed, and a drafter writes it whenever the bet has a result anyone could check.

**`## Epic — awaiting plan` is a heading, and that is load-bearing rather than cosmetic.** The guard
reads the pitch section from `## Pitch` to *the next heading of any level, or end of body*
(`pitch-guard.ts:73-80`), so a plain bold line there would run the section on **into the wrapped
original** — and a field the draft omitted could then be satisfied by any `**Problem:**`-shaped line
the reporter happened to type. Section scoping is the guard's own defence against exactly that read
(its comment: *"Scoping field extraction to this section is what keeps a plan-epic body's
`### Problem & who has it` from reading as a pitch field"*), and this heading is what keeps that
defence true here.

**That is measured, not reasoned.** `readPitch` was run on 2026-08-03 over both envelopes, with a
draft deliberately missing `Problem` and a brief containing a `**Problem:**` line. With this
heading: `malformed ["Problem"]` — caught. With a bold line in its place: `present`, appetite 2 — a
pitch the drafter never wrote, passing on the reporter's prose. A caller who sends the `## Pitch`
heading too reads `malformed` on all five, and the canonical envelope reads `present` and resolves
`pitched` against a `pitch-approved: appetite 2 cycles` comment. **Do not demote this heading back
to bold text.**

**The pitch is drafted here and judged nowhere here.** Well-formedness and founder approval are
`pitch-guard`'s, at the `status:triaged` seam `triage apply` trips; this spec computes no second
verdict on a gated question, which is the same reason a `triage pitch-check` verb is not derived.
This verb refuses only what it can refuse about text the caller just wrote — empty (`3`), a
machine-local path (`5`), a bare `@` reference (`6`), an acceptance-criteria block the wire
reader rejects (`15`, below), a missing one over a target already stamped `ready-for:agent`
(`16`, below), and a missing plain-language summary (`26`) — and `--epic` **adds no exit code of its own**: reaching those same
refusals is the removal of a restriction, not a new outcome, and `16` is one it does not reach at
all.

**The re-enrich detector is the marker this verb writes — one rule, mode-independent**, settled by a
founder ruling. A body counts as already-enriched **when, and only when, it carries a marker line
bound to this issue**:

```
<!-- fabrika:enriched issue=<N> mode=<rewrite|wrap> -->
```

matched **anchored to a whole line**, never as a substring — a filing that *mentions* the marker in
prose is an ordinary filing here, and reading its prose as a marker would overwrite the reporter's
own text above the mention.

**This supersedes the two shape-based detectors this section specified before the ruling** — default
mode's terminality-plus-`Original report (verbatim)` test, and `--epic`'s three envelope anchors.
The reasoning that produced them is not withdrawn: each was correct about its own mode, and the
`--epic` rule's position-independence was itself the ruled fix to a real compounding bug — once
`plan-epic` runs, `## Plan (plan-epic)` and `## Dependencies` sit *below* the wrap (`plan-epic` Step
2 writes the plan "below the untouched brief", and a first-time plan with no topology yet appends at
end of body), so a terminality test stops matching on every planned epic. What the ruling settles is
that **both** were mode-scoped and keyed on disjoint literals, so neither could recognise the other
mode's envelope. A re-run in the other mode therefore fell through to "first enrichment ⇒ wrap" and
nested the whole existing envelope — pitch, header, plan, topology and the previous provenance
boundary — inside a fresh block, compounding per run and labelling authored content as the
reporter's own text. That path is ordinary rather than exotic: `triage apply`'s owned-facet table
owns `^type:`, so re-classifying an enriched issue to `type:epic` and re-enriching with `--epic` is
a supported sequence with no guard between its steps.

A marker is written by this verb and by nothing else, so presence *is* the answer, whichever mode
wrote it and whichever mode is re-running. The class dies for every marker-bearing body rather than
for one axis of it.

**The marker is also the boundary.** It sits on its own line immediately above the opening
`<details>`, so "is this enriched?" and "where does the authored region end?" are the same read.
Nothing has to locate a `<details>` opener or a summary literal — which is precisely what made the
retired detectors mode-scoped. **On a match the verb replaces the authored region only — byte 0 up to
the marker — and preserves the marker's line onward, the block *and every byte below it*, verbatim**
(it re-emits a fresh marker carrying the mode that just wrote the region). Preserving the block alone
would be the same destruction by a shorter route: it would delete the plan and the dependency
topology `plan-epic` wrote underneath. Default mode's match is the same rule where "everything below"
is empty.

**The split is on the FIRST marker in the body.** The verb always writes its own marker *above* the
preserved region, so a marker carried *inside* preserved content — a quoted envelope, a foreign paste
that was wrapped — is always the later one and can never be mistaken for the boundary.

**Legacy is a self-healing migration, and is meant to be deleted.** On meeting a **pre-marker**
wrapped body the verb recognises the two v1 envelope shapes below — default mode's terminality test,
and `--epic`'s three anchors — **does not double-wrap**, and **stamps the marker in passing**. Every
body that branch can match therefore converts on its next enrichment and never returns to it. It is
one-time code that retires with v1-backlog absorption, by founder mandate; an implementation
keeps it separable so retiring it is a delete rather than an excavation. The shapes are used **only**
for a body carrying no marker at all — a body whose marker binds *another* issue short-circuits ahead
of them, so the legacy door cannot re-admit the impersonation the binding exists to refuse.

### The two v1 envelope shapes — legacy recognisers only, never the detector

Restated here **only** as what the legacy branch recognises, so the clause above resolves against a
specification rather than a label, and so the retirement has something to delete. These are **not**
the detector: detection is marker presence, and it is mode-independent. They decide nothing about a
marker-bearing body — a body whose marker binds *another* issue short-circuits ahead of them
(`detect`, `enrich.ts:95-107`) — and they are consulted **only** for a body carrying no marker at
all. Their whole purpose is that a **pre-marker** body is preserved rather than double-wrapped. Both
live in exactly one place, `packages/fabrika-cli/src/triage/enrich-legacy.ts`, whose retirement is a
whole-file delete plus the injected `legacyPreserved` argument at `detect`'s call sites.

**v1 default mode — terminality plus the report literal.** All three conditions hold: the body
carries a line that is exactly `<summary>Original report (verbatim)</summary>`; that line's
`<details>` opener sits immediately above it, blank lines aside; and the body's **last non-blank
line** is `</details>`, so the block closes at end of body. The preserved region is that opener line
onward, to end of body.

**v1 `--epic` mode — three anchors, position-independent** (the ruled option). All three
conditions hold: the body's **first** line is exactly `## Pitch`; the body carries the exact line
`## Epic — awaiting plan`; and the first `<summary>Original brief (verbatim)</summary>` line sits
**below** that header. The preserved region is that summary's `<details>` opener line onward, to end
of body.

Every line test above compares the line with trailing whitespace stripped, and each anchor resolves
to its **first** occurrence in the body.

**The quote-protection is preserved, and it moved onto the binding.** The strict form is required for
the same reason `triage provenance` pins its footer match, but the failure direction is worse:
provenance fails *open* toward a wrong verdict, while a loose re-enrich detector fails
*destructively* — "replace everything above the boundary" applied to an issue that merely **quotes**
an enrichment envelope (a bug report about this very format, a pasted body) silently deletes every
line above the paste, on a public issue, irreversibly. In this repo an issue pasting a fabrika
envelope is an ordinary filing, not an exotic one.

**The issue number bound into the marker is what holds that line, and it holds a strictly wider one
than the anchors did.** A pasted envelope carries the marker of the issue it was written on, so on
*any other* issue it reads as **fresh** and is wrapped rather than partially overwritten — whatever
the paste's shape, and wherever in the body it sits. That covers both the quote-impersonation case
the retired anchors defended against **and** the residual the section previously had to state as
uncovered: a body whose *first* bytes are a raw paste of a complete envelope. That case was
byte-indistinguishable from an enriched body under any content-derived test, and terminality did not
cover it either (a paste that ends the body is terminal). The section named the answer at the time —
*"if it ever bites the answer is a marker the verb writes and a paste does not, never a weaker
anchor"* — and this is that answer.

The `--epic` anchors, which the legacy branch still uses as recognisers, survive a plan because a
splicer cuts only on `## Dependencies` and `## Plan (plan-epic)`: `## Pitch` and
`## Epic — awaiting plan` are bytes it never touches, and so is the marker, which is neither of those
two headings. That is the splicer's obligation to this format rather than a fact fabrika inherits —
which side owes which is settled by the rule that fabrika owns a shared format and the other side
pins its fixture.

**That survival is pinned executably, not only argued.** A splicer's unit tests run a real envelope
through a first-time plan and a re-plan and assert that the `<details>` block stops being terminal,
that the anchors still hold, that the wrapped original survives byte-for-byte, and that the summary
line never doubles. Under that rule the envelope those tests run is fabrika's committed golden
fixture, so a rewording here reds them; the block presently lives in
`packages/pipeline-cli/src/tools/epic-splice/epic-splice.unit.test.ts` with a hand-copied envelope
and is scheduled to split — fixture and detector to fabrika, preservation assertions to the splicer.
The marker rule is pinned on the verb's own side, in
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/triage/enrich.unit.test.ts`, which
reproduces the **retired** detectors in-test as controls: the cross-mode re-run they miss is asserted
to be recognised here, a pasted envelope bound to another issue is asserted to read as fresh, and a
legacy body is asserted to be recognised, preserved and stamped. Change the rule and those tests go
red, which is what keeps this section from drifting back into an assumption.

**Idempotency, stated as the other write verbs state theirs — and now unconditional.** Re-running
`enrich` on an already-enriched issue **converges**: it replaces the authored region from fresh
stdin and leaves the marker's line onward — the preserved original and every byte below it —
unchanged, so a second pass produces the same body as the first, nesting never accumulates, and "the
innermost original" is not a case that arises. This holds over a **planned** epic body (the position
axis) and it holds when the re-run's mode **differs** from the mode that wrote the envelope (the
mode axis) — the two qualifications the sentence previously needed. The one case it does not claim
is a body carrying no marker and matching neither v1 shape, which is a *first* enrichment by
definition rather than a re-run. The detector itself refuses nothing — it is a body-composition
rule, not a refusal branch, so it adds no row to the exit-status or error tables below. This is the
rule's only statement in this spec; the Scope section below states the scope and does not restate
it.

**Redaction is asymmetric and deliberate.** The **preserved original** is foreign content: any
machine-local path in it is masked to its class root, counted, and reported on stderr with its line
number. **Your rewrite** is authored now, so a machine-local path in it is refused on exit `5` — you
can fix what you just wrote. Refusing the original instead would strand the enrichment on somebody
else's leak, and preserving it unredacted re-commits that leak into a public issue.

**The acceptance-criteria block is read back before the write, and the split follows redaction's.**
A producer runs its consumer's reader, so this verb runs the criteria format's own registered reader
([`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/acceptance-criteria.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/acceptance-criteria.ts))
over the body it has composed and refuses on `15` when the answer is `Malformed`, so a block every
downstream grader would reject never reaches the board. **The grammar is not restated here or in
`SKILL.md`** — the module owns it and the refusal quotes the reader's own reason. Two boundaries
carry the weight:

- **The read runs over the composed body, not over stdin.** The authored region includes what the
  envelope adds, so a heading the template itself demoted is caught. Reading stdin alone would miss
  exactly the case the producer-runs-its-consumer's-reader rule names: the defect the consumer would
  reject is one the producer's own composition introduced, so only the composed bytes carry it.
- **It stops above the marker**, on the same asymmetry redaction uses: the preserved original is
  foreign content, and a legacy `##` heading buried in it would otherwise refuse every
  re-enrichment of that issue forever.

`Absent` is **not** a refusal on its own. An epic pitch, a decision, a parked ticket may legitimately
carry no criteria block; a verb that demanded one would be a different verb.

**Over a target already carrying `ready-for:agent`, `Absent` is a broken promise and `16` is the
refusal.** That label says a builder can pick the issue up cold, and the criteria block is what the
promise is made of — so a rewrite composing none over a stamped issue leaves the label standing on no
contract, and nothing re-reads it until `build claim` refuses a lane that has already been spawned.
One issue shipped exactly that and cost a claim and a back-off. The check runs on the same authored
region the reader above scans, against the **live** labels the verb already fetched, and writes
nothing. The two escapes are on the refusal line: author the block into the rewrite and re-send, or
drop the audience label first with `fabrika triage apply <n> --ready-for human`. **`--epic` is
exempt**, for the reason `triage apply` exempts `--type epic`: an epic's criteria arrive per child
from the plan ledger, so demanding a block on an epic body would make every epic un-enrichable. An
issue carrying no `ready-for:agent` label is untouched by this — a criteria-less rewrite there is
still accepted, exactly as it was.

### The outside-diff evidence marker

**A criterion whose proof cannot live in the diff says so, and it says so at mint time.** The marker
is a trailing `[evidence: <source>]` on the criterion's own line, and `<source>` names where the
proof lives:

```markdown
### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] the stored-id migration runs on load
- [ ] a desk checkpointed under the old shape comes back whole [evidence: hand-verification on a real desk]
```

Six facts about the grammar, all of them the wire module's
([`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/acceptance-criteria.ts`](../../../../packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/acceptance-criteria.ts)),
so the refusal quotes its reason rather than this page's:

- The marker is the **last** thing on the criterion, after the sentence and after any wrap. A
  trailing HTML comment is machinery beside the row and sits below the marker, not above it.
- The keyword is `evidence`, lower case. A case drift (`[Evidence: …]`) is `Malformed` on `15`,
  never silently left as prose — the same rule that makes a drifted heading a defect rather than a
  fact.
- A marker naming no source (`[evidence:]`) is `Malformed` on `15`. A marker that points at nothing
  is the whole defect the field exists to catch.
- A bracketed tail under any other keyword — `[see the design manifest]` — is ordinary criterion
  text and is left alone.
- The source is free prose, and a reviewer has to be able to **find** what it names: a section
  heading in the PR body, an artifact, a comment URL. "it was tested" names nothing.
- `emit` round-trips it, so a block read and rewritten keeps every marker it arrived with.

**Mark it only when the diff genuinely cannot settle it** — a property of an artifact written
*before* the fix, a rendered surface verified by hand, a runtime observation. A criterion a test
could discharge is not a marked criterion; marking it moves a mechanical check onto a reviewer's
word, which is the opposite of what this marker buys.

**Why the choice sits here rather than in the gate.** The author knows the proof is a
hand-verification; a grader reading the sentence months later cannot infer it, and before the marker
existed it inferred the only thing it could — that an undischarged criterion is a `FAIL`. One
adjudicated-clean PR drew three of those in a row on a single criterion of this shape, at
temperature 0.0 over byte-identical input. `review` grades a marked criterion on the evidence it
names and refuses a `PASS` naming none (`review post`'s `19`), so the marker is what makes that
grading rule reachable at all.

The verb counts the marked rows on stderr and quotes each one, so the write is visible to whoever
ran it:

```text
triage enrich: 1 of 2 criteria in the rewrite mark evidence outside the diff — review grades each on
the evidence it names, never on the diff alone:
  - "a desk checkpointed under the old shape comes back whole" — evidence: hand-verification on a real desk
```

### A stated ordering must be an edge, and `20` is the refusal

The native `blocked_by` graph is the one carrier of "do not start this yet", so an ordering that
lives only in prose produces an issue `build pick` admits and no lane can build: one issue said
verbatim "**Blocked. Do not start until #N has merged**" over a graph with zero edges, and a build
lane spent a claim, a read pass and a back-off on it. A founder ruling makes this verb fail-closed
over it, on the same idiom as `fanout-guard` and `catalog-guard`.

**What counts as a stated ordering.** The scan runs over the **authored region only** — the same
contract region the criteria reader scans, so the preserved original inside `<details>` and any
fenced block are out of reach — and a line states an ordering when an **ordering phrase binds an
issue reference**: `blocked by/on/until/behind #N`, `do not start until/before #N`,
`depends on #N`, `dependent on #N`, or `order is … #N`. A keyword merely co-present with a `#N` is
not one, and neither is an ordering inside an inline-code span, a double-quoted span, or a
blockquote — those are somebody else's words being reported. The bar is deliberately this narrow:
a red on a body that owns no prerequisite could not be cleared by wiring an edge, so it would leave
only the reword escape on a body that is already correct.

**The phrase must be in the issue's own voice.** A body states its own prerequisite as "Blocked on
#N"; a bare third-person subject — "it is already blocked on #N", "they depend on #N" — is a report
about something the body just mentioned, and no edge on *this* issue could clear it. One body said
verbatim "Not folded into #A: its criteria are scoped to … and it is already blocked on #B" and owns
no prerequisite at all. `This work is blocked until #N` is not covered: a named subject reads as
self-reference.

**A `#N` that is a pull request is not a prerequisite here.** The graph names a blocking PR by the
issue its merge closes, and `--blocked-by` refuses a PR on `21`, so reding on one would leave the
reword escape alone on a body that is often already right — over the 150 most recently created
issues, 5 of the 6 bodies this gate refused named a PR. The verb reads each number the ordering names
and drops the pull requests, printing which ones it dropped and why.

**The refusal reads the issue's own live `blocked_by` set** and reds when a number a stated ordering
names is absent from it, writing nothing. A read that failed is `11`, never a pass — and so is a
number whose issue-versus-PR question could not be settled.

**There is no override flag, and that is deliberate.** The refusal names the two escapes the ruling
allows — **wire the edge** with `fabrika triage apply <n> --blocked-by <m>` and re-send, or
**reword** the body so it states no ordering it does not own. A false red costs one of those two
moves; a bypass costs a builder a claim on unstartable work.

**Scope** — one issue body, plus the caller's stdin: the rewrite, or the pitch with `--epic`. An
issue proven absent is `7`; a body that could not be read is `11`; a body that *was* read and is
empty is `7`, a read that succeeded over nothing. None of the three ever degrades to an empty
original preserved as though it were the record — which is the failure that would quietly delete a
report while printing `enriched`. Re-enrichment is covered above, under the detector.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika triage enrich 7 < enriched.md
enriched	7	0
```

```
$ fabrika triage enrich 8 < enriched.md
triage enrich: redacted 1 machine-local path(s) from the preserved original (lines 12).
enriched	8	1
```

```
$ fabrika triage enrich 6 --epic < pitch.md
enriched	6	0
```

```
$ fabrika triage enrich 7 --json < enriched.md
{"outcome":"enriched","number":7,"redactions":0,"mode":"rewrite"}
```

```
$ fabrika triage enrich 5 < enriched.md
triage enrich: the rewrite states an ordering on #4 that #5's live blocked_by graph carries no
edge for (line 7: "**Blocked. Do not start until #4 has merged** — it adds the invalidate arm.").
The graph is the one carrier, so a builder reads the edges and never this sentence. There is no
override: either wire the edge — `fabrika triage apply 5 --blocked-by 4` — and re-send, or reword
the body so it states no ordering it does not own. Nothing was written.
$ echo $?
20
```

```
$ fabrika triage enrich 9 < enriched.md
triage enrich: #9 carries ready-for:agent and the rewrite composes no acceptance-criteria block the
wire reader answers Found on — no heading in the body reaches for "### Acceptance criteria". That
label promises a builder can pick the issue up cold, and the block is what the promise is made of.
Either author a "### Acceptance criteria" block into the rewrite and re-send, or drop the audience
label first with `fabrika triage apply 9 --ready-for human`. Nothing was written.
$ echo $?
16
```

```
$ fabrika triage enrich 7 < no-summary.md
triage enrich: the rewrite carries no "## In plain words" section — every enriched issue opens with
one. Add the section with one paragraph of 2-3 everyday sentences (what is wrong, who it hurts, what
we would do) that matches the body, and re-send. Nothing was written.
$ echo $?
26
```

**Grounding**

- A verbatim re-emit once re-committed a machine-local path into a public issue. Fidelity loses to
  the leak invariant, and the redaction preserves evidential shape rather than stripping.
- v1 split this across `fetch-original.sh` and `patch-body.sh` and left **both** `original.md` and
  `original.redacted.md` on disk, with a code comment as the only thing steering the caller to the
  safe one. A leak invariant enforced by a filename preference is not enforced. Here one operation
  owns fetch, redact and write, and the raw original never exists as a separate artifact.
- v1 `patch-body.sh:24` reads the body through `BODY="$(cat …)"`, which strips every trailing
  newline, then passes it in argv — against a step that promises byte-for-byte preservation and can
  hit `ARG_MAX` on a large enrichment. Stdin and an in-process envelope remove both.
- v1's `PATCH` had no read-back, while the skill's own Step 0 names last-write-wins body clobbering
  as the reason its claim exists.
- The founder ruling behind the detector — it is a verb-written marker rather than envelope-shape
  inspection, with the issue number bound into it and a self-healing legacy migration. It supersedes
  the two shape-based detectors this section carried, on evidence from a prior investigation. A
  wrap-last unification stays on the table as within-brief design for fabrika's `plan-epic`; if it
  is adopted later the marker becomes redundant insurance, and nothing here has to be undone.
- The §PITCH ruling — lane-entering work becomes pickable only carrying a pitch, and `pitch-guard`
  scopes **every** triaged `type:epic`. This verb is the group's only body-writing
  verb, so `--epic` reading the pitch on stdin is the epic's one path to that section; an earlier
  revision read no stdin here, which required a section it left no way to write.

## `triage apply`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika triage apply 7 --type bug --priority p2 --ready-for agent --home 47
fabrika triage apply 7 --type chore --priority p2 --ready-for agent --lane axis:pipeline-hardening
fabrika triage apply 7 --type bug --priority p2 --ready-for agent --home 47 --token <claim-token>
fabrika triage apply 5 --type bug --priority p1 --ready-for agent --home 47 --blocked-by 4
fabrika triage apply 7 --type feature --priority p2 --ready-for agent --home 47 --class ui
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the issue to stamp |
| `--type` | enum | yes | — | one of `bug`, `feature`, `chore`, `decision`, `investigation`, `epic` |
| `--priority` | enum | yes | — | one of `p0`, `p1`, `p2` |
| `--ready-for` | enum | yes | — | who picks it up: `human` or `agent` |
| `--home` | integer | one of | — | the **number** of an open milestone to home the issue in |
| `--lane` | enum | one of | — | a standing lane, taking its values from the `lane` rows `triage homes` prints |
| `--class` | enum | no | none | the artifact class its lane routes shells off, stamped as `class:<name>`; **repeatable**, one of `code`, `doc`, `skill`, `ui` |
| `--blocked-by` | integer | no | none | an issue this one waits on, written as a native `blocked_by` edge; **repeatable**, idempotent, and never a pull request (`21`) |
| `--token` | string | no | none | the claim token `triage claim` handed this lane; without it the guard reads the session alone and refuses once two lanes of it hold live markers |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |

### `--blocked-by` — the one triage route to the dependency graph

The native `blocked_by` graph is the one carrier of "do not start this yet", and until this flag no
triage verb could write one: `map ticket` was `addBlockedBy`'s only caller, and only for a wayfinding
map's own tickets. So a triager filing an ordered slice set had the graph API one import away and no
sanctioned way to reach it, and wrote the ordering as prose — which is the failure a founder ruling
closed by adding this flag.

Three properties, each a refusal rather than a hope:

- **Every target is resolved before any edge — or any label — is written.** The POST body takes the
  target's **internal `id`**, never its issue number (passing a number silently addresses a different
  issue), so each value is resolved through `internalId` first. A target **proven absent (404)** is
  `7` with nothing written anywhere; a resolve that merely failed is `11`.
- **The edges already live are read first and skipped**, so re-running leaves exactly one edge and
  exits `0`. That is what makes a resumed lane safe, and it rests on a read this verb performs rather
  than on an assumption about how the API answers a duplicate POST.
- **The read-back is over the graph, not over the POST responses.** After the writes the verb re-reads
  `blocked_by` and proves every requested number is in it: a write it believes landed and a graph that
  carries the edge are different facts, and only the second gates a build lane. A requested edge absent
  from that read is `9`; a write that failed outright is `8`.

`--blocked-by <this issue>` is refused on `7`: a self-edge makes the issue permanently unbuildable and
`build eligible` would report it as a real blocker.

**A target that is a pull request is refused on `21`, and the message says where the edge belongs.**
`GET /repos/{o}/{r}/issues/<n>` serves pull requests — a PR number answers 200 with an `id` — so one
resolves `Present` and the proven-absent `7` arm above can never fire for it. The graph already rules
the case: *a blocking pull request is named in the graph by the issue its merge closes*, so pass that
issue's number. Its own seat rather than `7`'s, because "no such issue" is false about a number the
caller is looking at.

**Exactly one of `--home` / `--lane` is required.** Supplying both, or neither, is a usage error. This
is the whole design: an un-homed `status:triaged` issue is **unrepresentable** rather than detected
afterwards, so the verb never needs to judge homing — a question already enforced by a CI guard
firing on the very label it applies. Requiring the input is a precondition; recomputing the verdict
would be a second answer to a gated question.

**Every classification value is a closed enum decoded at the boundary**, not a free string checked in
prose. `--priority 1` is refused before any write.

**`--ready-for agent` asserts the acceptance-criteria block, and refuses on `16` before writing any
label.** The live body is read through the same wire module every downstream grader reads
(`packages/fabrika-cli/src/wire/acceptance-criteria.ts`), and anything it does not answer `Found` on
is refused: `ready-for:agent` promises a builder can pick the issue up cold, and the block is what
the promise is made of. The refusal names the reader's own reason and routes by arm — a `Malformed`
block goes to `triage repair-criteria`, an `Absent` one has nothing to repair mechanically and goes
back through `enrich`. Stamping over it instead defers the discovery to `review criteria`, after a
branch, a build, a push, a PR and a CI run are spent — one adopting repo burned exactly that
sequence on a stamped issue whose block was absent.

**`--type epic` is exempt, and the exemption is load-bearing.** A triaged epic carries a `## Pitch`
and gets its criteria later, per child, from the plan ledger, so a blanket refusal would make an epic
unstampable. The exemption is its own test on the type and stands on that alone: under
`--ready-for agent` the epic is separately left unstamped (below), a sibling rule keyed on the same
type rather than this door's cause or its consequence. `--ready-for human` is unaffected on every
type: the promise the block backs is the one made to an agent.

**`--type epic --ready-for agent` stamps no audience label at all.** `check-epic-plan` documents
itself as the only owner of `ready-for:agent` on an epic — it writes the label when that epic's plan
floor comes back clean — and triage writing it too made the label mean "triaged" rather than
"gated", so an ungated or defectively planned epic read pickable to anything filtering on it — one
live epic reached its gate already carrying the stamp, and only a floor that happened to come back
clean kept that run from being a real one. The audience facet's keep set is empty here: no label is
written, and the read-back asserts the epic carries **no** `ready-for:` at all. It still *owns*
`ready-for:*`, so a stamp an earlier gate run left is reconciled away rather than preserved —
re-classifying an epic sends it back through the gate, which is the same ownership rule read the
other way. The exemption belongs to the epic and the agent audience together: `--ready-for human`
still stamps on every type, because parking an epic for a person is triage's own claim and one the
gate never makes.

**Output** — machine channel. One tab-separated line: `triaged`, `<number>`, `<type>`, `<priority>`,
`<ready-for>`, `<home>`, `<blocked-by>`, `<classes>` — where `<home>` is the milestone number or the
lane label, `<blocked-by>` is the edge set **this run read back**, rendered `#a,#b`, and `<classes>`
is the class set this run stamped, rendered `a,b` and empty when none was asked for. With `--json`,
an object with those keys plus `removed` (the labels superseded), `blockedBy` (that same edge set, as
numbers), `classes` (the stamped stems) and `readBack`, an object of `{labels, milestone}` observed
after the write.

**`<ready-for>` reports the stamp, not the flag.** On the one run that writes no audience label —
`--type epic --ready-for agent` — the column is the literal `none` and `--json` carries
`"readyFor": null`, with a stderr line naming `check-epic-plan` as the flip's owner. Printing the
asked-for `agent` there is exactly the `landed ?? requested` fallback this verb's read-back exists to
refuse. `none` is off the `--ready-for` vocabulary (`human`, `agent`), so it can never be read as a
value that landed.

**The column is always present, and on a run passing no `--blocked-by` it is always empty** —
whatever the live graph holds. This verb reads the dependency endpoint only when the flag is there,
so an empty column means *this run wrote no edge*, never *the issue waits on nothing*. Read the
graph with `fabrika build eligible <n>` or the issue's own dependency list; concluding "no
prerequisites" from an empty column here is the same false safety `20` exists to close.

**`readBack` carries the milestone, not only the labels.** A labels-only read-back cannot evidence a
`--home` at all — the flag's entire effect is a milestone — so it reported success over the one facet
it never looked at.

**The transition is one envelope, and the read-back proves the end state positively.** The verb
re-reads the issue's labels and milestone and asserts the positive shape required — exactly one
`type:`, exactly one `p*`, `status:triaged` present, exactly one `ready-for:` (**none** on
`--type epic --ready-for agent`), `status:needs-triage` absent, and the home: with `--home`, the
milestone number equals the flag; **with `--lane`, the milestone is `null`**. It does **not** assert on the
absence of an imagined failure, and it never reports the requested classification as the landed one.

### `--class` — the producer of the lane's build/review routing

The lane machine reads `context.<task>.classes` and routes its `class:<name>`-guarded arms off it —
`build:ui` instead of `build`, `review:ui` instead of `review`. Until this flag **nothing in the tree
wrote that field**: the committed coder template shipped `"classes": []`, `lane open` copied it
byte-identically, and every class a lane ever carried arrived on an event a head had already raised
off a diff. So half of the wiring the ui-lane decision record added was unreachable on the ordinary
path — a rendered-surface lane's *first* build ran in the plain `builder`, which has none of the
design law loaded, and reached `build:ui` only after a `review-ui` FAIL.

The direction is a founder ruling: **triage writes the class, and the lane reads it at open.** The
plan-ledger alternative was not taken.

**The vocabulary is closed in code, and the labels are minted from it.** It is `SHIP_CLASS_NAMES` —
the same partition `review scope` and `ship scope` derive a diff's classes from — so a repo cannot
declare a class no gate can ever raise. That is the one asymmetry against the other five facets,
whose values come off `boardVocabulary`. The four `class:*` labels are still labels a board has to
carry: `status bootstrap label-taxonomy` creates them from that same closed set, and until a repo has
run it this flag refuses on **`7`** for every value, because the verb will not write a label the API
would have to create. An off-set spelling refuses on **`10`** with the known set printed,
before any label is written, because a `class:UI` label matches no `class:<name>` arm: the lane
routes as unclassed and says nothing, which is the same silent miss `lane report --class` refuses at
its own exit `38`.

**The facet owns `class:*` whatever a run keeps**, so re-triaging without `--class` strips the class
the issue was carrying. A facet that only added would leave two classes standing and route on
whichever was read first — the delete this engine exists to make deliberate.

**Both boot verbs read the label, and both refuse an off-set spelling before placement** — `lane
open` on the issue's own labels, `lane emit` on every live child's, each at its own exit `38` with
nothing written. The compiler refuses an off-set spelling too, but on *read*, so it is the backstop
rather than the guard: a document that compiles `Malformed` is refused by every later fold of that
lane, which bricks it rather than stopping the boot.

**What a `ui` class buys differs by path.** A single-issue lane gets the
template's own pair, `build:ui` and `review:ui`. An emitted epic child gets `build:ui` and **no**
`review:ui`: a child opens no pull request, so a rendered-review cell it entered could produce
nothing, and its rendered review is the epic tail's by construction. The tail's region carries the
`review:ui` that debt is paid in, and it carries no `build:ui` — a rendered class on an epic child
picks a builder, and a rendered class relayed on the tail picks a reviewer.

### The owned facets — what `apply` may remove

Closed input enums fix the *write*. They do not fix the *delete*, and that incident's actual
mechanism was a delete: `p2` was removed because the priority facet owned `/^p\d+$/` and `p2` was not
in the keep set. So the ownership rule is stated here rather than left for an implementer to invent:

| Facet | Owned | Kept |
|---|---|---|
| type | `^type:` | `type:<--type>` |
| priority | `^p\d+$` | `<--priority>` |
| status | `^status:(needs-triage\|triaged\|needs-info)$` | `status:triaged` |
| audience | `^ready-for:` | `ready-for:<--ready-for>`, or **none** with `--type epic --ready-for agent` |
| lane | exactly the labels `boardVocabulary.standingLanes` declares — nothing in a repo that declares none | `<--lane>`, or none when `--home` was given |
| class | `^class:` | `class:<--class>` for each, or **none** when the flag was not passed |
| **milestone** | the issue's milestone, whatever it is | `--home`'s number, or **none** when `--lane` was given |

**Every label matching an owned pattern and not in the keep set is removed; every label matching no
owned pattern is preserved untouched.** An `area:*`, a `fabrika`, a `wave:*` — none is this verb's
business, and a reconcile that removes what it does not own is a silent data loss.

**The milestone is a facet, and it was missing.** The lane row cleared a lane label when `--home` was
given, but nothing cleared a milestone when `--lane` was given, and the read-back asserted only that
the home was present. That combination lands the state the home rule explicitly bans: a milestone on
a lane-exempt item. The verb could produce a banned state and read it back as correct. With the
facet and the `milestone is null` assertion, `--lane` clears the
milestone and proves it cleared.

**Because `--priority` is a closed enum, the priority facet's owned pattern can never be wider than
what `--priority` can emit** — which is precisely the invariant v1 broke. The generalised rule: for
every facet, the set of values the input can produce must be a subset of what the facet owns. An
implementer adding a facet must re-check that containment.

### The label vocabulary is a precondition, not an assumption

Before any write, the verb asserts that **the labels this invocation will actually write** exist in
the repository: `type:<--type>`, `<--priority>`, `status:triaged`, `ready-for:<--ready-for>`, and,
with `--lane`, the lane label, and with `--class`, each class label. Only what this run writes, not
the whole vocabulary. A missing one **refuses on `7`** rather than writing.

**This is the narrow reading, deliberately.** A single `apply` writes one type, one priority, one
audience — so checking all six types and all three priorities would refuse a perfectly good
`--type bug` in a repo that merely lacks `type:investigation`, punishing an invocation for a label it
was never going to touch. The refusal message is singular for the same reason: there is exactly one
missing label to name.

This matters because the add-labels endpoint **creates an unknown label rather than rejecting it**.
`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{n}/labels` was measured against the live API on 2026-07-26: it
returns HTTP 200, and the label materialises **repo-wide** at grey `ededed` with a null description.
The measurement is recorded in `claude-plugins/kampus-pipeline/skills/doctor/doctor.sh`. That is the
mechanism behind the incident this precondition exists for — v1's `apply-triage` not validating
`--p`, so a bare `1` is applied as a literal label and reported as success. A closed enum stops a
malformed *input*; only a vocabulary check stops a well-formed input from minting a label in a repo
that was never bootstrapped.

**The endpoint is named because the alternative fails differently.** `gh issue edit --add-label`
rejects an unknown label client-side, so an implementer who reached for it would find this
precondition redundant and drop it — and the verb would start minting labels the moment it moved to
the REST call. (An older decision record states the opposite, that the endpoint 422s on an unknown
label. The measurement above is the ground truth used here, and the contradiction is filed as its
own ticket.)

(At authoring time `ready-for:human`, `ready-for:agent` and `closed-by-triage` were verified present
in the home repository with audience-only descriptions. The check exists for the repo-agnostic case
and for drift, not because they are currently absent.)

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | a label this invocation would write does not exist in the repository, the issue is closed, a `--blocked-by` target is **proven absent (404)**, or `--blocked-by` names this issue itself — nothing written |
| `21` | a `--blocked-by` target is a **pull request** — pass the issue its merge closes; nothing written |
| `8` | a label, milestone or `blocked_by` edge write failed — UNKNOWN which changes landed |
| `9` | the writes landed but the read-back does not show the required end state, or a requested `blocked_by` edge is absent from the edge read-back |
| `10` | an off-vocabulary enum value, or `--home` names a milestone that is not open |
| `11` | the issue, its comments, the claim on it, the repository's label set, its milestone set, the issue's live `blocked_by` edges, or a `--blocked-by` target's internal id could not be read |
| `17` | a live claim marker on the issue names another session — or, when `--token` named this lane, another lane of this one; a tokenless call is refused once two lanes of its session hold live markers |
| `16` | `--ready-for agent` over a live body the wire reader does not answer `Found` on — every type but `epic`; nothing was written |
| `18` | `.fabrika.jsonc` yielded no usable value — a key's load-time check refused it (the containment invariant is one such check), the file could not be read, or a key did not decode; refused at load, before the issue is even read |

The issue being proven absent is `7` as well — the same zero-scope seat, since there is no issue to
stamp.

**`milestone <n> is not open` moved off `1` and onto `10`.** Deciding it requires a network read of
the repository's milestone set, so it is a verdict the verb *proved* — and rule 3 is explicit that a
proven verdict must never share a code with a failure to invoke, or `[ $? -ne 0 ]` reads "never ran"
as "ran and proved it". It sits with the other off-vocabulary refusals because a closed milestone is
an off-vocabulary home. `1` is left for the shape error alone. A milestone set that could not be
*read* is `11`, not `10` — unread is not off-vocabulary.

**Order of operations.** The home is settled **before** `status:triaged` is applied — the milestone
assigned with `--home`, or cleared with `--lane`. The homing guard fires on the label event, so
stamping first opens a real window in which the issue is triaged and un-homed (or triaged and
banned-state milestoned) and the guard reds on the happy path — and a guard that reds on correct work
is one people learn to ignore. The verb is idempotent: re-running it converges on the same end state.

**Scope** — one issue's labels and milestone, plus the repository's label set and its open-milestone
set. There is no zero-scope case for the issue itself: it is proven present and read back, or the
verb exits `7`. The vocabulary read is what makes the `7` refusal *proven*, which is why its own
failure is `11` and never a silent pass.

```

**Grounding**

- v1's `apply-triage.sh` passes `--p` through as a free string, and the priority facet *owns* only
  `/^p\d+$/`. Running `--p 1` mints a literal label `1`, supersedes the real `p2` because `p2` is
  owned and not in the keep set, and leaves the issue reading fully triaged **with no priority at
  all** — while the verb prints a success line indistinguishable from a correct run. The closed
  enums and the positive read-back are that incident, from both ends.
- v1's tracker read-back does `const landed = landedStatus ?? status` — when the read finds no status
  label it **reports the requested one as landed**, and the type and priority labels are never
  verified at all. A read-back that falls back to the request is not a read-back.
- `status:triaged` states readiness, `ready-for:` states audience; a run that emits the first
  without the second is incomplete. Making it a required enum is what makes that structural.
- An authoring brief left in the builder's candidate pool is the failure `ready-for:human` exists to
  prevent.
- Home or standing lane, never both, never neither, and **never a milestone on a lane item**. The
  first half is enforced as a required, mutually exclusive input; the second is the milestone facet
  and the `milestone is null` assertion above.
- v1's `--status <stage>` flag is documented in its SKILL.md and **does not exist** in its script,
  which drops every argument past `$3` — so `needs-info`, one of three mandated outcomes, was
  unreachable. That outcome is `triage park` here, a first-class verb.

## `triage park`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika triage park 7 [--token <claim-token>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

The questions arrive on **stdin**.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the issue to park |
| `--token` | string | no | none | the claim token `triage claim` handed this lane; without it the guard reads the session alone and refuses once two lanes of it hold live markers |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |
| stdin | markdown | yes | — | the questions that would unblock the issue |

**Output** — machine channel. One tab-separated line: `parked`, `<number>`, `<comment-url>`. With
`--json`, an object with keys `outcome`, `number`, `commentUrl`, and `removed` (the labels dropped).

**This is a separate verb rather than `apply --status needs-info`,** because a parked issue carries
no type, no priority, no audience and no home. Folding it into `apply` would make four required flags
conditionally required — the shape that let v1 emit a fully-triaged-looking issue with a facet
missing.

### The owned facets — what `park` may remove

Stating the end state is not enough; a verb that asserts "a parked issue carries no type" and then
reads back only its own two labels will certify an issue that carries five. That gap is reachable
without any misuse: a re-park, or an issue parked after an earlier `apply`, arrives already priced.

| Facet | Owned pattern | Kept |
|---|---|---|
| status | `^status:(needs-triage\|triaged\|needs-info)$` | `status:needs-info` |
| type | `^type:` | none |
| priority | `^p\d+$` | none |
| audience | `^ready-for:` | none |
| lane | exactly the labels `boardVocabulary.standingLanes` declares — nothing in a repo that declares none | none |
| milestone | the issue's milestone | none — cleared |

Every label matching an owned pattern is removed unless it is the one kept; every label matching no
owned pattern is preserved untouched. **The read-back asserts the whole shape**, not just the status
swap: `status:needs-info` present, `status:needs-triage` and `status:triaged` both absent, no
`type:`, no `p*`, no `ready-for:`, no lane label, and the milestone null. `removed` in the `--json`
object is exactly the set this reconcile deleted, so the example's `["status:needs-triage"]` is the
ordinary case — an issue arriving straight from the queue with nothing else to clear.

**Parking a triaged issue is a demotion, and it must leave no residue.** An issue reading both
`status:triaged` and `status:needs-info` corrupts the two queue reads every other verb and the sweep
depend on, and the read-back that is supposed to catch that is the thing that would otherwise certify
it.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing — a park with no questions is not a park |
| `5` | the questions carry a machine-local path |
| `6` | the questions are a bare `@` path reference — they never arrived |
| `7` | the issue is proven absent (404), is closed, or `status:needs-info` does not exist in the repository |
| `8` | the comment or the label swap failed — UNKNOWN which landed |
| `9` | the writes landed but the read-back does not match |
| `11` | the issue, its comments, the claim on it, or the repository's label set could not be read |
| `17` | a live claim marker on the issue names another session — or, when `--token` named this lane, another lane of this one; a tokenless call is refused once two lanes of its session hold live markers |
| `18` | `.fabrika.jsonc` yielded no usable value — a key's load-time check refused it (the containment invariant is one such check), the file could not be read, or a key did not decode; refused at load, before the comment is posted |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `triage park: no body on stdin — a parked issue must say what would unblock it: pipe the questions in.` | 3 | refusal |
| `triage park: issue #<n> not found in <repo>.` | 7 | refusal |
| `triage park: issue #<n> is already closed.` | 7 | refusal |
| `triage park: cannot read #<n>'s comments in <repo>: <reason> — the claim on it is UNKNOWN; nothing was written.` | 11 | refusal |
| `triage park: cannot resolve the claim on #<n> in <repo>: <reason> — nothing was written.` | 11 | refusal |
| `triage park: #<n> is claimed by session <s> — refusing to mutate another session's issue. Run `fabrika triage claim <n>` and act only on `won`.` | 17 | refusal |
| `triage park: #<n> is claimed by lane <l> of this session, not by this lane (<nonce>) — refusing to mutate a sibling lane's issue. Run `fabrika triage claim <n>` and act only on `won`.` | 17 | refusal |
| `triage park: #<n> carries live claim markers from more than one lane of this session and this call names none, so which lane is asking is UNKNOWN — pass the `--token` `fabrika triage claim <n>` handed this lane.` | 17 | refusal |
| `triage park: .fabrika.jsonc is refused — <reason>. Nothing was written; fix the config, because every label this verb would reconcile is judged against it.` | 18 | refusal |
| `triage park: the questions text carries a machine-local path at line <k> (<class>) — rewrite it repo-relative.` | 5 | refusal |
| `triage park: the questions text is a bare "@" path reference — the body never arrived. Send it on stdin.` | 6 | refusal |
| `triage park: label status:needs-info does not exist in <repo> — refusing to write, because the API would create it. <remedy>` (`<remedy>` names the `fabrika status bootstrap <surface>` command that creates the label on this repo's board, says no surface creates it, or says which one is UNKNOWN when `.fabrika.jsonc` is refused) | 7 | refusal |
| `triage park: cannot read <what> in <repo>: <reason> — nothing was written; the park is UNKNOWN.` | 11 | refusal |
| `triage park: the questions comment on #<n> failed: <reason> — nothing was labelled and #<n> is unchanged. Re-run.` | 8 | refusal |
| `triage park: the questions landed but the label swap failed: <reason> — #<n> carries the questions and may be partially labelled; re-run this verb, which is idempotent.` | 8 | refusal |
| `triage park: read-back shows <observed> — expected status:needs-info present and status:needs-triage absent.` | 9 | refusal |

**The two `8` messages are split because the write order makes them different states.** The comment
is written **first**, by design, so a comment failure leaves nothing labelled at all — "may be
partially labelled" would be false, and a caller reading it would go looking for a label swap that
never started. Only the second failure can leave a partial label state.

**Scope** — one issue, plus the repository's label set for the `status:needs-info` precondition. The
read-back is the one specified under the owned facets above; it is not restated here. Parking leaves
the queue deliberately: a parked question must not resurface in every sweep, and it re-enters when
whoever answers swaps the labels back.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika triage park 8 < questions.md
parked	8	https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/8#issuecomment-5154891644
```

```
$ fabrika triage park 8 --json < questions.md
{"outcome":"parked","number":8,"commentUrl":"https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/8#issuecomment-5154891644","removed":["status:needs-triage"]}
```

**Grounding**

- v1 could not produce this outcome at all — see the last Grounding entry under `triage apply`.
- The comment is posted before the label swap, so an issue never sits on `status:needs-info` with no
  statement of what would unblock it. The write order is the guard, and it is also why the two `8`
  messages differ.

## `triage kill`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika triage kill 7 --confirm [--duplicate-of <n>] [--token <claim-token>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

The reason arrives on **stdin**.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(positional)* | integer | yes | — | the issue to close not-planned |
| `--confirm` | boolean | no | `false` | assert that the confirmation step has been performed — salvage was attempted and this filing is genuinely unsalvageable or moves nothing forward. Its absence is a **refusal on `13`**, not a usage error |
| `--duplicate-of` | integer | no | absent | the surviving issue; this issue's content is folded into it before closing |
| `--token` | string | no | none | the claim token `triage claim` handed this lane; without it the guard reads the session alone and refuses once two lanes of it hold live markers |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |
| stdin | markdown | yes | — | the reason this issue is being closed not-planned |

**`--confirm` is optional at the parser and refused at the verb, and that is not a contradiction —
it is the point.** A parser-required flag's absence is a usage error, exit `1`, indistinguishable
from a typo. The confirmation is a *decision*, so its absence must be a proven refusal the
caller can read as one: exit `13`, with a message naming what to do. An earlier revision marked it
`Required: yes` with `Default: false`, which is incoherent and contradicted its own exit table.

**Output** — machine channel. One tab-separated line: `killed`, `<number>`, `<foldedInto>` — where
`<foldedInto>` is the surviving issue number or `none`. With `--json`, an object with keys `outcome`,
`number`, `foldedInto` (number or `null`), `redactions` (count masked from the folded body), and
`provenance` (the value this verb read for itself).

**Two guards, and they are different guards.** The rule splits the population in two and puts a
distinct protection on each half; a spec that implements one and drops the other has narrowed an
accepted decision.

1. **No agent signal ⇒ human-owned ⇒ PROTECTED.** The verb runs the `triage provenance` predicate
   itself rather than trusting the caller to have run it — the anchored footer match **and** the
   operator-account test, both from the one definition. A `human` answer — no footer *and* an author
   outside `$FABRIKA_OPERATOR_ACCOUNTS`, including the fail-closed default on an **empty** body —
   refuses on exit `12`. When the operator set is unconfigured the refusal carries a stderr notice
   saying so, because otherwise "the config is empty" and "this really is a human filing" produce an
   identical refusal. An **unreadable** body is exit `11`, not a `human` verdict: the kill is refused
   either way, but a caller must never be told the issue was measured as human-filed when nothing was
   measured. **`--duplicate-of` is the one exception, and it is conditional rather than merely
   later**: a fold moves the content into an open survivor instead of discarding it, so the
   protection it exists to give — the report survives somewhere a human will read it — is already
   discharged. Gating on the flag rather than reordering the test is
   what keeps `12` ahead of `13` on the non-fold path; a human filing with neither flag still refuses
   on `12`, and one with `--duplicate-of` and no `--confirm` still refuses on `13`.
2. **An agent signal ⇒ eligible *after confirmation*, and "the confirmation step IS the guard."**
   A human-invoked `/report` also emits the footer, so footer presence alone is **not** licence to
   close — a confirmation-free close-sweep stays an explicitly re-opened question.
   `--confirm` is that step made structural: without it the verb refuses on exit `13`, so an
   autonomous sweep cannot close on footer presence alone, and the flag is a greppable, auditable act
   rather than a thing the model was supposed to remember.

**The duplicate fold is redacted.** With `--duplicate-of`, this issue's body is posted as a comment on
the surviving issue **through the same redaction `triage enrich` applies**, before this issue is
closed. v1 redacted the enrich path and left this one raw — the same body, copied into a new public
location, with the leak matcher literally named for comments.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `3` | stdin was read and held nothing — an unauditable kill |
| `5` | the reason text carries a machine-local path |
| `6` | the reason is a bare `@` path reference — it never arrived |
| `7` | the issue is proven absent or already closed; `--duplicate-of` is proven absent or closed; or `closed-by-triage` does not exist in the repository |
| `8` | one of the four steps failed — the message names what did and did not land |
| `9` | the writes landed but the read-back does not show a not-planned close, or still shows a triage status label |
| `11` | the issue body, its comments, the claim on it, the duplicate, or the label set could not be read — no kill was attempted |
| `17` | a live claim marker on the issue names another session — or, when `--token` named this lane, another lane of this one; a tokenless call is refused once two lanes of its session hold live markers |
| `12` | refused: the issue is human-filed — no agent footer and no operator author — and no `--duplicate-of` was named (the fold exception, above) |
| `13` | refused: close-eligible, but `--confirm` was absent |

| `triage kill: redacted <k> machine-local path(s) from the folded duplicate body.` | 0 | notice |

**Write order is the auditability guarantee.** Fold the duplicate content, post the reason comment,
write the labels, then close with `state_reason=not_planned` — and **each step gates the next**. v1 ran three unguarded sequential writes under `set -uo pipefail` with no `-e`, so a failed
reason comment did not stop the close: the issue landed closed, unexplained, and invisible to the
kill audit. Here a failure before the close leaves the issue **open**, which is the recoverable
direction.

**All four steps therefore carry their own `8` message**, each naming what landed, what did not, and
the recovery — because the shared conventions promise every `8` message carries one, and a single
generic "a write failed" would leave a caller unable to tell "nothing happened, re-run" from "three
comments are live, re-running duplicates them". An earlier revision covered only the fold. The
read-back asserts `state` is `closed` **and** `state_reason` is `not_planned`, because a plain
`closed` reads as "done", not "killed".

**The label step strips every triage status, through the same reconcile `apply` and `park` write
through.** A killed issue carrying `status:needs-triage` makes any count over that label that is not
filtered to open issues over-report the queue, and a kill after an earlier `apply` leaves
`status:triaged` saying the same false thing. The removals are planned by
`planReconcile` off a `killedFacets` table naming the **status facet alone**, so the strip and the
two reconciling exits cannot disagree about which statuses a triage transition owns, and every other
label — the type, priority, audience and lane the issue was read under — is preserved as the history
that makes a closed issue legible. The strip rides in the label step rather than after the close,
which is what keeps the order's guarantee: a failure there leaves the issue open. And the read-back
asserts the status facet's end state alongside `state`/`state_reason`, because the
`closed-by-triage` add lands whether or not the removals did — a read-back blind to the labels would
pass the exact defect this fixes.

**`closed-by-triage` is provenance, and the refusal on its absence stands for a different reason.**
The kill audit's key is the not-planned close itself, so the label no longer carries coverage — it
records that **triage** was the actor. The exit-`7` refusal on the label's absence is therefore
**unchanged in behaviour and changed in rationale**: the kill would not be *invisible* (the close is
the key), it would be **unattributable** — a triage kill that cannot carry its stamp is
indistinguishable from a founder-session close, which is the confusion the label exists to prevent.
Two consequences bind this verb. It gains **no** actor flag and **no** courtesy stamp: a non-triage
actor's kill does not run this verb and must not carry the label, and it stays auditable through the
close plus its reason comment. And the two shipped strings above that still read *"invisible to the
audit"* (the exit-`7` refusal and the exit-`8` label-write failure) are reworded when the v1 audit
query is re-keyed and paginated — the codes and the write order do not move.

**Scope** — one issue with its body and author login, the repository's label set, plus the surviving
issue when `--duplicate-of` is given.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika triage kill 7 --confirm --duplicate-of 8 < reason.md
killed	7	8
```

```
$ fabrika triage kill 8 --confirm < reason.md
triage kill: #8 is human-filed — refusing to close it. Park it with questions instead.
$ echo $?
12
```

```
$ fabrika triage kill 7 < reason.md
triage kill: #7 is agent-filed and close-eligible, but the confirmation is the guard — pass --confirm once salvage has genuinely been attempted.
$ echo $?
13
```

```
$ fabrika triage kill 7 --confirm --json < reason.md
{"outcome":"killed","number":7,"foldedInto":null,"redactions":0,"provenance":"agent"}
```

**Grounding**

- v1 `close-not-planned.sh:18-20` — three unguarded writes; a failed comment still closes the issue.
  It validates its *input* (an empty reason is refused) and never its *outcome*.
- v1 `fetch-duplicate-body.sh:25` → `post-duplicate-comment.sh:23` copies a body verbatim into a
  public comment with no leak pass, while `fetch-original.sh:30` redacts on the other path. One
  emitter, always redacting, removes the asymmetry.
- v1 Step 5 — human-filed issues are never auto-closed. v1 stated it in 48 lines of prose
  and computed it nowhere. The operator-set ruling narrows *who counts as human-filed*, not the
  protection: a footerless filing from a non-operator is as protected as it ever was. The fold
  ruling narrows the protection itself, on one path only — a `--duplicate-of` fold, which preserves
  the content in an open survivor rather than discarding it.
- v1 `audit-kills.sh` — the compensating control for the whole kill path — reads one unpaginated
  page, so it goes blind past 30 kills with no truncation signal, and it keys on the label, so it
  cannot see a kill any other actor executed (the audit is re-keyed onto the close itself). This
  spec does not re-mint that verb; the audit belongs to a board surface, and the fail-closed write
  order above is what makes a kill auditable at the moment it happens.

---

## `triage repair-criteria`

This section carries the derivation the verb's `--help` used to state. Its callers read the
invocation, outcomes and exits from `fabrika triage repair-criteria --help`; it is not yet a full
specification, which is why the exit matrix above still has no `14` row.

**What it rewrites.** An acceptance-criteria block's shape, and nothing else: a level-drifted
`## Acceptance criteria` heading to the conforming `### Acceptance criteria`, and, when the block
carries no checkbox at all, its plain list bullets to unchecked checkboxes. Each item's text stays
byte-for-byte unchanged. It touches the authored region only and leaves preserved originals
byte-for-byte untouched, and the repair is pre-verified through the wire read before anything is
written.

**What it refuses on `14`.** Only a pure shape rewrite on the exact heading text is repaired. A
drifted heading text, a block mixing prose or another block into the list, an empty item, a block
that already carries a checkbox beside its bullets, and a converted bullet the reader counts no
criterion at are all refused, never guessed. A `Repaired` plan reads back exactly one criterion per
line it rewrote.

**One issue or the board.** One issue by number, or `--sweep` for every open issue with one outcome
line each. A sweep re-reads each issue immediately before its write and answers `moved` instead of
writing when the body changed after the board snapshot. `--dry-run` plans everything and writes
nothing, answering `would-repair` with the repairs it would make.

**Write order.** Every repaired body gets one disclosure comment naming its repairs, posted after the
read-back.

---

## `triage sweep-homes`

The apply side of `guard homing-guard check`. It clears the milestone on every double-marked
`status:triaged` issue, keeps its standing-lane label, and leaves one trail comment on it. It lists
every un-homed issue and changes nothing on those.

**Invocation**

```
fabrika triage sweep-homes [--dry-run | --apply] [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

Under `--apply`, the trail citation arrives on **stdin**.

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | boolean | no | `false` | print the per-issue plan and write nothing; a run with neither flag does the same |
| `--apply` | boolean | no | `false` | clear each double-marked issue's milestone and post its trail comment |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved | the repository |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the result object |
| stdin | markdown | under `--apply` | — | the citation every trail comment carries: the decision and ruling the sweep runs under |

Passing both `--dry-run` and `--apply` exits `1`. A dry run never reads stdin.

**Output** — machine channel. A header line, then one row per double-marked issue, ascending:

- dry run: `planned\t<n>`, then `would-clear\t<number>\t<milestone>\t<lanes>` rows;
- apply: `swept\t<cleared>\t<moved>`, then `cleared\t<number>\t<milestone>\t<lanes>\t<trail-url>`
  rows (`trail-existing` in place of the URL when an earlier trail was found) and
  `moved\t<number>\t<milestone>\t<lanes>\t<reason>` rows.

`<lanes>` is comma-joined. With `--json`, an object with keys `outcome` (`planned` or `swept`),
`scanned`, and `issues` (each row's `outcome`, `number`, `milestone`, `lanes`, and `trail` or
`reason` where the row has one). Stderr carries the scanned line and a tally line,
`triage sweep-homes: <d> double-marked, <u> un-homed, <h> homed, <e> exempt.`

**The decision is the guard's.** The verb reads the open `status:triaged` set with the guard's own
read and record mapping, and judges it with `judge`/`resolve` from `guard/homing.ts`, against the
same lanes — the ones `boardVocabulary.standingLanes` declares. It never parses the guard's report.
So this verb computes no second homing verdict, and the refusal of a `triage homing-check` verb
above still holds. A repo that declares no lane has no double-marked issue to clear, and a
declaration that could not be read is `11`, never "no lanes".

**Which breach it applies.** A double-marked issue has one mechanical remedy: a standing lane is
milestone-less by design, so the milestone goes and the lane stays. An un-homed issue has three
(home it, lane it, kill it), and choosing is triage's judgment. The verb prints each un-homed issue
on stderr as `unhomed\t<number>\t<title>`, with the guard's three-way remedy, writes nothing to it,
and exits `27`. The double-marked clears in the same run still land first.

**Write order, per issue.** Re-read the issue, and answer `moved` without writing when it is no
longer open or no longer carries the planned milestone beside a standing lane. Read its comments
reconciled against the count the issue declares for itself, so a trail posted moments earlier is not
missed by a short list; a list still short after its re-reads is `11`, never a missing trail. Post
the trail unless one carrying this milestone's marker (`<!-- fabrika:sweep-homes milestone=<m> -->`)
is already there. Clear the milestone. Read the issue back and require it milestone-less with every
planned lane kept. The trail lands before the clear so a run that died between the two can be
re-run: the breach is still on the board, and the trail is found rather than posted twice. A second
run over a fully swept board plans nothing and writes nothing.

**It takes no claim.** Unlike `enrich`, `apply`, `park`, `kill` and `split`, this verb reads no
per-issue claim marker and has no `--token` flag. A sweep spans the whole triaged board, so it
cannot hold one claim per issue, and it has no need to: it makes no triage judgment on any issue.
Its only writes are the guard's mechanical remedy and the trail naming it, applied to an issue
re-read just before the write and skipped as `moved` when that re-read shows the breach changed.

**The trail comment** states the milestone removed and the lane kept, then carries the stdin
citation, then the marker. Which decision and ruling govern homing is the adopting repository's
fact, so the citation is the caller's. Every trail is composed and leak-scanned before the first
write.

**Exit status**

| Trigger | Code |
|---|---|
| `--apply` with an empty stdin | 3 |
| the citation carries a machine-local path | 5 |
| the citation is a bare `@` reference | 6 |
| the open `status:triaged` set is empty — fail-closed, never a clean sweep | 7 |
| a trail or milestone write failed; the message says which, and a re-run is safe | 8 |
| the read-back after a clear is not milestone-less with the lanes kept | 9 |
| the backlog, a re-read issue, its comments or `.fabrika.jsonc`'s lane declaration could not be read | 11 |
| un-homed issues remain, listed on stderr and untouched | 27 |

A halt on `8`, `9` or `11` mid-sweep prints each row already done on stderr, prefixed
`before the halt:`, and touches no later issue.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika triage sweep-homes
planned	1
would-clear	8	47	axis:pipeline-hardening
```

```
$ fabrika triage sweep-homes --apply < citation.md
swept	1	0
cleared	8	47	axis:pipeline-hardening	https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/8#issuecomment-1

## `triage audit-set`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika triage audit-set --label <name> [--repo <owner/name>] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--label` | string | yes | none | the label whose open issues form the audit set |
| `--repo` | string | no | resolved (see Shared conventions) | the repository to read |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the full result object instead of the line grammar |

**Output** — machine channel. The first line is the outcome token alone: `set` or `empty`. On `set`,
one **tab-separated** line per issue follows — `<number>`, `<title>` — ascending by number, never
truncated.

With `--json`, one object with keys `outcome`, `label`, `repo`, `issues` (array of
`{number, title}`), and `scanned` (integer, equal to the length of `issues`). This object is the
`--input` document `triage audit-merge` reads.

Stderr carries the scanned count as a scope line in both modes.

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | `--label` does not exist in the repository — the set would scan nothing |
| `11` | the label set or the issue list could not be read — the set is UNKNOWN, never `empty` |

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `triage audit-set: label <label> does not exist in <repo> — refusing to report an empty audit set over zero scope. <remedy>` (`<remedy>` names the `fabrika status bootstrap <surface>` command that creates the label on this repo's board, says no surface creates it, or says which one is UNKNOWN when `.fabrika.jsonc` is refused) | 7 | refusal |
| `triage audit-set: cannot read the label set of <repo>: <reason> — whether the <label> audit set exists is UNKNOWN, and so is the outcome.` | 11 | refusal |
| `triage audit-set: cannot read the open <label> issues in <repo>: <reason> — the audit set is UNKNOWN, never "empty".` | 11 | refusal |
| `triage audit-set: --label must name a label.` | 1 | usage error |

**Scope** — every open issue in `--repo` carrying `--label`, read with pagination, pull requests
excluded. It shares `triage queue`'s read and its label precondition, and differs in two ways an
audit needs. **The label has no default**, so the set an audit judges is always the one its caller
named. **Nothing is truncated**, because `audit-merge` checks its rows against this set and a capped
set would let a merge pass over a subset.

**It reads and never writes.** Its requests are the label-set read and the paged issue list, both
`GET`s; its unit test asserts that every request it sends is one.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika triage audit-set --label status:triaged
set
4290	Retry helper swallows the abort reason
4312	Definition editor loses focus after an entry is saved
```

```
$ fabrika triage audit-set --label status:triaged --json
{"outcome":"set","label":"status:triaged","repo":"<owner>/<repo>","issues":[{"number":4290,"title":"Retry helper swallows the abort reason"}],"scanned":1}
```

## `triage audit-merge`

**Invocation**

```
fabrika triage audit-merge --input <file> --chunk <file> [--chunk <file>…] [--json]
```

**Inputs**

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--input` | file | yes | none | the audited set, as `triage audit-set --json` printed it |
| `--chunk` | file | yes, repeatable | none | one chunk result |
| `--json` | boolean | no | `false` | emit the full result object instead of the line grammar |

**The verdict row** — one pinned shape, decoded by `parseVerdictRow` in
`packages/fabrika-cli/src/triage/audit.ts`:

```json
{"issue": 4312, "verdict": "KILL", "clause": "superseded", "evidence": "the retry helper rewrite already fixed it"}
```

| Key | Rule |
|---|---|
| `issue` | required; a positive integer |
| `verdict` | required; exactly `KILL`, `DECIDE` or `KEEP` |
| `clause` | required on a `KILL` and refused on any other verdict; one of `process-ceremony`, `self-generated-churn`, `hardening-with-no-incident`, `superseded`, `duplicate-of-parent` — the value bar's clauses in the skill |
| `evidence` | required; one non-blank line, no tab or line break |

Any other key is refused, so a misspelt `clause` cannot pass as an absent one.

**The chunk** — `{"declared": <n>, "rows": [<verdict row>…]}`. `declared` is the number of rows the
chunk says it holds, and it is kept apart from `rows` because comparing the two is the merge's first
check.

**Output** — machine channel. The first line is the outcome token `merged`, then one
**tab-separated** line per audited issue, ascending — `<number>`, `<verdict>`, `<clause>` (`-` on a
`DECIDE` or `KEEP`), `<evidence>`. Stderr carries the per-verdict counts. With `--json`, one object
with keys `outcome`, `rows` (the verdict rows) and `counts` (`{KILL, DECIDE, KEEP}`).

**Exit status**

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `7` | the input set lists no issues — a merge over zero scope proves nothing |
| `11` | the input file or a chunk file could not be read — the merge is UNKNOWN |
| `22` | a file is not JSON, the input set's `scanned` differs from the issues it lists, or a row breaks the pinned shape |
| `23` | a chunk's rows differ from its `declared` total |
| `24` | one issue carries more than one verdict row, within one chunk or across chunks |
| `25` | the merged issue set is not the input set — an issue has no row, or a row names an issue the input set does not list |

Every refusal prints nothing on stdout, so no merged output exists to act on.

**Errors**

| Message (stderr) | Code | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `triage audit-merge: the input set <file> lists no issues — refusing to merge over zero scope.` | 7 | refusal |
| `triage audit-merge: cannot read <input set\|chunk> <file>: <reason> — the merge is UNKNOWN.` | 11 | refusal |
| `triage audit-merge: <chunk>: row <k>: #<n>: a KILL names no value-bar clause.` | 22 | refusal |
| `triage audit-merge: <chunk> declares <n> rows and carries <m>.` (one per chunk), then the refusal line | 23 | refusal |
| `triage audit-merge: #<n> is judged in <chunk>, <chunk>.` (one per issue), then the refusal line | 24 | refusal |
| `triage audit-merge: the merged rows are not the audited set — missing <#n…\|none>; not in the input set <#n…\|none>.` | 25 | refusal |
| `triage audit-merge: name at least one --chunk.` | 1 | usage error |

**Scope** — the checks run in a fixed order: every chunk's count first, because a short chunk would
otherwise surface as a missing issue and hide which chunk lost it; then duplicates; then the set
comparison. **The verb never repairs.** A missing row goes back to a reader; it is never rebuilt,
because a rebuilt row is a verdict no reader gave.

**It never touches the issue tracker.** Its only dependency is the filesystem — the
`FileSystem` service is the whole of its requirement type — and its unit tests run it over a scripted
filesystem with no HTTP seam provided.

**Examples**

```
$ fabrika triage audit-merge --input set.json --chunk a.json --chunk b.json
merged
4290	KEEP	-	the abort reason is still dropped at main
4312	KILL	superseded	the retry helper rewrite already fixed it
```

```
$ fabrika triage audit-merge --input set.json --chunk a.json --chunk b.json
triage audit-merge: b.json declares 2 rows and carries 1.
triage audit-merge: 1 chunk(s) hold a different number of rows than they declare — re-collect them; a missing row is never rebuilt by hand.
$ echo $?
23
```

## `report dedup — the --exclude extension`

`fabrika report dedup --query "definition editor loses focus" --exclude 7` omits the issue being
triaged. Invocation and output grammar are in `fabrika report dedup --help`; retrieval and cache
requirements belong to [the report contract](../report/contract.md#report-dedup).

Filter the excluded number from the live queue and indexed corpus before either ranking selects
its top 20 and before the final `--limit`. It cannot consume a candidate slot or match itself.
Corpus-dependent scores may change when a document is removed. A number absent from both sources
is harmless and filters nothing.

Excluding the only lexical match produces `none`, not `indeterminate`. The latter is reserved for
queries below the two-word floor. `none` describes the observed search scope, not proof that no
paraphrased duplicate exists.

This extension adds no exit codes. The report group's codes apply: 7 for a missing queue label,
27 for an unreadable queue, and 28 for an unreadable issue corpus. All three outcome tokens still
exit 0. A closed candidate needs inspection before it can count as fixed work.
